<h3>About this Course</h3>

<p>This course is the third in our JavaScript for Beginners Specialization. The 
scripts will become more complex and introduce more complex jQuery plugins. You 
will have several challenges to practice your skills throughout the course.</p>
<p>The course objectives include how to identify objects in JavaScript; create 
new objects and populate them with data; manipulate objects by adding, modifying 
and deleting data in objects; manipulate the DOM based on the data in objects; 
identify and articulate how multiple functions work together to create a more complex 
program; and identify processes for breaking larger programs into smaller, more 
manageable pieces.</p>

# Preface

If you are a web designer or document author interested in sophisticated
page styling, improved accessibility, and saving time and effort, this
book is for you. All you really need to know before starting the book is
HTML 4.0. The better you know HTML, the better prepared you'll be, but
it is not a requirement. You will need to know very little else to
follow this book.

This fifth edition of the book was finished at the end of 2022 and does
its best to reflect the state of CSS at that time. Anything covered in
detail either had wide browser support at the time of writing or was
known to be coming soon after publication. CSS features that were still
being developed or were known to have support dropping soon are not
covered here.

# Conventions Used in This Book {#preface01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_2}

The following typographical conventions are used in this book (but make
sure to read through ["Value Syntax
Conventions"](#preface01.xhtml_value_syntax_conventions){data-type="xref"}
to see how some of these are modified):

*Italic*

:   Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file
    extensions.

`Constant width`

:   Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to
    program elements such as variable or function names, databases, data
    types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.

*`Constant width italic`*

:   Shows text that should be replaced with user-supplied values or by
    values determined by context.

## Value Syntax Conventions {#preface01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_6}

Throughout this []{#preface01.xhtml_ix_values_syntax_conv
primary="values" secondary="syntax conventions"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_ix_syntax_conv_pref
primary="syntax conventions used in this book"
data-type="indexterm"}book, boxes explain a given CSS property's
details, including which values are permitted. This content has been
reproduced practically verbatim from the CSS specifications, but some
explanation of the syntax is in order.

The allowed values for each property are listed with a syntax like the
following:

**Value:** \<*`family-name`*\>#

**Value:** \<*`url`*\> ‖ \<*`color`*\>

**Value:** \<*`url`*\>? \<*`color`*\> \[ / \<*`color`*\> \]?

**Value:** \[ \<*`length`*\> \| `thick` \| `thin` \]{1,4}

**Value:** \[ \<*`background`*\>, \]\* \<*`background-color`*\>

Any []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797088674192
primary="/ (forward slash), in value syntax"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797092223744
primary="forward slash (/), in value syntax"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797092165408
primary="slashes" secondary="forward slash"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797092164464
primary="<…​> (angle brackets), in value syntax"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797088223744
primary="angle brackets (<…​>), in value syntax"
data-type="indexterm"}italicized words between `<` and `>` give a type
of value, or a reference to another property's values. For example, the
property `font` accepts values that originally belong to the property
`font-family`. This is denoted by using the text \<*`font-family`*\>.
Similarly, if a value type like a color is permitted, it will be
represented using \<*`color`*\>.

Any words presented in `constant width` are keywords that must appear
literally, without quotes. The forward slash (`/`) and the comma (,)
must also be used literally.

Components of a value definition can be combined in numerous ways:

-   Two or more keywords strung together with only space separating them
    means that all of them must occur in the given order. For example,
    `help me` would mean that the property must use those keywords in
    that order.

-   []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797108502928
    primary="| (vertical bar), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797108502176
    primary="vertical bar (|), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm"}If
    a vertical bar separates alternatives (*`X`* \| *`Y`*), any one of
    them must occur, but only one. Given \[ *`X`* \| *`Y`* \| *`Z`* \]
    any one of *`X`*, *`Y`*, or *`Z`* is permitted.

-   A []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797136981904
    primary="|| (vertical bar, double), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797114305680
    primary="vertical bar, double (||), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}vertical double bar (*`X`* ‖ *`Y`*) means that
    *`X`*, *`Y`*, or both must occur, but they may appear in any order.
    Thus: *`X`*, *`Y`*, *`X`* *`Y`*, and *`Y`* *`X`* are all valid
    interpretations.

-   A []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797088270448
    primary="&& (ampersand, double), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797138730464
    primary="ampersand, double (&&), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}double ampersand (*`X`* && *`Y`*) means both
    *`X`* and *`Y`* must occur, though they may appear in any order.
    Thus: *`X`* *`Y`* or *`Y`* *`X`* are both valid interpretations.

-   Brackets (\[...​\]) are for []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797088749408
    primary="square brackets ([…​]), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797114403936
    primary="[…​] (square brackets), in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm"}grouping
    things together. Thus \[`please ‖ help ‖ me`\] `do this` means that
    the words `please`, `help`, and `me` can appear in any order, though
    each appear only once. The words `do this` must always appear, in
    that order. Here are some examples: `please help me do this`,
    `help me please do this`, `me please help do this`.

Every component or bracketed group may (or may not) be followed by one
of these [modifiers:]{.keep-together}

-   An []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090550528 primary="* (asterisk)"
    secondary="in value syntax" secondary-sortas="value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090554672
    primary="asterisk (*)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm"}asterisk (\*)
    indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated
    zero or more times. Thus, `bucket`\* means that the word `bucket`
    can be used any number of times, including zero. There is no upper
    limit defined on the number of times it can be used.

-   A []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797114264608 primary="+ (plus sign)"
    secondary="in value syntax" secondary-sortas="value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797114263328
    primary="plus sign (+)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm"}plus (+)
    indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated
    one or more times. Thus, `mop`+ means that the word `mop` must be
    used at least once, and potentially many more times.

-   A []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090467984 primary="# (octothorpe)"
    secondary="in value syntax" secondary-sortas="value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090397184
    primary="hash mark (#)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090395968
    primary="number sign (#)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797088857360
    primary="octothorpe (#)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090978656
    primary="pound sign (#)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm"}hash sign (#),
    formally called an octothorpe, indicates that the preceding value or
    bracketed group is repeated one or more times, separated by commas
    as needed. Thus, `floor`\# can be `floor` or `floor, floor, floor`,
    and so on. This is most often used in conjunction with bracketed
    groups or value types.

-   A []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797136976400
    primary="question mark (?), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797114280960
    primary="? (question mark), in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}question mark (?) indicates that the preceding
    value or bracketed group is optional. For example, \[`pine tree`\]?
    means that the words `pine tree` need not be used (although they
    must appear in that order if they are used).

-   An []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090475536
    primary="! (exclamation point)" secondary="in value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797090474528
    primary="exclamation point (!)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm"}exclamation
    point (!) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is
    required, and thus must result in at least one value, even if the
    syntax would seem to indicate otherwise. For example, \[ `what`?
    `is`? `happening`? \]! must be at least one of the three terms
    marked optional.

-   A pair of numbers in []{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797088710192
    primary="{…​} (curly braces)" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797088895632
    primary="curly braces ({…​})" secondary="in value syntax"
    secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm"}curly braces
    ({*M*,*N*}) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is
    repeated at least *M* and at most *N* times. For example, `ha`{1,3}
    means that there can be one, two, or three instances of the word
    `ha`.

The following are some examples:

[`give` ‖ `me` ‖ `liberty`]{.dt_plain}

:   At least one of the three words must be used, and they can be used
    in any order. For example, `give liberty`, `give me`,
    `liberty me give`, and `give me liberty` are all valid
    interpretations.

[\[ `I` \| `am` \]? `the` ‖ `walrus`]{.dt_plain}

:   Either the word `I` or `am` may be used, but not both, and use of
    either is optional. In addition, either `the` or `walrus`, or both,
    must follow in any order. Thus you could construct `I the walrus`,
    `am walrus the`, `am the`, `I walrus`, `walrus the`, and so forth.

[`koo`+ `ka-choo`]{.dt_plain}

:   One or more instances of `koo` must be followed by `ka-choo`.
    Therefore `koo koo ka-choo`, `koo koo koo ka-choo`, and
    `koo ka-choo` are all legal. The number of `koo`s is potentially
    infinite, although there are bound to be implementation-specific
    limits.

[`I really`{1,4}? \[ `love` \| `hate` \] \[ `Microsoft` \| `Firefox` \| `Opera` \| `Safari` \| `Chrome` \]]{.dt_plain}

:   The all-purpose web designer's opinion expresser. This can be
    interpreted as `I love Firefox`, `I really love Microsoft`, and
    similar expressions. Anywhere from zero to four `really`s may be
    used, though they may *not* be separated by commas. You also get to
    pick between `love` and `hate`, which really seems like some sort of
    metaphor.

[`It’s a` \[ `mad` \]# `world`]{.dt_plain}

:   This gives the opportunity to put in as many comma-separated `mad`s
    as possible, with a minimum of one `mad`. If there is only one
    `mad`, no comma is added. Thus: `It’s a mad world` and
    `It’s a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world` are both valid results.

[\[ \[ `Alpha` ‖ `Baker` ‖ `Cray` \], \]{2,3} `and Delphi`]{.dt_plain}

:   Two to three of `Alpha`, `Baker`, and `Delta` must be followed by
    `and Delphi`. One possible result would be
    `Cray, Alpha, and Delphi`. In this case, the comma is placed because
    of its position within the nested bracket groups. (Some older
    versions of CSS enforced comma separation this way, instead of via
    the `#` modifier.)[]{#preface01.xhtml_idm45797092220800 primary=""

First, I want to thank all the technical reviewers of this edition, who
lent their time and expertise to the arduous task of finding out all the
places I'd been wrong, and for less recompense than they deserved.
Alphabetically, by family name: Ire Aderinokun, Rachel Andrew, Adam
Argyle, Amelia Bellamy-Royds, Chen Hui Jing, Stephanie Eckles, Eva
[Ferreira,]{.keep-together} Mandy Michael, Schalk Neethling, Jason
Pamental, Janelle Pizarro, Eric Portis, Miriam Suzanne, Lea Verou, and
Dan Wilson. Any errors are my fault, not theirs.

Thank you as well to all the technical reviewers of past editions, who
are too many to name here, and all the people who have helped me
understand various bits and bobs of CSS over the years, who are also far
too many to name here. If you ever explained some CSS to me, please
write your name in the following blank:
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, you have my gratitude.

Thank you to all the members of the CSS Working Group, past and present,
who have shepherded an amazing language to astonishing heights...even as
your work means we'll face a real production dilemma for the next
edition of this book, which is already pushing the limits of what
printing technology can reasonably manage.

Thank you to all the people who keep the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)
up and running as well as up-to-date.

Special thanks to all the fine people at Open Web Docs for your work on
MDN, and for asking me to serve as a member of your steering committee.

To my coauthor, Estelle, thank you for all your contributions,
expertise, and pushes to do what was needed.

To all the assorted friends, colleagues, coworkers, acquaintances, and
passersby who have allowed space for my odd enthusiasms and strange
demeanor, thank you for your understanding, patience, and kindness.

And as ever, my boundless gratitude to my family---my wife, Kat, and my
children, Carolyn, Rebecca *z''l*, and Joshua. You are the home that
shelters me, the suns in my sky, and the stars by which I steer. Thank
you for everything you have taught me.

I would like to acknowledge everyone who has worked to make CSS what it
is today and all those who have helped improve diversity and inclusion
in tech.

Many people work tirelessly with browser vendors and developers in
writing the CSS specifications. Without the members of the CSS Working
Group---past, current, and future---we would have no specifications, no
standards, and no cross-browser [compatibility.]{.keep-together} I am in
awe of the thought process that goes into every CSS property and value
added to, and omitted from, the specification. People like Tab Atkins,
Elika Etimad, Dave Baron, Léonie Watson, and Greg Whitworth not only
work on the specification, but also take their time to answer questions
and explain nuances to the broader CSS public, notably me.

I also acknowledge all those who, whether they participate in the CSS
Working Group or not, dive deep into CSS features and help translate the
spec for the rest of us, including Sarah Drasner, Val Head, Sara
Souidan, Chris Coyier, Jen Simmons, and Rachel Andrew. In addition, I
thank the people who create tools that make all CSS developers' lives
easier, especially Alexis Deveria for creating and maintaining the [Can
I Use tool](https://caniuse.com).

I also appreciate all those who have contributed their time and effort
to improve diversity and inclusion in all sectors of the developer
community. Yes, CSS is awesome. But it's important to work with great
people in a great community.

When I attended my first tech conference in 2007, the lineup was 93%
male and 100% white. The audience had slightly less gender diversity and
only slightly more ethnic diversity. I had picked that conference
because the lineup was more diverse than most: it actually had a woman
on it. Looking around the room, I knew things needed to change, and I
realized it was something I needed to do. What I didn't realize then was
how many unsung heroes I would meet over the next 10 years working for
diversity and inclusion in all areas of the tech sector and life in
general.

There are too many people---who work tirelessly, quietly, and often with
little or no recognition---to name them all, but I would like to
highlight some. I cannot express how much of a positive impact people
like Erica Stanley of Women Who Code Atlanta, Carina Zona of Callback
Women, and Jenn Mei Wu of Oakland Maker Space have had. Groups like The
Last Mile, Black Girls Code, Girls Incorporated, Sisters Code, and so
many others inspired me to create a [Feeding the Diversity Pipeline
list](http://www.standardista.com/feeding-the-diversity-pipeline) to
help ensure that the path to a career in web development is not only for
those with privilege.

Thank you to all of you. Thank you to everyone. Because of your efforts,
more has been done than I ever could have imagined sitting in that
conference 10 years ago.

*Cascading Style Sheets* (*CSS*), a []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_css_ch1
primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)" data-type="indexterm"}powerful
programming language that transforms the presentation of a document or a
collection of documents, has spread to nearly every corner of the web as
well as many ostensibly nonweb environments. For example,
embedded-device displays often use CSS to style their user interfaces,
many RSS clients let you apply CSS to feeds and feed entries, and some
instant message clients use CSS to format chat windows. Aspects of CSS
can be found in the syntax used by JavaScript (JS) frameworks and even
in JS itself. It's everywhere!

[]{#ch01.xhtml_ix_css_history_ch1 primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)"
secondary="historical development" data-type="indexterm"}was first
proposed in 1994, just as the web was beginning to really catch on. At
the time, browsers gave all sorts of styling power to the user---the
presentation preferences in NCSA Mosaic, for example, permitted the user
to define each element's font family, size, and color. None of this was
available to document authors; all they could do was mark a piece of
content as a paragraph, as a heading of some level, as preformatted
text, or one of a dozen other element types. If a user configured their
browser to make all level-one headings tiny and pink and all level-six
headings huge and red, well, that was their [lookout.]{.keep-together}

It was into this milieu that CSS was introduced. Its goal was to provide
a simple, declarative styling language that was flexible for web page
authors and, most importantly, provided styling power to authors and
users alike. By means of the *cascade*, these styles could be combined
and prioritized so that both site authors and readers had a say---though
readers always had the last say.

Work []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088347488 primary="CSS1 specification"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797114410416
primary="CSS2 specification" data-type="indexterm"}quickly advanced, and
by late 1996, CSS1 was finished. While the newly established
[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797114409616 primary="CSS Working Group"
data-type="indexterm"}CSS Working Group moved forward with CSS2,
browsers struggled to implement CSS1 in an interoperable way. Although
each piece of CSS was fairly simple on its own, the combination of those
pieces created some surprisingly complex behaviors. Unfortunate missteps
also occurred, such as the infamous discrepancy in box model
implementations. These problems threatened to derail CSS altogether, but
fortunately some clever proposals were implemented, and browsers began
to harmonize. Within a few years, thanks to increasing interoperability
and high-profile developments such as the CSS-based redesign of *Wired*
magazine and the CSS Zen Garden, CSS began to catch on.

Before []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797114408016 primary="CSS3"
data-type="indexterm"}all that happened, though, the CSS Working Group
had finalized the CSS2 specification in early 1998. Once CSS2 was
finished, work immediately began on CSS3, as well as a clarified version
of CSS2 called CSS2.1. In keeping with the spirit of the times, what was
initially coined *CSS3* was constructed as a series of (theoretically)
standalone modules instead of a single monolithic specification. This
approach reflected the then-active XHTML specification, which was split
into modules for similar reasons.

The rationale for modularizing CSS was that each module could be worked
on at its own pace, and particularly critical (or popular) modules could
be advanced along the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C's) progress track
without being held up by others. Indeed, this has turned out to be the
case. By early 2012, three CSS Level 3 modules (along with CSS1 and CSS
2.1) had reached full Recommendation status---CSS Color Level 3, CSS
Namespaces, and Selectors Level 3. At that same time, seven modules were
at Candidate Recommendation status, and several dozen others were in
various stages of Working Draft-ness. Under the old approach, colors,
selectors, and namespaces would have had to wait for every other part of
the specification to be done or cut before they could be part of a
completed specification. Thanks to modularization, they didn't have to
wait.

So while we can't really point to a single tome and say, "This is CSS,"
we can talk of features by the module name under which they are
introduced. The flexibility permitted by modules more than makes up for
the semantic awkwardness they sometimes create. (If you want something
approximating a single monolithic specification, the CSS Working Group
publishes yearly "Snapshot" documents.)

With that established, we're ready to start understanding CSS. Let's
start by covering the basics of what goes inside a
stylesheet.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088596832 primary=""
startref="ix_css_history_ch1" data-type="indexterm"}

::::::::::::::: {#ch01.xhtml_style_sheet_contents .sect1}
# Stylesheet Contents {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_15}

Inside a []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088593872 primary="rules"
seealso="at-rules" data-type="indexterm"}stylesheet, you'll find a
number of *rules* that look a little something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: maroon;}
body {background: yellow;}
```

Styles such as these make up the bulk of any stylesheet---simple or
complex, short or long. But which parts are which, and what do they
represent?

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Rule Structure" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch01.xhtml_rule_structure .sect2}
## Rule Structure {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_16}

To illustrate the concept of rules in more detail, let's break down the
structure.

Each *rule* has two fundamental parts: the selector and the declaration
block. The declaration block is composed of one or more declarations,
and each declaration is a pairing of a property and a value. Every
stylesheet is made up of a series of these rules.
[Figure 1-1](#ch01.xhtml_the_structure_of_a_rule){data-type="xref"}
shows the parts of a rule.

<figure>
<div id="ch01.xhtml_the_structure_of_a_rule" class="figure">
<img src="./images/image001.png" width="600" height="125"
alt="css5 0101" />
<h6 id="ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_17"><span class="label">Figure 1-1.
</span>The structure of a rule</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The *selector*, []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088377920 primary="selectors"
data-type="indexterm"}shown on the left side of the rule, defines which
piece of the document will be selected for styling. In
[Figure 1-1](#ch01.xhtml_the_structure_of_a_rule){data-type="xref"},
`<h1>` (heading level 1) elements are selected. If the selector were
`p`, then all `<p>` (paragraph) elements would be selected.

The []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797113923472 primary="properties"
seealso="specific properties by name"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797113922112
primary="declaration blocks"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797113921440
primary="declarations"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797113920768 primary="values"
seealso="specific values by name" data-type="indexterm"}right side of
the rule contains the *declaration block*, which is made up of one or
more declarations. Each *declaration* is a combination of a CSS
*property* and a *value* of that property. In
[Figure 1-1](#ch01.xhtml_the_structure_of_a_rule){data-type="xref"}, the
declaration block contains two declarations. The first states that this
rule will cause parts of the document to have a `color` of `red`, and
the second states that part of the document will have a `background` of
`yellow`. So, all of the `<h1>` elements in the document (defined by the
selector) will be styled in red text with a yellow
[background]{.keep-together}.

primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)" secondary="vendor prefixing"
data-type="indexterm"}you'll see pieces of CSS with hyphens and labels
in front of them, like this: `-o-border-image`.
[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088755664
primary="hyphens (-…​-), enclosing vendor prefixes"
data-type="indexterm"}These *vendor prefixes* were a way for browser
vendors to mark properties, values, or other bits of CSS as being
experimental or proprietary (or both). As of early 2023, a few vendor
prefixes are in the wild, with the most common shown in
[Table 1-1](#ch01.xhtml_common_vendor_prefixes){data-type="xref"}.

  Prefix       Vendor
  ------------ --------------------------------------------------------------
  `-epub-`     International Digital Publishing Forum ePub format
  `-moz-`      Gecko-based browsers (e.g., Mozilla Firefox)
  `-ms-`       Microsoft Internet Explorer
  `-o-`        Opera-based browsers
  `-webkit-`   WebKit-based browsers (e.g., Apple Safari and Google Chrome)

  : [Table 1-1. ]{.label}Some common vendor prefixes
  {#common_vendor_prefixes}

As [Table 1-1](#ch01.xhtml_common_vendor_prefixes){data-type="xref"}
indicates, the generally accepted format of a vendor prefix is a hyphen,
a label, and a hyphen, although a few prefixes erroneously omit the
first hyphen.

The uses and abuses of vendor prefixes are long, tortuous, and beyond
the scope of this book. Suffice to say that they started out as a way
for vendors to test out new [features]{.keep-together}, thus helping
speed interoperability without worrying about being locked into legacy
behaviors that were incompatible with other browsers. This avoided a
whole class of problems that nearly strangled CSS in its infancy.
Unfortunately, prefixed properties were then publicly deployed by web
authors and ended up causing a whole new class of problems.

As of early 2023, vendor-prefixed CSS features are nearly nonexistent,
with old prefixed properties and values being slowly but steadily
removed from browser implementations. You'll quite likely never write
prefixed CSS, but you may encounter it in the wild or inherit it in a
legacy codebase. Here's an example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
-webkit-transform-origin: 0 0;
-moz-transform-origin: 0 0;
-o-transform-origin: 0 0;
transform-origin: 0 0;
```

That's saying the same thing four times: once each for the WebKit, Gecko
(Firefox), and Opera browser lines, and then finally the CSS-standard
way. Again, this is no longer necessary. We're including it here only to
give you an idea of what it might look like, should you come across this
in the future.

CSS is basically insensitive to []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088636512
primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)" secondary="whitespace in"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088635568
primary="whitespace" secondary="handling of"
data-type="indexterm"}whitespace between rules, and largely insensitive
to whitespace within rules, although a few exceptions exist.

In general, CSS treats whitespace just like HTML does: any sequence of
whitespace characters is collapsed to a single space for parsing
purposes. Thus, you can format this hypothetical `rainbow` rule in the
following ways,

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rainbow: infrared  red  orange  yellow  green  blue  indigo  violet  ultraviolet;

rainbow:
   infrared  red  orange  yellow  green  blue  indigo  violet  ultraviolet;

rainbow:
   infrared
   red
   orange
   yellow
   green
   blue
   indigo
   violet
   ultraviolet
   ;
```

as well as any other separation patterns you can think up. The only
restriction is that the separating characters be whitespace: an empty
space, a tab, or a newline, alone or in combination, as many as you
like.

Similarly, you can format series of rules with whitespace in any fashion
you like. These are just five examples out of an effectively infinite
number of possibilities:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html{color:black;}
body {background: white;}
p {
  color: gray;}
h2 {
     color : silver ;
   }
ol
   {
      color
         :
      silver
         ;
}
```

As []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797114388912 primary="minified CSS"
data-type="indexterm"}you can see from the first rule, whitespace can be
largely omitted. Indeed, this is usually the case with *minified* CSS,
which is CSS that's had every last possible bit of extraneous whitespace
removed, usually by an automated server-side script of some sort. The
rules after the first two use progressively more extravagant amounts of
whitespace until, in the last rule, pretty much everything that can be
separated onto its own line has been.

All of these approaches are valid, so you should pick the formatting
that makes the most sense---that is, is easiest to read---in your eyes,
and stick with it.

## CSS Comments {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_20}

CSS does allow for []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_slash_forward primary="slashes"
secondary="forward slash"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_ix_for_slash_comments2
primary="forward slash, asterisk (/*…​/*), enclosing CSS comments"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_ix_for_slash_comments
primary="/*…​*/ (forward slash, asterisk), enclosing CSS comments"
data-type="indexterm"}comments. These are very similar to C/C++ comments
in that they are surrounded by /`*` and `*`/:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

Comments can span multiple lines, just as in C++:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* This is a CSS comment, and it
can be several lines long without
any problem whatsoever. */
```

It's important to remember that CSS comments cannot be nested. So, for
example, this would *not* be correct:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* This is a comment, in which we find
 another comment, which is WRONG
   /* Another comment */
 and back to the first comment, which is not a comment.*/
```

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_21}

One way to create "nested" comments accidentally is to temporarily
comment out a large block of a stylesheet that already contains a
comment. Since CSS doesn't permit nested comments, the "outside" comment
will end where the "inside" comment ends.
:::

Unfortunately, there is no "rest of the line" comment pattern such as
`//` or `#` (the latter of which is reserved for ID selectors anyway).
The only comment pattern in CSS is /`*` `*`/. Therefore, if you wish to
place comments on the same line as markup, you need to be careful about
how you place them. For example, this is the correct way to do it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: gray;}   /* This CSS comment is several lines */
h2 {color: silver;} /* long, but since it is alongside */
p {color: white;}   /* actual styles, each line needs to */
pre {color: gray;}  /* be wrapped in comment markers. */
```

Given this example, if each line isn't marked off, most of the
stylesheet will become part of the comment and thus will not work:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: gray;}   /* This CSS comment is several lines
h2 {color: silver;}  long, but since it is not wrapped
p {color: white;}    in comment markers, the last three
pre {color: gray;}   styles are part of the comment. */
```

In this example, only the first rule (`h1 {color: gray;}`) will be
applied to the document. The rest of the rules, as part of the comment,
are ignored by the browser's rendering engine.

## Replaced and Nonreplaced Elements {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_25}

Although CSS depends on elements, not all elements are created equal.
For example, images and paragraphs are not the same type of element. In
CSS, elements generally take two forms: replaced and nonreplaced.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Replaced elements" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch01.xhtml_replaced_elements .sect3}
### Replaced elements {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_26}

*Replaced elements* are used to indicate
[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797101332688 primary="replaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}content that is to be replaced by something not
directly represented in the document. []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797088547936
primary="<img> element" primary-sortas="img element"
data-type="indexterm"}Probably the most familiar HTML example is the
`<img>` element, which is replaced by an image file external to the
document itself. In fact, `<img>` has no actual content, as you can see
in this simple example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<img src="howdy.gif" alt="Hello, friend!">
```

This markup fragment contains only an element name and an attribute. The
element presents nothing unless you point it to external content (in
this case, an image file whose location is given by the `src`
attribute). If you point to a valid image file, the image will be placed
in the document. If not, the browser will either display nothing or will
show a "broken image" placeholder.

Similarly, the `input` element can also be replaced---by a radio button,
checkbox, text input box, or other, depending on its type.

The []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797111846768 primary="nonreplaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}majority of HTML elements are *nonreplaced
elements*. Their content is presented by the user agent (generally a
browser) inside a box generated by the element itself. For example,
`<span>hi there</span>` is a nonreplaced element, and the text "hi
there" will be displayed by the user agent. This is true of paragraphs,
headings, table cells, lists, and almost everything else in HTML.

primary="inline boxes" data-type="indexterm"}default, *inline-level
elements* generate an element box within a line of text and do not break
up the flow of that line. The best inline element example is the `<a>`
element in HTML. Other candidates are `<strong>` and `<em>`. These
elements do not generate a "break" before or after themselves, so they
can appear within the content of another element without disrupting its
display.

```{=html}
</aside>
```
You may have noticed that there are a *lot* of values here, only two of
which we've mentioned: `block` and `inline`. Most of these values are
dealt with elsewhere in the book; for example, `grid` and `inline-grid`
are covered in
[Chapter 12](../Text/ch12.xhtml#grid-layout){data-type="xref"}, and the
table-related values are all covered in
[Chapter 13](../Text/ch13.xhtml#title-table-layout-in-css){data-type="xref"}.

For now, let's concentrate on `block` and `inline`. Consider the
following markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<body>
<p>This is a paragraph with <em>an inline element</em> within it.</p>
</body>
```

Here we have two elements (`<body>` and `<p>`) that are generating block
formatting contexts, and one element (`<em>`) with an inline formatting
context. According to the HTML specification, `<em>` can descend from
`<p>`, but the reverse is not true. Typically, the HTML hierarchy works
out so that inlines descend from blocks, but not the other way around.

CSS, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. You can leave the
markup as it is but change the display roles of the two elements like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {display: inline;}
em {display: block;}
```

This causes the elements to generate a block box inside an inline box.
This is perfectly legal and violates no part of CSS.

While changing the display roles of elements can be useful in HTML
documents, it becomes downright critical for XML documents. An XML
document is unlikely to have any inherent display roles, so it's up to
the author to define them. For example, you might wonder how to lay out
the following snippet of XML:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<book>
 <maintitle>The Victorian Internet</maintitle>
 <subtitle>The Remarkable Story of the Telegraph and the Nineteenth Century's
   On-Line Pioneers</subtitle>
 <author>Tom Standage</author>
 <publisher>Bloomsbury Pub Plc USA</publisher>
 <pubdate>February 25, 2014</pubdate>
 <isbn type="isbn-13">9781620405925</isbn>
 <isbn type="isbn-10">162040592X</isbn>
</book>
```

Since the default value of `display` is `inline`, the content would be
rendered as inline text by default, as illustrated in
[Figure 1-3](#ch01.xhtml_default_display_of_an_xml_document){data-type="xref"}.
This isn't a terribly useful display.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch01.xhtml_default_display_of_an_xml_document" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_33"><span class="label">Figure 1-3.
</span>Default display of an XML document</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You can define the basics of the layout with `display`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
book, maintitle, subtitle, author, isbn {display: block;}
publisher, pubdate {display: inline;}
```

We've now set five of the seven elements to be block and two to be
inline. This means each of the block elements will generate its own
block formatting context, and the two inlines will generate their own
inline formatting contexts.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797108281168 primary=""
startref="ix_display_inline" data-type="indexterm"}

We could take the preceding rules as a starting point, add a few other
styles for greater visual impact, and get the result shown in
[Figure 1-4](#ch01.xhtml_styled_display_of_an_xml_document){data-type="xref"}.

That said, before learning how to write CSS in detail, we need to look
at how to associate CSS with a document. After all, without tying the
two together, there's no way for the CSS to affect the document. We'll
explore this in an HTML setting since it's the most
familiar.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797108302320 primary=""

primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)"
secondary="linking to HTML documents" data-type="indexterm"}mentioned
that HTML documents have an inherent structure, and that's a point worth
repeating. In fact, that's part of the problem with web pages of old:
too many of us forgot that documents are supposed to have an internal
structure, which is altogether different from a visual structure. In our
rush to create the coolest-looking pages on the web, we bent, warped,
and generally ignored the idea that pages should contain information
with some structural meaning.

That structure is an inherent part of the relationship between HTML and
CSS; without it, there couldn't be a relationship at all. To understand
it better, let's look at an example HTML document and break it down by
pieces:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
<head>

  of aromatic ecstasy!

```

result of this markup and the applied styles.

Now, let's examine the various ways this document connects to CSS.

:::::::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="The <link> Tag" data-type="sect2"}
::::::::: {#ch01.xhtml_the_link_tag .sect2}
## The \<link\> Tag {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_37}

First, []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_link_tag primary="<link> tag"
primary-sortas="link tag" secondary="linking CSS to HTML documents"
data-type="indexterm"}consider the use of the `<link>` tag:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="sheet1.css" media="screen, print">
```

The `<link>` tag's basic purpose is to allow HTML authors to associate
other documents with the document containing the `<link>` tag. CSS uses
it to link stylesheets to the [document.]{.keep-together}

These []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797108060096 primary="external stylesheets"
data-type="indexterm"}stylesheets, which are not part of the HTML
document but are still used by it, are referred to as *external
stylesheets*. This is because they're stylesheets that are external to
the HTML document. (Go figure.)

To successfully load an external stylesheet, `<link>` should be placed
inside the `<head>` element, though it can also appear inside the
`<body>` element. This will cause the web browser to locate and load the
stylesheet and use whatever styles it contains to render the HTML
document;
[Figure 1-6](#ch01.xhtml_a_representation_of_how_external_style){data-type="xref"}
depicts the stylesheet called *sheet1.css* being linked to the document.

Also shown in
[Figure 1-6](#ch01.xhtml_a_representation_of_how_external_style){data-type="xref"}
is the loading of the external *sheet2.css* via an `@import`
declaration. Imports must be placed at the beginning of the stylesheet
that contains them.

</span>A representation of how external stylesheets are applied to
documents</h6>
</div>
</figure>

And []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_rules_css_html primary="rules"
data-type="indexterm"}what is the format of an external stylesheet? It's
a list of rules, just like those you saw in the previous section and in
the example HTML document; but in this case, the rules are saved into
their own file. Just remember that no HTML or any other markup language
can be included in the stylesheet---only style rules. Here are the
contents of an [external stylesheet:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: red;}
h2 {color: maroon; background-color: white;}
h3 {color: white; background-color: black;
  font: medium Helvetica;}
```

That's all there is to it---no HTML markup or comments at all, just
plain-and-simple style declarations. These are saved into a plain-text
file and are usually given an extension of *.css*, as in
*sheet1.css*.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097220016 primary=""
startref="ix_link_tag" data-type="indexterm"}

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_39}

An external stylesheet cannot contain any document markup at all, only
CSS rules and CSS comments. The presence of markup in an external
stylesheet can cause some or all of it to be ignored.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Attributes" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch01.xhtml_attributes .sect3}
### Attributes {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_40}

For []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_attrib_HTML primary="attributes"
secondary="external stylesheet linking to HTML"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097184688
primary="rel attribute (HTML)" data-type="indexterm"}the rest of the
`<link>` tag, the attributes and values are fairly straightforward. The
`rel` attribute stands for *relation*, and in this case, the relation is
`stylesheet`. Note that the `rel` attribute is *required*. CSS has an
optional `type` attribute whose default value is `text/css`, so you can
include `type="text/css"` or leave it out, whichever you prefer.

These attribute values describe the relationship and type of data that
will be loaded using the `<link>` tag. That way, the web browser knows
that the stylesheet is a CSS stylesheet, a fact that will determine how
the browser will deal with the data it imports. (Other style languages
may be used in the future. In such a future, if you are using a
different style language, the `type` attribute will need to be
declared.)

Next, we find the `href` attribute. []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097178048
primary="href attribute" data-type="indexterm"}The value of this
attribute is the URL of your stylesheet. This URL can be either absolute
or relative---that is, either relative to the URL of the document
containing the URL, or else a complete URL that points to a unique
location on the web. In our example, the URL is relative. It could have
been something absolute, like
*[*http://example.com/sheet1.css*](http://example.com/sheet1.css){.bare}*.

Finally, we have a `media` attribute. []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097174672
primary="<link> tag" primary-sortas="link tag"
secondary="media attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097173392
primary="media attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097172720
primary="media queries (@media)" secondary="media attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097171776
primary=", (comma)" secondary="separating attribute values"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097170864
primary="comma (,)" secondary="separating attribute values"
data-type="indexterm"}The value of this attribute is one or more *media
descriptors*, which are rules regarding media types and the features of
those media, with each rule separated by a comma. Thus, for example, you
can use a linked stylesheet in both screen and print media:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="visual-sheet.css" media="screen, print">
```

Media descriptors can get quite complicated and are explained in detail
in [Chapter 21](../Text/ch21.xhtml#css-at-rules){data-type="xref"}. For
now, we'll stick with the basic media types shown.
[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797097156704 primary="all media type"
data-type="indexterm"}The default value is `all`, which means the CSS
will be applied in all media.

Note that more than one linked stylesheet can be associated with a
document. In these cases, only those `<link>` tags with a `rel` of
`stylesheet` will be used in the initial display of the document. Thus,
if you wanted to link two stylesheets named *basic.css* and
*splash.css*, it would look like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="basic.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="splash.css">
```

This will cause the browser to load both stylesheets, combine the rules
from each, and apply them all to the document in all media types
(because the `media` attribute is omitted, its default value `all` is
used). For example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="basic.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="splash.css">

<p class="a1">This paragraph will be gray only if styles from the
stylesheet 'basic.css' are applied.</p>
<p class="b1">This paragraph will be gray only if styles from the
stylesheet 'splash.css' are applied.</p>
```

The one attribute that isn't in this example markup, but could be, is
`title`. This attribute is not often used but could become important in
the future and, if used improperly, can have unexpected effects. Why?
We'll explore that in the next section.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797096987008
primary="" startref="ix_attrib_HTML" data-type="indexterm"}
:::
::::

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Alternate stylesheets" data-type="sect3"}
:::: {#ch01.xhtml_alternate_style_sheets .sect3}
### Alternate stylesheets {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_41}

It's []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_alt_style primary="alternate stylesheets"
data-type="indexterm"}possible to define *alternate stylesheets* that
users can select in some browsers. These are defined by making the value
of the `rel` attribute `alternate stylesheet`, and they are used in
document presentation only if selected by the user.

Should a []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_title_attrib primary="title attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}browser be able to use alternate stylesheets, it
will use the values of the `<link>` element's `title` attributes to
generate a list of style alternatives. So you could write the following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="sheet1.css" title="Default">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet" href="bigtext.css" title="Big Text">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet" href="zany.css" title="Crazy colors!">
```

Users could then pick the style they want to use, and the browser would
switch from the first one, labeled `Default` in this case, to whichever
the user picked.
[Figure 1-7](#ch01.xhtml_a_browser_offering_alternate_style){data-type="xref"}
shows one way in which this selection mechanism might be accomplished
(and in fact was, early in the resurgence of CSS).

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch01.xhtml_a_browser_offering_alternate_style" class="figure">
<img src="/images/image007.png" width="600" height="206"

</div>
</figure>

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_43}

As of early 2023, alternate stylesheets are supported in most
Gecko-based browsers like Firefox. The Chromium and WebKit families do
not support selecting alternate stylesheets. Compare this to the build
date of the browser shown in
[Figure 1-7](#ch01.xhtml_a_browser_offering_alternate_style){data-type="xref"},
which is late 2002.
:::

It's also possible to group alternate stylesheets together by giving
them the same `title` value. Thus, you make it possible for the user to
pick a different presentation for your site in both screen and print
media:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet"
   href="sheet1.css" title="Default" media="screen">
<link rel="stylesheet"
   href="print-sheet1.css" title="Default" media="print">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet"
   href="bigtext.css" title="Big Text" media="screen">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet"
   href="print-bigtext.css" title="Big Text" media="print">
```

If a user selects Big Text from the alternate stylesheet selection
mechanism in a conforming user agent, *bigtext.css* will be used to
style the document in the screen medium, and *print-bigtext.css* will be
used in the print medium. Neither *sheet1.css* nor *print-sheet1.css*
will be used in any medium.

Why is that? []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104839632
primary="preferred stylesheet" data-type="indexterm"}Because if you give
a `<link>` with a `rel` of `stylesheet` a title, you are designating
that stylesheet as a *preferred stylesheet*. Its use is preferred to
alternate stylesheets, and it will be used when the document is first
displayed. Once you select an alternate stylesheet, however, the
preferred stylesheet will *not* be used.

Furthermore, if you designate a number of stylesheets as preferred, all
but one of them will be ignored. Consider the following code example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet"
   href="sheet1.css" title="Default Layout">
<link rel="stylesheet"
   href="sheet2.css" title="Default Text Sizes">
<link rel="stylesheet"
   href="sheet3.css" title="Default Colors">
```

All three `<link>` elements now refer to preferred stylesheets, thanks
to the presence of a `title` attribute on all three, but only one of
them will actually be used in that manner. The other two will be ignored
completely. Which two? There's no way to be certain, as HTML doesn't
provide a method of determining which preferred stylesheets should be
ignored and which should be used.

If you don't give a stylesheet a title, it becomes a *persistent
stylesheet* and is always used in the display of the document. Often,
this is exactly what an author wants, especially since alternate
stylesheets are not widely supported and are almost completely unknown
[to users]{.keep-together}.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104772768 primary=""

## The \<style\> Element {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_44}

The `<style>` element is one way to include a
[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104768736 primary="<style> element"
primary-sortas="style element" secondary="linking CSS to HTML documents"
data-type="indexterm"}stylesheet, and it appears in the document itself:

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104730560
primary="embedded stylesheet" data-type="indexterm"}styles between the
opening and closing `<style>` tags are referred to as the *document
stylesheet* or the *embedded stylesheet* (because this kind of
stylesheet is embedded within the document). It contains styles that
apply to the document, but it can also contain multiple links to
external stylesheets via the `@import` directive, discussed in the next
section.

You can give `<style>` elements a `media` attribute, which functions in
the same manner as it does on linked stylesheets. This, for example,
will restrict an embedded stylesheet's rules to be applied in print
media only:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<style media="print">…</style>
```

You can also label an embedded stylesheet with a `<title>` element, in
the same manner and for the same reasons discussed in the previous
section on alternate stylesheets.

As with the `<link>` element, the `<style>` element can use the
attribute `type`; in the case of a CSS document, the correct value is
`"text/css"`. The `type` attribute is optional in HTML as long as you're
loading CSS, because the default value for the `type` attribute on the
`<style>` element is `text/css`. It would be necessary to explicitly
declare a `type` value only if you were using some other styling
language, perhaps in a future where such a thing is supported. For the
time being, though, the attribute remains wholly
optional.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104690576 primary=""

:::: {#ch01.xhtml_the_at_import_directive .sect2}
## The \@import Directive {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_45}

Now we'll []{#ch01.xhtml_ix_import_rule primary="@import rule"
primary-sortas="import rule"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch01.xhtml_ix_atrule_import primary="at-rules"
secondary="@import" secondary-sortas="import"
data-type="indexterm"}discuss the stuff that is found inside the
`<style>` tag. First, we have something very similar to `<link>`, the
`@import` directive:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(sheet2.css);
```

Just like `<link>`, `@import` can be used to direct the web browser to
load an external stylesheet and use its styles in the rendering of the
HTML document. The only major difference is in the syntax and placement
of the command. As you can see, `@import` is found inside the `<style>`
element. It must be placed first, before the other CSS rules, or it
won't work at all. Consider this example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<style>
@import url(styles.css); /* @import comes first */
h1 {color: gray;}
</style>
```

As with `<link>`, a document can have more than one `@import` statement.
Unlike `<link>`, however, the stylesheets of every `@import` directive
will be loaded and used; there is no way to designate alternate
stylesheets with `@import`. So, given the following markup:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(sheet2.css);
@import url(blueworld.css);
@import url(zany.css);
```

...all three external stylesheets will be loaded, and all of their style
rules will be used in the display of the document.

As with `<link>`, you can restrict imported stylesheets to one or more
media by providing media descriptors after the stylesheet's URL:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(sheet2.css) all;
@import url(blueworld.css) screen;
@import url(zany.css) screen, print;
```

As noted in ["The \<link\>
Tag"](#ch01.xhtml_the_link_tag){data-type="xref"}, media descriptors can
get quite complicated and are explained in detail in
[Chapter 21](../Text/ch21.xhtml#css-at-rules){data-type="xref"}.

The `@import` directive can be highly useful if you have an external
stylesheet that needs to use the styles found in other external
stylesheets. Since external stylesheets cannot contain any document
markup, the `<link>` element can't be used---but `@import` can.
Therefore, you might have an external stylesheet that contains the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(http://example.org/library/layout.css);
@import url(basic-text.css);
@import url(printer.css) print;
body {color: red;}
h1 {color: blue;}
```

Well, maybe not those exact styles, but hopefully you get the idea. Note
the use of both absolute and relative URLs in the previous example.
Either URL form can be used, just as with `<link>`.

Note also that the `@import` directives appear at the beginning of the
stylesheet, as they did in the example document. As we said previously,
CSS requires the `@import` directives to come before any rules in a
stylesheet, though they can be preceded by `@charset` and `@layer`
declarations. An `@import` that comes after other rules (e.g.,
`body {color`: `red;}`) will be ignored by conforming user agents.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_46}

Some versions of Internet Explorer for Windows did not ignore any
`@import` directive, even those that come after other rules, but all
modern browsers do ignore improperly placed `@import`
[directives.]{.keep-together}
:::

Another []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104519328 primary="cascade layer"
data-type="indexterm"}descriptor that can be added to an `@import`
directive is a *cascade layer* identifier. This assigns all of the
styles in the imported stylesheet to a cascade layer, which is a concept
we'll explore in
[Chapter 4](../Text/ch04.xhtml#specificity_comma_inheritance){data-type="xref"}.
It looks like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(basic-text.css) screen layer(basic);
```

That assigns the styles from *basic-text.css* to the `basic` cascade
layer. If you want to assign the styles to an unnamed layer, use `layer`
without the parenthetical naming, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(basic-text.css) screen layer;
```

Note that this ability is a difference between `@import` and `<link>`,
as the latter cannot be labeled with a cascade
layer.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104513184 primary=""

In []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104483952
primary="HTTP headers, linking CSS to HTML documents"
data-type="indexterm"}another, far more obscure way to associate CSS
with a document, you can link the two via HTTP headers.

Under []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797104482496 primary=".htaccess file"
primary-sortas="htaccess file" data-type="indexterm"}Apache HTTP Server,
this can be accomplished by adding a reference to the CSS file in a
*.htaccess* file. For example:

``` {code-language="apache" data-type="programlisting"}
Header add Link "</ui/testing.css>;rel=stylesheet;type=text/css"
```

This will cause supporting browsers to associate the referenced
stylesheet with any documents served from under that *.htaccess* file.
The browser will then treat it as if it were a linked stylesheet.
Alternatively, and probably more efficiently, you can add an equivalent
rule to the server's *httpd.conf* file:

``` {code-language="apache" data-type="programlisting"}
<Directory /path/to/ /public/html/directory>
Header add Link "</ui/testing.css>;rel=stylesheet;type=text/css"
</Directory>
```

The effect is exactly the same in supporting browsers. The only
difference is in where you declare the linking.

You probably noticed the use of the term "supporting browsers." As of
late 2022, the widely used browsers that support HTTP linking of
stylesheets are the Firefox family and Opera. That restricts this
technique mostly to development environments based on one of those
browsers. In such a situation, you can use HTTP linking on the test
server to mark when you're on the development site as opposed to the
public site. It's also an interesting way to hide styles from Chromium
browsers, assuming you have a reason to do so.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch01.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_48}

Equivalents to this linking technique are used in common scripting
languages such as PHP and IIS, both of which allow the author to emit
HTTP headers. It's also possible to use such languages to explicitly
write `link` elements into the document based on the server offering up
the document. This is a more robust approach in terms of browser
support: every browser supports the `link` [element.]{.keep-together}

The syntax of a `style` attribute is fairly ordinary. In fact, it looks
very much like the declarations found in the `<style>` container, except
here the curly braces are replaced by double quotation marks. So
`<p style="color`: `maroon; background`: `yellow;">` will set the text
color to be maroon and the background to be yellow *for that paragraph
only*. No other part of the document will be affected by this
declaration.

Note []{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797092755696 primary="rules"
secondary="declarations" data-type="indexterm"}that you can place only a
declaration block, not an entire stylesheet, inside an inline `style`
attribute. Therefore, you can't put an `@import` into a `style`
attribute, nor can you include any complete rules. The only thing you
can put into the value of a `style` attribute is what might go between
the curly braces of a rule.

Use of the `style` attribute is discouraged. Many of the primary
advantages of CSS---the ability to organize centralized styles that
control an entire document's appearance or the appearance of all
documents on a web server---are negated when you place styles into a
`style` attribute. In many ways, inline styles are not much better than
the ancient `<font>` tag, even if they do have a good deal more
flexibility in terms of which visual effects they can
apply.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797092751088 primary=""

With CSS, you can completely change the way elements are presented by a
user agent. You can do this at a basic level with the `display`
property, and in a different way by associating stylesheets with a
document. The user will never know whether this is done via an external
or embedded stylesheet, or even with an inline style. The real
importance of external stylesheets is the way in which they allow you to
put all of a site's presentation information in one place, and point all
of the documents to that place. This not only makes site updates and
maintenance a breeze, but also helps to save bandwidth, since all of the
presentation is removed from documents.[]{#ch01.xhtml_idm45797092747184
primary="" startref="ix_css_ch1" data-type="indexterm"}

To make the most of the power of CSS, you need to know how to associate
a set of styles with the elements in a document. To fully understand how
CSS can do all of this, you need a firm grasp of the way CSS selects
pieces of a document for styling, which is the subject of the next few
chapters.

One of the []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_selector_ch2 primary="selectors"
data-type="indexterm"}primary advantages of CSS is its ability to easily
apply a set of styles to all elements of the same type. Unimpressed?
Consider this: by editing a single line of CSS, you can change the
colors of all your headings. Don't like the blue you're using? Change
that one line of code, and they can all be purple, yellow, maroon, or
any other color you desire.

This capability lets you, the author, focus on design and user
experience rather than tedious find-and-replace operations. The next
time you're in a meeting and someone wants to see headings with a
different shade of green, just edit your style and hit Reload. Voilà!
The results are accomplished in seconds and there for everyone to see.

As []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092698016
primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)" secondary="basic style rules"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092697040 primary="rules"
data-type="indexterm"}stated, a central feature of CSS is its ability to
apply certain rules to an entire set of element types in a document. For
example, let's say that you want to make the text of all `<h2>` elements
appear gray. Before we had CSS, you'd have to do this by inserting
`<font color="gray">...</font>` tags inside all your `<h2>` elements.
Applying inline styles using the `style` attribute, which is also bad
practice, would require you to include `style="color: gray;"` in all
your `<h2>` elements, like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h2 style="color: gray;">This is h2 text</h2>
```

This will be a tedious process if your document contains a lot of `<h2>`
elements. Worse, if you later decide that you want all those `<h2>`s to
be green instead of gray, you'd have to start the manual tagging all
over again. (Yes, this is really how it used to be done!)

CSS allows you to create rules that are simple to change, edit, and
apply to all the text elements you define (the next section explains how
these rules work). For example, you can write this rule once to make all
your `<h2>` elements gray:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {color: gray;}
```

primary="element (type) selectors" data-type="indexterm"}known as an
*element selector*, is most often an HTML element, but not always. For
example, if a CSS file contains styles for an XML document, the type
selectors might look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
quote {color: gray;}
bib {color: red;}
booktitle {color: purple;}
myElement {color: red;}
```

In other words, the elements of the document are the node types being
selected. In XML, a []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092571648 primary="XML"
secondary="type selectors for" data-type="indexterm"}selector could be
anything because XML allows for the creation of new markup languages
that can have just about anything as an element name. If you're styling
an HTML document, the selector will generally be one of the many defined
HTML elements such as `<p>`, `<h3>`, `<em>`, `<a>`, or even `<html>`
itself. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html {color: black;}
h1 {color: gray;}
h2 {color: silver;}
```

paragraph text, not the `<h1>` elements, in

# Grouping {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_55}

So far, you've seen fairly simple techniques for applying a single style
to a single selector. But what if you want the same style to apply to
multiple elements? *Grouping* allows an author to drastically compact
certain types of style assignments, which makes for a shorter
stylesheet.

:::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Grouping Selectors" data-type="sect2"}
::::: {#ch02.xhtml_grouping_selectors .sect2}
## Grouping Selectors {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_56}

Let's []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_selector_group primary="selectors"
secondary="grouping of"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_ix_group_select
primary="grouping of selectors" data-type="indexterm"}say you want both
`<h2>` elements and paragraphs to have gray text. The easiest way to
accomplish this is to use the following declaration:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2, p {color: gray;}
```

By []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092490000 primary="comma (,)"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092457824
primary="curly braces ({…​})" secondary="grouping selectors"
data-type="indexterm"}placing the `h2` and `p` selectors at the
beginning of the rule, before the opening curly brace, and separating
them with a comma, you've defined a rule indicating that the style
inside the curly braces (`color: gray;`) applies to the elements
referenced by both selectors. The comma tells the browser that two
different selectors are involved in the rule. Leaving out the comma
would give the rule a completely different meaning, which we'll explore
in ["Defining Descendant
Selectors"](#ch02.xhtml_descendant_selectors){data-type="xref"}.

These []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092454352 primary="values"
secondary="specifying multiple" data-type="indexterm"}alternatives
produce exactly the same result, but one is a lot easier to type:

h3 {color: purple;}
h4 {color: purple;}
h5 {color: purple;}
h6 {color: purple;}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {color: purple;}
```

The second alternative, with one grouped selector, is also a lot easier
to maintain [over time.]{.keep-together}

### The universal selector {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_57}

The *universal selector*, []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092389568
primary="* (asterisk)" secondary="universal selector"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092388560

primary="universal selector (*)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797092386944
primary="selectors" secondary="universal"
data-type="indexterm"}displayed as an asterisk (`*`), matches any
element at all, much like a wildcard. For example, to make every single
element in a document bold, you would write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
* {font-weight: bold;}
```

This declaration is equivalent to a grouped selector that lists every
element contained within the document. The universal selector lets you
assign the `font-weight` value `bold` to every element in the document
in one efficient stroke. Beware, however: although the universal
selector is convenient because it targets everything within its
declaration scope, it can have unintended consequences, which are
discussed in ["Zeroed Selector
Specificity"](../Text/ch04.xhtml#zeroed_selector_specificity){data-type="xref"}.

## Grouping Declarations {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_58}

Just as you can []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_rules_declar primary="rules"
secondary="declarations"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_ix_group_declar
primary="grouping of declarations"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_ix_decl_group
primary="declarations" secondary="grouping of"
data-type="indexterm"}group selectors into a single rule, you can also
group declarations. Assuming that you want all `<h1>` elements to appear
in purple, 18-pixel-high Helvetica text on an aqua background (and you
don't mind blinding your readers), you could write your styles like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font: 18px Helvetica;}
h1 {color: purple;}
h1 {background: aqua;}
```

But this method is inefficient---imagine creating such a list for an
element that will carry 10 or 15 styles! Instead, you can group your
declarations together:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font: 18px Helvetica; color: purple; background: aqua;}
```

This will have exactly the same effect as the three-line stylesheet just
shown.

Note []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797094611680 primary="whitespace"
secondary="separating value keywords"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797094610832
primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)" secondary="whitespace in"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797094609920
primary="; (semicolon), in rules"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797094581648
primary="semicolon (;), in rules" data-type="indexterm"}that using
semicolons at the end of each declaration is crucial when you're
grouping them. Browsers ignore whitespace in stylesheets, so the user
agent must rely on correct syntax to parse the stylesheet. You can
fearlessly format styles like the [following]{.keep-together}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {
  font: 18px Helvetica;
  color: purple;
  background: aqua;
}
```

You can also minimize your CSS, removing all unrequired spaces:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1{font:18px Helvetica;color:purple;background:aqua;}
```

The last three examples are treated equally by the server, but the
second one is generally regarded as the most human-readable, and is the
recommended method of writing your CSS during development. You might
choose to minimize your CSS for network-performance reasons, but this is
usually automatically handled by a build tool, server-side script,
caching network, or other service, so you're usually better off writing
your CSS in a human-readable fashion.

If the []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797094510640
primary="; (semicolon), in rules"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797094510144
primary="semicolon (;), in rules" data-type="indexterm"}semicolon is
omitted on the second statement, the user agent will interpret the
stylesheet as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {
  font: 18px Helvetica;
  color: purple background: aqua;
}
```

Because `background:` is not a valid value for `color`, a user agent
will ignore the `color` declaration entirely (including the
`background: aqua` part). You might think the browser would at least
render `<h1>`s as purple text without an aqua background, but not so.
Instead, they will be the inherited color with a transparent background.
The declaration `font: 18px Helvetica` will still take effect since it
was correctly terminated with a semicolon.

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_59}

Although following the last declaration of a rule with a semicolon is
not technically necessary in CSS, doing so is generally good practice.
First, it will keep you in the habit of terminating your declarations
with semicolons, the lack of which is one of the most common causes of
rendering errors. Second, if you decide to add another declaration to a
rule, you won't have to worry about forgetting to insert an extra
semicolon.

As with selector grouping, declaration grouping is a convenient way to
keep your stylesheets short, expressive, and easy to maintain.

## Grouping Everything {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_60}

You now know that you can group selectors and you can group
declarations. By combining both kinds of grouping in single rules, you
can define very complex styles using only a few statements. Now, what if
you want to assign some complex styles to all the headings in a
document, and you want the same styles to be applied to all of them?
Here's how:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {color: gray; background: white; padding: 0.5em;
  border: 1px solid black; font-family: Charcoal, sans-serif;}
```

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797094365520
primary="curly braces ({…​})" secondary="grouping declarations"
data-type="indexterm"}grouped the selectors, so the styles inside the
curly braces will be applied to all the headings listed; grouping the
declarations means that all of the listed styles will be applied to the
selectors on the left side of the rule.
[Figure 2-3](#ch02.xhtml_grouping_both_selectors_and_rules){data-type="xref"}

h2 {color: gray;}
h3 {color: gray;}
h4 {color: gray;}

h1 {background: white;}
h2 {background: white;}
h3 {background: white;}
```

...​and continue for many lines. You *can* write out your styles the long
way, but we don't recommend it---editing them would be about as tedious
as using `style` attributes [everywhere!]{.keep-together}

Grouping allows for some interesting choices.

h2 {color: silver; background: gray;}
h3 {color: white; background: gray;}

So far, we've been grouping selectors and declarations together in a
variety of ways, but the selectors we've been using are very simple ones
that refer only to document elements. Type selectors are fine up to a
point, but oftentimes you need something a little more focused.

In addition to type selectors, CSS has *class selectors* and *ID
selectors*, which let you assign styles based on HTML attributes but
independent of element type. These selectors can be used on their own or
in conjunction with type selectors. However, they work only if you've
marked up your document appropriately, so using them generally involves
a little forethought and planning.

For example, say a document contains multiple warnings. You want each
warning to appear in boldfaced text so that it will stand out. However,
you don't know which element types contain this warning content. Some
warnings could be entire paragraphs, while others could be a single item
within a lengthy list or a few words in a section of text. So, you can't
define a rule using type selectors of any kind. Suppose you tried this
route:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: red;
}
```

*All* paragraphs would be red and bold, not just those that contain
warnings. You need a way to select only the text that contains
warnings---or, more precisely, a way to select only those elements that
are warnings. How do you do it? You apply styles to parts of the
document that have been marked in a certain way, independent of the
elements involved, by using class selectors.

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Class Selectors" data-type="sect2"}

## Class Selectors {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_64}

The []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_class_selector primary="class selectors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_ix_selector_class
primary="selectors" secondary="class" data-type="indexterm"}most common
way to apply styles without worrying about the elements involved is to
use *class selectors*. Before you can use them, however, you need to
modify your document markup so that the class selectors will work. Enter
the `class` attribute:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p class="warning">When handling plutonium, care must be taken to avoid
the formation of a critical mass.</p>
<p>With plutonium, <span class="warning">the possibility of implosion is
very real, and must be avoided at all costs</span>. This can be accomplished
by keeping the various masses separate.</p>
```

To []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797111366176 primary="class attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}associate the styles of a class selector with an
element, you must assign a `class` attribute the appropriate value. In

primary=". (period), in class selectors" data-type="indexterm"}apply
styles to these classed elements, you can use a compact notation in
which the name of the class is preceded by a period (`.`):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*.warning {font-weight: bold;}
```

When combined with the example markup shown earlier, this simple rule
has the effect shown in
[Figure 2-5](#ch02.xhtml_using_a_class_selector){data-type="xref"}. The
declaration `font-weight: bold` will be applied to every element that
carries a `class` attribute with a value of `warning`.

As [Figure 2-5](#ch02.xhtml_using_a_class_selector){data-type="xref"}
illustrates, the class selector works by directly referencing a value
that will be found in the `class` attribute of an element. This
reference is *always* preceded by a period (`.`), which marks it as a
class selector. The period helps keep the class selector separate from
anything with which it might be combined, such as a type selector. For
example, you may want boldfaced warning text only when an entire
paragraph is a warning:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.warning {font-weight: bold;}
```

</span>Using a class selector</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The selector now matches any `<p>` elements that have a `class`
attribute containing the word `warning`, but no other elements of any
kind, classed or otherwise. Since the `<span>` element is not a
paragraph, the rule's selector doesn't match it, and it won't be
displayed using boldfaced text.

If you wanted to assign different styles to the `<span>` element, you
could use the selector `span.warning`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.warning {font-weight: bold;}
span.warning {font-style: italic;}
```

In this case, the warning paragraph is boldfaced, while the warning
`<span>` is italicized. Each rule applies only to a specific type of
element/class combination, so it does not leak over to other elements.

Another option is to use a combination of a general class selector and
an element-specific class selector to make the styles even more useful,
as in the following markup:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.warning {font-style: italic;}
span.warning {font-weight: bold;}
```

[Figure 2-6](#ch02.xhtml_using_generic_and_specific_selectors_to){data-type="xref"}
shows the results.

In this situation, any warning text will be italicized, but only the
text within a `<span>` element with a `class` of `warning` will be both
boldfaced and italicized.

primary="* (asterisk)" secondary="universal selector"
data-type="indexterm"}format of the general class selector used in the
previous example: it's a class name preceded by a period, and without an
element name or universal selector. If you want to select all elements
that share a class name, you can omit the universal selector from a
class selector without any ill effects. Thus, `*.warning` and `.warning`
will have exactly the same effect.[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797111193280

:::

Another thing about class names: they should *never* begin with a
number. Browsers will allow you to get away with this, but CSS
validators will complain, and it's a bad habit to get into. Thus, you
should write `.c8675` in your CSS and `class="c8675"` in your HTML,
rather than `.8675` and `class="8675"`. If you must refer to classes
that begin with numbers, put a backslash between the period and the
first number in your class selector, like so: `.\8675`.

## Multiple Classes {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_68}

In the []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_multi_class_selector
primary="multiple class selectors" data-type="indexterm"}previous
section, we dealt with `class` values that contain a single word.
[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797111185072 primary="HTML"
secondary="multiple selector values versus CSS" data-type="indexterm"}In
HTML, it's possible to have a space-separated list of words in a single
`class` value. For example, if you want to mark a particular element as
being both urgent and a warning, you could write this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p class="urgent warning">When handling plutonium, care must be taken to
avoid the formation of a critical mass.</p>
<p>With plutonium, <span class="warning">the possibility of implosion is
very real, and must be avoided at all costs</span>. This can be accomplished
by keeping the various masses separate.</p>
```

The []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797111156720 primary="case sensitivity"
secondary="class selectors" data-type="indexterm"}order of the words
doesn't matter; `warning urgent` would also work and would yield
precisely the same results no matter how your CSS is written. Unlike
HTML tags and type selectors, class selectors are case-sensitive.

Now let's say you want all elements with a `class` of `warning` to be
boldfaced, those with a `class` of `urgent` to be italic, and those
elements with both values to have a silver background. This would be
written as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.warning {font-weight: bold;}
.urgent {font-style: italic;}
.warning.urgent {background: silver;}
```

By []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797111129040 primary="chaining"
data-type="indexterm"}chaining two class selectors together, you can
select only those elements that have both class names, in any order. As
you can see, the HTML source contains `class="urgent warning"`, but the
CSS selector is written `.warning.urgent`. Regardless, the rule will
still cause the "When handling plutonium... " paragraph to have a silver
background, as illustrated in
[Figure 2-7](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_elements_with_multiple_class_n){data-type="xref"}.
This happens because the order in which the words are written in the
source document, or in the CSS, doesn't matter. (This is not to say the
order of classes is always irrelevant, but we'll get to that later in
the chapter.)

If a multiple class selector contains a name that is not in the
space-separated list, the match will fail. Consider the following rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.warning.help {background: red;}
```

As you might expect, the selector will match only those `<p>` elements
with a `class` containing the space-separated words `warning` and
`help`. Therefore, it will not match a `<p>` element with just the words
`warning` and `urgent` in its `class` attribute. It would, however,
match the following:[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797109116272 primary=""

primary="# (octothorpe)" secondary="in ID selectors"
secondary-sortas="ID selectors" data-type="indexterm"}some ways, *ID
selectors* are similar to class selectors, but a few crucial differences
exist. First, ID selectors are preceded by a hash sign (`#`)---formally
called an octothorpe and also known as a pound sign (in the United
States), number sign, or tic-tac-toe board---instead of a period. Thus,
you might see a rule like this one:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*#first-para {font-weight: bold;}
```

This []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797109026912 primary="id attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}rule produces boldfaced text in any element whose
`id` attribute has a value of [`first-para`.]{.keep-together}

The second difference is that instead of referencing values of the
`class` attribute, ID selectors refer, sensibly enough, to values found
in `id` attributes. Here's an example of an ID selector in action:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*#lead-para {font-weight: bold;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p id="lead-para">This paragraph will be boldfaced.</p>
<p>This paragraph will NOT be bold.</p>
```

Note that the value `lead-para` could have been assigned to any element
within the document. In this particular case, it is applied to the first
paragraph, but we could have applied it just as easily to the second or
third paragraph. Or an unordered list. Or anything.

The third difference is that a document should have only one instance of
a given ID value. If you find yourself wanting to apply the same ID to
multiple elements in a document, make it a class instead.

As with []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108947536 primary="selectors"
secondary="universal"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108946560
primary="universal selector (*)" secondary="class selector and"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108945616
primary="* (asterisk)" secondary="universal selector"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108944672
primary="asterisk (*)" secondary="universal selector"
data-type="indexterm"}class selectors, it is possible (and very much the
norm) to omit the universal selector from an ID selector. In the
previous example, we could also have written this with the exact same
effect:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#lead-para {font-weight: bold;}
```

This is useful when you know that a certain ID value will appear in a
document, but you don't know the element type on which it will appear.
For example, you may know that in any given document, there will be an
element with an ID value of `mostImportant`. You don't know whether that
most important thing will be a paragraph, a short phrase, a list item,
or a section heading. You know only that it will exist in each document,
occur in an arbitrary element, and appear no more than once. In that
case, you would write a rule like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#mostImportant {color: red; background: yellow;}
```

This rule would match any of the following elements (which, as noted
before, should *not* appear together in the same document because they
all have the same ID value):

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1 id="mostImportant">This is important!</h1>
<em id="mostImportant">This is important!</em>
<ul id="mostImportant">This is important!</ul>
```

While HTML standards say each `id` must be unique in a document, CSS
doesn't care. If we had erroneously included the HTML shown just now,
all three would likely be red with a yellow background because all three
match the `#mostImportant` selector.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_71}

As with class names, IDs should never start with numbers. If you must
refer to an ID that begins with a number and cannot change the ID value
in the markup, use a backslash before the first number, as in `#\309`.

secondary="class" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108832736
primary="class selectors" data-type="indexterm"}assign classes to any
number of elements, as demonstrated earlier; the class name `warning`
was applied to both a `<p>` and a `<span>` element, and it could have
been applied to many more elements. ID values, on the other hand, should
be used once, and only once, within an HTML document. Therefore, if you
have an element with an `id` value of `lead-para`, no other element in
that document should have an `id` value of
[`lead-para`.]{.keep-together}

That's []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108801440 primary="HTML"
secondary="multiple selector values versus CSS"
data-type="indexterm"}according to the HTML specification, anyway. As
noted previously, CSS doesn't care if your HTML is valid or not: it
should find however many elements a selector can match. That means that
if you sprinkle an HTML document with several elements, all of which
have the same value for their ID attributes, you should get the same
styles applied to each.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_73}

Having []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108799360
primary="Document Object Model (DOM)" secondary="ID selectors and"
data-type="indexterm"}more than one of the same ID value in a document
makes DOM scripting more difficult, since functions like
`getElementById()` depend on there being one, and only one, element with
a given ID value.
:::

Unlike class selectors, ID selectors can't be combined with other IDs,
since ID attributes do not permit a space-separated list of words. An ID
selector can be combined with itself, though: `#warning#warning` will
match the element with an `id` value of `warning`. This should rarely,
if ever, be done, but it is possible.

Another difference between `class` and `id` names is that IDs carry more
weight when you're trying to determine which styles should be applied to
a given element. This is explained in greater detail in
[Chapter 4](../Text/ch04.xhtml#specificity_comma_inheritance){data-type="xref"}.

Also []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108793424 primary="case sensitivity"
secondary="ID selectors" data-type="indexterm"}note that HTML defines
class and ID values to be case-sensitive, so the capitalization of your
class and ID values must match what's found in your documents. Thus, in
the following pairing of CSS and HTML, the element's text will not be
boldfaced:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.criticalInfo {font-weight: bold;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p class="criticalinfo">Don't look down.</p>
```

Because of the change in case for the letter *i*, the selector will not
match the [element]{.keep-together} shown.

secondary="attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_ix_attrib_select
primary="attribute selectors" data-type="indexterm"}class and ID
selectors, what you're really doing is selecting values of

particular to HTML, SVG, and MathML documents as of this writing. In
other markup languages, these class and ID selectors may not be
available (as, indeed, those attributes may not be present).

To []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108734800 primary="CSS2 specification"
secondary="attribute selectors" data-type="indexterm"}address this
situation, CSS2 introduced *attribute selectors*, which can be used to
select elements based on their attributes and the values of those
attributes. There are four general types of attribute selectors: simple
attribute selectors, exact attribute value selectors, partial-match
attribute value selectors, and leading-value attribute selectors.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Simple Attribute Selectors" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch02.xhtml_simple_attribute_selectors .sect2}
## Simple Attribute Selectors {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_75}

If you want to select elements that have a certain attribute, regardless
of that attribute's value, you can use a *simple attribute selector*.
For example, to select all `<h1>` elements that have a `class` attribute
with any value and make their text silver, write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1[class] {color: silver;}
```

So, given the following markup,

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1 class="hoopla">Hello</h1>
<h1>Serenity</h1>
<h1 class="fancy">Fooling</h1>
```

you get the result shown in
[Figure 2-8](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_elements_based_on_their_attrib){data-type="xref"}.

This []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108642240 primary="XML"
secondary="attribute selectors with" data-type="indexterm"}strategy is
very useful in XML documents, as XML languages tend to have element and
attribute names that are specific to their purpose. Consider an XML
language that is used to describe planets of the solar system (we'll
call it *PlanetML*). If you want to select all `<pml-planet>` elements
with a `moons` attribute and make them boldface, thus calling attention
to any planet that has moons, you would write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
pml-planet[moons] {font-weight: bold;}
```

This would cause the text of the second and third elements in the
following markup fragment to be boldfaced, but not the first:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<pml-planet>Venus</pml-planet>
<pml-planet moons="1">Earth</pml-planet>
<pml-planet moons="2">Mars</pml-planet>
```

In []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108621728 primary="HTML"
secondary="attribute selectors with" data-type="indexterm"}HTML
documents, you can use this feature in creative ways. For example, you
could style all images that have an `alt` attribute, thus highlighting
those images that are correctly formed:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img[alt] {outline: 3px solid forestgreen;}
```

This particular example is generally useful more for diagnostic
purposes---determining whether images are indeed correctly marked
up---than for design purposes.

If you wanted to boldface any element that includes `title` information,
which most browsers display as a tool tip when a cursor hovers over the
element, you could write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*[title] {font-weight: bold;}
```

Similarly, you could style only those anchors (`<a>` elements) that have
an `href` attribute, thus applying the styles to any hyperlink but not
to any placeholder anchors.

It is also []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797108575216
primary="attribute selectors" secondary="chaining"
data-type="indexterm"}possible to select elements based on the presence
of more than one attribute. You do this by chaining the attribute
selectors together. For example, to boldface the text of any HTML
hyperlink that has both an `href` and a `title` attribute, you would
write the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href][title] {font-weight: bold;}
```

This would boldface the first link in the following markup, but not the
second or third:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<a href="https://www.w3.org/" title="W3C Home">W3C</a><br />
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Standards Info</a><br />

You can []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_attrib_exact primary="attribute selectors"
secondary="based on exact value" data-type="indexterm"}further narrow
the selection process to encompass only those elements whose attributes
are a certain value. For example, let's say you want to boldface any
hyperlink that points to a certain document on the web server. This
would look something like [the following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href="http://www.css-discuss.org/about.xhtml"] {font-weight: bold;}
```

This will boldface the text of any `a` element that has an `href`
attribute with *exactly* the value
`http://www.css-discuss.org/about.xhtml`. Any change at all, even
dropping the `www.` part or changing to a secure protocol with `https`,
will prevent a match.

Any []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797101183712 primary="XML"
secondary="attribute selectors with" data-type="indexterm"}attribute and
value combination can be specified for any element. However, if that
exact combination does not appear in the document, the selector won't
match anything. Again, XML languages can benefit from this approach to
styling. Let's return to our PlanetML example. Suppose you want to
select only those `planet` elements that have a value of `1` for the
attribute `moons`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
planet[moons="1"] {font-weight: bold;}
```

This would boldface the text of the second element in the following
markup fragment, but not the first or third:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<planet>Venus</planet>
<planet moons="1">Earth</planet>
<planet moons="2">Mars</planet>

secondary="chaining" data-type="indexterm"}attribute selection, you can
chain together multiple attribute value selectors to select a single
document. For example, to double the size of the text of any HTML
hyperlink that has both an `href` with a value of `https://www.w3.org/`
and a `title` attribute with a value of `W3C Home`, you would write
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href="https://www.w3.org/"][title="W3C Home"] {font-size: 200%;}
```

This would double the text size of the first link in the following
markup, but not the second or third:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<a href="https://www.w3.org/" title="W3C Home">W3C</a><br />
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org"
  title="Mozilla Developer Network">Standards Info</a><br />
<a href="http://www.example.org/" title="W3C Home">confused.link</a>
```

[Figure 2-9](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_elements_based_on_attributes_a){data-type="xref"}
shows the results.

</span>Selecting elements based on attributes and their values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Again, this format requires an *exact* match for the attribute's value.
Matching becomes an issue when an attribute selector encounters values
that can, in turn, contain a space-separated list of values (e.g., the
HTML attribute `class`). For example, consider the following markup
fragment:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<planet type="barren rocky">Mercury</planet>
```

The only way to match this element based on its exact attribute value is
to write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
planet[type="barren rocky"] {font-weight: bold;}
```

If you were to write `planet[type="barren"]`, the rule would not match
the example markup and thus would fail. This is true even for the
`class` attribute in HTML. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p class="urgent warning">When handling plutonium, care must be taken to
avoid the formation of a critical mass.</p>
```

To select this element based on its exact attribute value, you would
have to write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p[class="urgent warning"] {font-weight: bold;}
```

This is *not* equivalent to the dot-class notation covered earlier, as
you will see in the next section. Instead, it selects any `p` element
whose `class` attribute has *exactly* the value `urgent warning`, with
the words in that order and a single space between them. It's
effectively an exact string match, whereas when using a `class`
selector, the class order doesn't matter.

Also, be aware that []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797100872000
primary="ID selectors" data-type="indexterm"}ID selectors and attribute
selectors that target the `id` attribute are not precisely the same. In
other words, a subtle but crucial difference exists between
`h1#page-title` and `h1[id="page-title"]`. This difference is explained
in
[Chapter 4](../Text/ch04.xhtml#specificity_comma_inheritance){data-type="xref"}.[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797100839872

For such situations, CSS offers a variety of options for matching

  : [Table 2-1. ]{.label}Substring matching with attribute selectors
  {#substring_matching_with_attribute_select}

The last of these attribute selectors that match on a partial subset of
an element's attribute value is easier to show than it is to describe.
Consider the following rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*[lang|="en"] {color: white;}
```

This rule will select any element whose `lang` attribute is equal to
`en` or begins with `en-`. Therefore, the first three elements in the
following example markup would be selected, but the last two would not:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1 lang="en">Hello!</h1>
<p lang="en-us">Greetings!</p>
<div lang="en-au">G'day!</div>
<p lang="fr">Bonjour!</p>
<h4 lang="cy-en">Jrooana!</h4>
```

In general, the form `[att|="val"]` can be used for any attribute and
its values. Let's say you have a series of figures in an HTML document,
each of which has a filename like *figure-1.gif* or *figure-3.jpg*. You
can match all of these images by using the following
[selector:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img[src|="figure"] {border: 1px solid gray;}
```

Or, if you're creating a CSS framework or pattern library, instead of
creating redundant classes like `"btn btn-small btn-arrow btn-active"`,
you can declare `"btn-small-arrow-active"`, and target the class of
elements with the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*[class|="btn"] { border-radius: 5px;}

<button class="btn-small-arrow-active">Click Me</button>
```

The most common use for this type of attribute selector is to match
language values, as demonstrated in ["The :lang() and :dir()
Pseudo-Classes"](../Text/ch03.xhtml#the_colon_lang_pseudo-class){data-type="xref"}.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Matching one word in a space-separated list" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch02.xhtml_matching_one_word_in_a_space-separated_l .sect3}
### Matching one word in a space-separated list {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_80}

For any []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797095507072
primary="space-separated list of words" data-type="indexterm"}attribute
that accepts a space-separated list of words, you can select elements
based on the presence of any one of those words. The classic example in
HTML is the `class` attribute, which can accept one or more words as its
value. Consider our usual example text:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p class="urgent warning">When handling plutonium, care must be taken to
avoid the formation of a critical mass.</p>
```

Let's say you want to select elements whose `class` attribute contains
the word `warning`. You can do this with an attribute selector:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p[class~="warning"] {font-weight: bold;}
```

Note the presence of the tilde (`~`) in the selector. It is the key to
selection based on the presence of a space-separated word within the
attribute's value. If you omit the tilde, you would have an exact
value-matching attribute selector, as discussed in the previous
[section.]{.keep-together}

This selector construct is equivalent to the dot-class notation
discussed in ["Deciding Between Class and
ID"](#ch02.xhtml_deciding_between_class_and_id){data-type="xref"}. Thus,
`p.warning` and `p[class~="warning"]` are equivalent when applied to
HTML documents. Here's an example that is an HTML version of the
PlanetML markup seen earlier:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<span class="barren rocky">Mercury</span>
<span class="cloudy barren">Venus</span>
<span class="life-bearing cloudy">Earth</span>
```

To italicize all elements with the word `barren` in their `class`
attribute, you write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
span[class~="barren"] {font-style: italic;}
```

This rule's selector will match the first two elements in the example
markup and thus italicize their text, as shown in
[Figure 2-10](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_elements_based_on_portions_of){data-type="xref"}.
This is the same result we would expect from writing
`span.barren {font-style: italic;}`.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch02.xhtml_selecting_elements_based_on_portions_of"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0210.png" width="136" height="16"

<h6 id="ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_81"><span class="label">Figure 2-10.
</span>Selecting elements based on portions of attribute values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So why bother with the tilde-equals attribute selector in HTML? Because
it can be used for any attribute, not just `class`. For example, you
might have a document that contains numerous images, only some of which
are figures. You can use a partial-match value attribute selector aimed
at the `title` text to select only those figures:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img[title~="Figure"] {border: 1px solid gray;}
```

This rule selects any image whose `title` text contains the word
`Figure` (but not `figure`, as title attributes are case-sensitive).
Therefore, as long as all your figures have `title` text that looks
something like "Figure 4. A bald-headed elder statesman," this rule will
match those images. For that matter, the selector `img[title~="Figure"]`
will also match a title attribute with the value "How to Figure Out
Who's in Charge." Any image that does not have a `title` attribute, or
whose `title` value doesn't contain the word `Figure`, won't be matched.

### Matching a substring within an attribute value {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_82}

Sometimes you want to []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_asterisk_attrib2

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_ix_asterisk_attrib
primary="*= (asterisk, equal sign), in attribute selectors"
data-type="indexterm"}select elements based on a portion of their
attribute values, but the values in question aren't space-separated
lists of words. In these cases, you can use the asterisk-equals
substring matching form `[attr*="val"]` to match substrings that appear
anywhere inside the attribute values. For example, the following CSS
matches any `<span>` element whose `class` attribute contains the
substring `cloud`, so both "cloudy" planets are matched, as shown in
[Figure 2-11](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_elements_based_on_substrings_w){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
span[class*="cloud"] {font-style: italic;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<span class="barren rocky">Mercury</span>
<span class="cloudy barren">Venus</span>
<span class="life-bearing cloudy">Earth</span>
```

<h6 id="ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_83"><span class="label">Figure 2-11.
</span>Selecting elements based on substrings within attribute
values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note the presence of the asterisk (`*`) in the selector. It's the key to
selecting elements based on the presence of a substring within an
attribute's value. To be clear, it is *not* related to the universal
selector, other than it uses the same character.

As you can imagine, this particular capability has many useful
applications. For example, suppose you want to specially style any links
to the W3C's website. Instead of classing them all and writing styles
based on that class, you could instead write the following rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href*="w3.org"] {font-weight: bold;}
```

You aren't confined to the `class` and `href` attributes. Any attribute
is up for grabs here (`title`, `alt`, `src`, `id`...); if the attribute
has a value, you can style based on a substring within that value. The
following rule draws attention to any image with the string `space` in
its source URL:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img[src*="space"] {outline: 5px solid red;}
```

[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797095141712 primary="<input> element"
primary-sortas="input element" data-type="indexterm"}Similarly, the
following rule draws attention to `<input>` elements that have a title
telling the user what to do, along with any other input whose title
contains the substring `format` in its title:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input[title*="format"] {background-color: #dedede;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<input type="tel"
    title="Telephone number should be formatted as XXX-XXX-XXXX"
    pattern="\d{3}\-\d{3}\-\d{4}">
```

A common use for the general substring attribute selector is to match a
section of a class in pattern library class names. Elaborating on the
preceding example, we can target any class name that starts with `btn`
followed by a hyphen, and that contains the substring `arrow` preceded
by a hyphen, by using the pipe-equals attribute selector:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*[class|="btn"][class*="-arrow"]:after { content: "▼";}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<button class="btn-small-arrow-active">Click Me</button>
```

The []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797095018784 primary="case sensitivity"
secondary="attribute selectors" data-type="indexterm"}matches are exact:
if you include whitespace in your selector, whitespace must also be
present in an attribute's value. The attribute values are case-sensitive
when the underlying document language requires case sensitivity. Class
names, titles, URLs, and ID values are all case-sensitive, but
enumerated HTML attribute values, such as input type keyword values, are
not:[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797095017808 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}want to select elements based on a substring at

pattern `[att^="val"]` is what you're seeking. This can be particularly
useful when you want to style types of links differently, as illustrated
in
[Figure 2-12](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_elements_based_on_substrings_t){data-type="xref"}:

</span>Selecting elements based on substrings that begin attribute
values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In another use case, you may want to style all images in an article that
are also figures, like the figures you see throughout this text.
Assuming that the `alt` text of each figure begins with text in the
pattern "Figure 5"---which is an entirely reasonable assumption in this
case---you can select only those images with the caret-equals attribute
selector:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img[alt^="Figure"] {border: 2px solid gray;  display: block; margin: 2em auto;}
```

The potential drawback here is that *any* `<img>` element whose `alt`
starts with `Figure` will be selected, whether or not it's meant to be
an illustrative figure. The likeliness of that occurring depends on the
document in question.

Another use case is selecting all of the calendar events that occur on
Mondays. In this case, let's assume all of the events have a `title`
attribute containing a date in the format "Monday, March 5th, 2012."
Selecting them all is just a simple matter of using
[`[title^="Monday"]`.]{.keep-together}

primary="\"i\", in attribute selectors" data-type="indexterm"}closing
bracket of an attribute selector will allow that selector to match
attribute values case-insensitively, regardless of document language
rules. For example, suppose you want to select all links to PDF
documents, but you don't know if they'll end in *.pdf*, *.PDF*, or even
*.Pdf*. Here's how:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href$='.PDF' i]
```

Adding that humble little `i` means the selector will match any `a`
element whose `href` attribute's value ends in `.pdf`, regardless of the
capitalization of the letters *P*, *D*, and *F*.

This case-insensitivity option is available for all the attribute
selectors we've covered. Note, however, that this applies to only the
*values* in the attribute selectors. It does not enforce case
insensitivity on the attribute names themselves. Thus, in a
case-sensitive language, `planet[type*="rock" i]` will match all of the
following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<planet type="barren rocky">Mercury</planet>
<planet type="cloudy ROCKY">Venus</planet>
<planet type="life-bearing Rock">Earth</planet>
```

It will *not* match the following element, because the attribute `TYPE`
isn't matched by `type` in XML:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<planet TYPE="dusty rock">Mars</planet>

This is in languages that enforce case sensitivity in the element and

Much of the []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099722176
primary="sibling elements, document structure"
data-type="indexterm"}power of CSS is based on the *parent-child
relationship* of elements. HTML documents (and most structured documents
of any kind) are based on a hierarchy of elements, which is visible in
the "tree" view of the document (see
[Figure 2-14](#ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_structure){data-type="xref"}).
In this hierarchy, each element fits somewhere into the overall
structure of the document. Every element in the document is either the
*parent* or the *child* of another element, and it's often both. If a
parent has more than one child, those children are *siblings*.

<div id="ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_structure" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_93"><span class="label">Figure 2-14.
</span>A document tree structure</h6>
</div>
</figure>

An element is said to be the parent of another element if it appears
directly above that element in the document hierarchy. For example, in
[Figure 2-14](#ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_structure){data-type="xref"},
the first `<p>` element from the left is parent to the `<em>` and
`<strong>` elements, while `<strong>` is parent to an anchor (`<a>`)
element, which is itself parent to another `<em>` element. Conversely,
an element is the child of another element if it is directly beneath the
other element. Thus, the anchor element on the far right side of
[Figure 2-14](#ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_structure){data-type="xref"}
is the child of a `<p>` element, which is in turn child to the `<body>`
element, and so on.

The []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099659232
primary="ancestor-descendant relationship, document structure"
data-type="indexterm"}terms *parent* and *child* are specific
applications of the terms *ancestor* and *descendant*, respectively.
There is a difference between them: in the tree view, if an element is
exactly one level above or below another, those elements have a
*parent-child* relationship. If the path from one element to another is
traced through two or more levels, the elements have an
ancestor-descendant relationship, but not a parent-child relationship.
(A child is also a descendant, and a parent is also an ancestor.) In
[Figure 2-14](#ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_structure){data-type="xref"},
the uppermost `<ul>` element is parent to two `<li>` elements, but the
uppermost `<ul>` is also the ancestor of every element descended from
its `<li>` element, all the way down to the most deeply nested `<li>`
elements. Those `<li>` elements, children of the `<ol>`, are siblings.

Also, in
[Figure 2-14](#ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_structure){data-type="xref"},
there is an []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099650768 primary="elements"
secondary="root" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099649760
primary="root elements" data-type="indexterm"}anchor that is a child of
`<strong>`, but also a descendant of the `<p>`, `<body>`, and `<html>`
elements. The `<body>` element is an ancestor of everything that the
browser will display by default, and the `<html>` element is ancestor to
the entire document. For this reason, in an HTML document, the `<html>`
element is also called the *root element*.

## Defining Descendant Selectors {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_94}

The first []{#ch02.xhtml_ix_descend_selector
primary="descendant (contextual) selectors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_ix_selector_desc
primary="selectors" secondary="descendant (contextual)"
data-type="indexterm"}benefit of understanding this model is the ability
to define *descendant selectors*. Defining descendant selectors is the
act of creating rules that operate in certain structural circumstances
but not others. As an example, let's say you want to style only those
`<em>` elements that are descended from `<h1>` elements. To do so, write
the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 em {color: gray;}
```

This rule will make gray any text in an `<em>` element that is the
descendant of an `<h1>` element. Other `<em>` text, such as that found
in a paragraph or a block quote, will not be selected by this rule.
[Figure 2-15](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_an_element_based_on_its_contex){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the result.

<figure class="coderesult">

</span>Selecting an element based on its context</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In a []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099620512 primary="combinators"
secondary="descendant selectors" data-type="indexterm"}descendant
selector, the selector side of a rule is composed of two or more
space-separated selectors. The space between the selectors is an example
of a *combinator*. Each space combinator can be translated as "found
within," "which is part of," or "that is a descendant of," but only if
you read the selector right to left. Thus, `h1 em` can be translated as,
"Any `<em>` element that is a descendant of an `<h1>` element."

To read the selector left to right, you might phrase it like, "Any
`<h1>` that contains an `<em>` will have the following styles applied to
the `<em>`." That's much more verbose and confusing, and it's why we,
like the browser, read selectors from right to left.

You aren't limited to two selectors. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul ol ul em {color: gray;}
```

In this case, as
[Figure 2-16](#ch02.xhtml_a_very_specific_descendant_selector){data-type="xref"}
shows, any emphasized text that is part of an unordered list that is
part of an ordered list that is itself part of an unordered list (yes,
this is correct) will be gray. This is obviously a very specific
selection criterion.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch02.xhtml_a_very_specific_descendant_selector" class="figure">

</span>A very specific descendant selector</h6>

</figure>

Descendant selectors can be extremely powerful. Let's consider a common
example. Assume you have a document with a sidebar and a main area. The
sidebar has a blue background, the main area has a white background, and
both areas include lists of links. You can't set all links to be blue
because they'd be impossible to read in the sidebar, and you also can't
set all links to white because they'd disappear in the main part of the
page.

The solution: descendant selectors. In this case, you give the element
that contains your sidebar a class of `sidebar` and enclose the main
part of the page in a `<main>` element. Then, you write styles like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.sidebar {background: blue;}
main {background: white;}
.sidebar a:any-link {color: white;}
main a:any-link {color: blue;}
```

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_98}

`:any-link` refers to both visited and unvisited links. We'll talk about
it in detail in
[Chapter 3](../Text/ch03.xhtml#pseudo_classes_and_elements){data-type="xref"}.
:::

Here's another example: let's say that you want gray to be the text
color of any `<b>` (boldfaced) element that is part of a `blockquote`
and for any bold text that is found in a normal paragraph:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
blockquote b, p b {color: gray;}
```

The result is that the text within `<b>` elements that are descended
from paragraphs or block quotes will be gray.

One overlooked aspect of descendant selectors is that the degree of
separation between two elements can be practically infinite. For
example, if you write `ul em`, that syntax will select any `<em>`
element descended from a `<ul>` element, no matter how deeply nested the
`<em>` may be. Thus, `ul em` would select the `<em>` element in the
following markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ul>
  <li>List item 1
    <ol>
      <li>List item 1-1</li>
      <li>List item 1-2</li>
      <li>List item 1-3
        <ol>
          <li>List item 1-3-1</li>
          <li>List item <em>1-3-2</em></li>
          <li>List item 1-3-3</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>List item 1-4</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
```

A more subtle aspect of descendant selectors is that they have no notion
of element proximity. In other words, the closeness of two elements
within the document tree has no bearing on whether a rule applies. This
is important when it comes to specificity (which we'll cover in the next
chapter) and when considering rules that might appear to cancel each
other out.

For example, consider the following (which contains `:not()`, a selector
type we'll discuss in ["The negation
pseudo-class"](../Text/ch03.xhtml#the_negation_pseudo-class){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div:not(.help) span {color: gray;}
div.help span {color: red;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div class="help">
   <div class="aside">
      This text contains <span>a span element</span> within.
   </div>
</div>
```

What the CSS says, in effect, is "any `<span>` inside a `<div>` that
doesn't have a `class` containing the word `help` should be gray" in the
first rule, and "any `<span>` inside a `<div>` whose `class` contains
the word `help`" in the second rule. In the given markup fragment,
*both* rules apply to the `<span>` shown.

Because the two rules have equal specificity weight and the `red` rule
is written last, it wins out, and the `<span>` is red. The fact that
`div class="aside"` is "closer to" `<span>` than `div class="help"` is
irrelevant. Again: descendant selectors have no notion of element
proximity. Both rules match, only one color can be applied, and because
of the way CSS works, red is the winner here. (We'll discuss why that's
so in the next chapter.)[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099257136 primary=""

###### Note {#ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_99}

As of early 2023, proposals have been made to add element-proximity
awareness to CSS via *selector scoping*, but the proposals are still
being actively revised and may not come to fruition.

primary="combinators" secondary="child" data-type="indexterm"}cases, you
don't want to select an arbitrarily descended element. Rather, you want
to narrow your range to select an element that is specifically a child
of another element. You might, for example, want to select a `<strong>`
element only if it is a child (as opposed to any other level of
descendant) of an `<h1>` element. []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099299856
primary="greater-than sign (>)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797099299120
primary="> (greater-than sign)" data-type="indexterm"}To do this, you
use the *child combinator*, which is the greater-than symbol (`>`):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 > strong {color: red;}
```

This rule will make red the `<strong>` element shown in the first
`<h1>`, but not the second:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>This is <strong>very</strong> important.</h1>
<h1>This is <em>really <strong>very</strong></em> important.</h1>
```

Read right to left, the selector `h1 > strong` translates as, "Selects
any `<strong>` element that is a direct child of an `<h1>` element." The
child combinator can be optionally surrounded by whitespace. Thus,
`h1 > strong`, `h1> strong`, and `h1>strong` are all equivalent. You can
use or omit whitespace as you wish.

When viewing the document as a tree structure, we can see that a child
selector restricts its matches to elements that are directly connected
in the tree.
[Figure 2-18](#ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_fragment){data-type="xref"}

In this tree fragment, you can pick out parent-child relationships. For
example, the `<a>` element is a parent to `<strong>` and is also a child
of the `<p>` element. You could match elements in this fragment with the
selectors `p > a` and `a > strong`, but not `p > strong`, since
`<strong>` is a descendant of `<p>` but not its child.

You can also combine descendant and child combinators in the same
selector. Thus, `table.summary td > p` will select any `<p>` element
that is a *child* of a `<td>` element that is itself *descended* from a
`<table>` element that has a `class` attribute containing the word
`summary`.

data-type="indexterm"}want to style the paragraph immediately after a
heading, or give a special margin to a list that immediately follows a
paragraph. To select an element that immediately follows another element
with the same parent, you use the *adjacent-sibling combinator*,
represented as a plus symbol (+). As with the child combinator, the
symbol can be surrounded by whitespace, or not, at your discretion.

To remove the top margin from a paragraph immediately following an
`<h1>` element, write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 + p {margin-top: 0;}
```

The selector is read as, "Select any `<p>` element that immediately
follows an `<h1>` element that *shares a parent* with the `<p>`
element."

To visualize how this selector works, let's once again consider a
fragment of a document tree, shown in
[Figure 2-19](#ch02.xhtml_another_document_tree_fragment){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="width_set_70">
<div id="ch02.xhtml_another_document_tree_fragment" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_103"><span class="label">Figure 2-19.
</span>Another document tree fragment</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this fragment, a pair of lists descends from a `<div>` element, one
ordered and the other not, each containing three list items. Each list
is an adjacent sibling, and the list items themselves are also adjacent
siblings. However, the list items from the first list are *not* siblings
of the second, as the two sets of list items do not share the same
parent element. (At best, they're cousins, and CSS has no cousin
selector.)

Remember that you can select the second of two adjacent siblings only
with a single combinator. Thus, if you write
`li + li {font-weight: bold;}`, only the second and third items in each
list will be boldfaced. The first list items will be unaffected, as
illustrated in
[Figure 2-20](#ch02.xhtml_selecting_adjacent_siblings){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch02.xhtml_selecting_adjacent_siblings" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0220.png" width="255" height="160"

<h6 id="ch02.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_104"><span class="label">Figure 2-20.
</span>Selecting adjacent siblings</h6>
</div>
</figure>

To work properly, CSS requires that the two elements appear in *source
order*. In our example, an `<ol>` element is followed by a `<ul>`
element. This allows us to select the second element with `ol + ul`, but
we cannot select the first by using the same syntax. For `ul + ol` to
match, an ordered list must immediately follow an unordered list.

Keep in mind that text content between two elements does *not* prevent
the adjacent-sibling combinator from working. Consider this markup
fragment, whose tree view would be the same as that shown in
[Figure 2-18](#ch02.xhtml_a_document_tree_fragment){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 1</li>
  </ol>
  This is some text that is part of the 'div'.
  <ul>
    <li>A list item</li>
    <li>Another list item</li>
    <li>Yet another list item</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Even though we have text between the two lists, we can still match the
second list with the selector `ol + ul`. That's because the intervening
text is not contained within a sibling element, but is instead part of
the parent `<div>`. If we wrapped that text in a paragraph element, it
would then prevent `ol + ul` from matching the second list. Instead, we
might have to write something like `ol + p + ul`.

As the []{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797102358016 primary="combinators"
secondary="multiple types" data-type="indexterm"}following example
illustrates, the adjacent-sibling combinator can be used in conjunction
with other combinators:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html > body table + ul{margin-top: 1.5em;}
```

The selector translates as, "Selects any `<ul>` element that immediately
follows a sibling `<table>` element that is descended from a `<body>`
element that is itself a child of an `<html>` element."

As with all combinators, you can place the adjacent-sibling combinator
in a more complex setting, such as `div#content h1 + div ol`. That
selector is read as, "Selects any `<ol>` element that is descended from
a `<div>` when the `<div>` is the adjacent sibling of an `<h1>` that is
itself descended from a `<div>` whose `id` attribute has a value of
`content`."[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797102351056 primary=""

a parent (the `<div>`).[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797102164272 primary=""

By using selectors based on the document's language, you can create CSS
rules that apply to a large number of similar elements just as easily as
you can construct rules that apply in very narrow circumstances. The
ability to group together both selectors and rules keeps stylesheets
compact and flexible, which incidentally leads to smaller file sizes and
faster download times.[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797102104192 primary=""

startref="ix_selctor_doc_struct_ch2" data-type="indexterm"}

Selectors are the one thing that user agents usually must get right,
because the inability to correctly interpret selectors pretty much
prevents a user agent from using CSS at all. On the flip side, it's
crucial for authors to correctly write selectors because errors can
prevent the user agent from applying the styles as intended. An integral
part of correctly understanding selectors and how they can be combined
is having a strong grasp of how selectors relate to document structure
and how mechanisms---such as inheritance and the cascade itself---come
into play when determining how an element will be
styled.[]{#ch02.xhtml_idm45797102101920 primary=""
startref="ix_selector_ch2" data-type="indexterm"}

The selectors we covered in this chapter aren't the end of the story,
though. They're not even half the story. In the next chapter, we'll dive
into the powerful and ever-expanding world of pseudo-class and
pseudo-element selectors.

In the previous chapter, you saw how selectors can match a single
element or a collection of elements, using fairly simple expressions
that match HTML attributes in the document. Those are great if your need
is just to style based on attributes, but what if you need to style part
of a document based on its current state or structure? Or if you want to
select all the form elements that are disabled, or those that are
required for form submission to be allowed? For those things, and a
great deal more, CSS has the pseudo-class and pseudo-element selectors.

# Pseudo-Class Selectors {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_108}

*Pseudo-class selectors* let you []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_pseudo_class_ch3
primary="pseudo-class selectors" data-type="indexterm"}assign styles to
what are, in effect, phantom classes inferred by the state of certain
elements, or markup patterns within the document, or even by the state
of the document itself.

The term *phantom classes* might seem a little odd, but it really is the
best way to think of how pseudo-classes work. For example, suppose you
want to highlight every other row of a data table. You could do that by
marking up every other row with something like `class="even"` and then
writing CSS to highlight rows with that class---or (as you'll soon see)
you could use a pseudo-class selector to achieve the same effect, one
that will act as if you've added all those classes to the markup even
though you haven't.

One aspect of pseudo-classes needs to be made explicit here:
pseudo-classes always refer to the element to which they're attached,
and to no other. Seems like a weirdly obvious thing to say, right? The
reason we make it explicit is that for some pseudo-classes, it's a
common error to think they are descriptors that refer to descendant
elements.

To illustrate this, Eric would like to share a personal anecdote:

> When my first child was born in 2003, I announced it online, as one
> does. A number of people responded with congratulations and CSS jokes,
> chief among them the selector `#ericmeyer:first-child` (we'll get to
> `:first-child` in just a bit). But that selector would select me, not
> my daughter, and only if I were the first child of my own parents
> (which, as it happens, I am). To properly select *my* first child,
> that selector would need to be `#ericmeyer > :first-child`.

The confusion is understandable, which is why we're addressing it here.
Reminders are found throughout the following sections. Just always keep
in mind that the effect of pseudo-classes is to apply a sort of phantom
class to the element to which they're attached, and you should be OK.

Before we really get started, a word about

secondary="chaining pseudo-classes"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797102085056
primary="chaining" data-type="indexterm"}chaining. CSS makes it possible
to combine (*chain*) pseudo-classes together. For example, you can make
unvisited links red when they're hovered and visited links maroon when
they are hovered:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link:hover {color: red;}
a:visited:hover {color: maroon;}
```

The order you specify doesn't matter; you could also write
`a:hover:link` to the same effect as `a:link:hover`. It's also possible
to assign separate hover styles to unvisited and visited links that are
in another language---for example, German:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link:hover:lang(de) {color: gray;}
a:visited:hover:lang(de) {color: silver;}
```

Be careful not to combine mutually exclusive pseudo-classes. For
example, a link cannot be both visited and unvisited, so
`a:link:visited` doesn't make any sense and will never match anything.

### Selecting the root element {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_111}

This is the []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797102013248
primary=":root pseudo-class" primary-sortas="root pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}quintessence of structural simplicity: the
pseudo-class `:root` selects the root element of the document.
[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797102011728 primary="HTML"
secondary="root element in" data-type="indexterm"}In HTML, this is
*always* the `<html>` element. []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797102009760
primary="XML" secondary="root element and" data-type="indexterm"}The
real benefit of this selector is found when writing stylesheets for XML
languages, as the root element may be different in every language---for
example, in SVG it's the `<svg>` element, and in our earlier PlanetML
examples it was the `<pml>` element---or even when you have more than
one possible root element within a single language (though not a single
document!).

Here's an example of styling the root element in HTML, as illustrated in
[Figure 3-1](#ch03.xhtml_styling_the_root_element){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:root {border: 10px dotted gray;}

In HTML documents, you can always select the `<html>` element directly,
without having to use the `:root` pseudo-class. The two selectors differ
in terms of specificity, which we'll cover in
[Chapter 4](../Text/ch04.xhtml#specificity_comma_inheritance){data-type="xref"},
but otherwise they'll have the same effect.

::: {#ch03.xhtml_selecting_empty_elements .sect3}
### Selecting empty elements {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_113}

With the []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797101957696 primary=":empty pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="empty pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797101956688
primary="text nodes" secondary=":empty pseudo-class using"
secondary-sortas="empty pseudo-class using"
data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-class `:empty`, you can select any element
that has no children of any kind, *including* text nodes, which covers
both text and whitespace. This can be useful in suppressing elements
that a content management system (CMS) has generated without filling in
any actual content. Thus, `p:empty {display: none;}` would prevent the
display of any empty paragraphs.

Note that in order to be matched, an element must be, from a parsing
perspective, truly empty---no whitespace, visible content, or descendant
elements. Of the following elements, only the first and last would be
matched by `p:empty`:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><!—-a comment--></p>
```

The second and third paragraphs are not matched by `:empty` because they
are not empty: they contain, respectively, a single space and a single
newline character. Both are considered text nodes and thus prevent a
state of emptiness. The last paragraph matches because comments are not
considered content, not even whitespace. But put even one space or
newline to either side of that comment, and `p:empty` would fail to
match.

You might be tempted to just style all empty elements with something
like `*:empty {display: none;}`, but there's a hidden catch: `:empty`
matches HTML's empty elements, like `<img>`, `<hr>`, `<br>`, and
`<input>`. It could even match `<textarea>`, unless you insert some
default text into the `<textarea>` element.

Thus, in terms of matching elements, `img` and `img:empty` are
effectively the same. (They are different in terms of specificity, which
we'll cover in the next chapter.)

### Selecting only children {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_114}

If you've ever []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_only_child_pseudo
primary=":only-child pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="only-child pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}wanted to
select all the images that are wrapped by a hyperlink element, the
`:only-child` pseudo-class is for you. It selects elements when they are
the only child element of another element. So let's say you want to add
a border to any image that's the only child of another element. You'd
write the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img:only-child {border: 1px solid black;}
```

This would match any image that meets those criteria. Therefore, if you
had a paragraph that contained an image and no other child elements, the
image would be selected regardless of all the text surrounding it. If
what you're really after is images that are sole children and found
inside hyperlinks, you just modify the selector like so (which is
illustrated in
[Figure 3-2](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_images_that_are_only_children){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href] img:only-child {border: 2px solid black;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

</span>Selecting images that are only children inside links</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You should remember two things about `:only-child`. The first is that
you *always* apply it to the element you want to be an only child, not
to the parent element, as explained earlier. That brings up the second
thing to remember, which is that when you use `:only-child` in a
descendant selector, you aren't restricting the elements listed to a
parent-child relationship.

To go back to the hyperlinked-image example, `a[href] img:only-child`
matches any image that is an only child and is descended from an `a`
element, whether or not it's a *child* of an `a` element. To match, the
element image must be the only child of its direct parent and also a
descendant of an `a` element with an `href` attribute, but that parent
can itself be a descendant of the same `<a>` element. Therefore, all
three of the images in the following would be matched, as shown in
[Figure 3-3](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_images_that_are_only_child){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href] img:only-child {border: 5px solid black;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<a href="http://w3.org/"><img src="w3.png" alt="W3C"></a>
<a href="http://w3.org/"><span><img src="w3.png" alt="W3C"></span></a>

</div>
</figure>

In each case, the image is the only child element of its parent, and it
is also descended from an `<a>` element. Thus, all three images are
matched by the rule shown. If you want to restrict the rule so that it
matches images that are the only children of `<a>` elements, you add the
child combinator to yield `a[href] > img:only-child`. With that change,
only the first of the three images shown in
[Figure 3-3](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_images_that_are_only_child){data-type="xref"}
would be matched.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797101675200 primary=""

### Using only-of-type selection {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_117}

That's all []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_only_type_pseudo
primary=":only-of-type pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="only-of-type pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}great,
but what if you want to match images that are the only images inside
hyperlinks, but other elements may be in there with them? Consider the
following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<a href="http://w3.org/"><b>•</b><img src="w3.png" alt="W3C"></a>
```

In this case, we have an `a` element that has two children: `<b>` and
`<img>`. That image, no longer the only child of its parent (the
hyperlink), can never be matched using `:only-child`. However, it *can*
be matched using `:only-of-type`. This is illustrated in
[Figure 3-4](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_images_that_are_the_only_sibli){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href] img:only-of-type {border: 5px solid black;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<a href="http://w3.org/"><b>•</b><img src="w3.png" alt="W3C"></a>
<a href="http://w3.org/"><span><b>•</b><img src="w3.png" alt="W3C"></span></a>

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_118"><span class="label">Figure 3-4.
</span>Selecting images that are the only sibling of their type</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The difference is that `:only-of-type` will match any element that is
the only one of its type among all its siblings, whereas `:only-child`
will match only if an element has no [siblings]{.keep-together} at all.

This can be very useful in cases such as selecting images within
paragraphs without having to worry about the presence of hyperlinks or
other inline elements:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p > img:only-of-type {float: right; margin: 20px;}
```

As long as there aren't multiple images that are children of the same
paragraph, the image will be floated to the right.

You can also use this pseudo-class to apply extra styles to an `<h2>`
when it's the only one in a given section of a document, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section > h2 {margin: 1em 0 0.33em; font-size: 1.8rem; border-bottom: 1px solid
   gray;}
section > h2:only-of-type {font-size: 2.4rem;}
```

Given those rules, any `<section>` that has only one child `<h2>` will
have that `<h2>` appear larger than usual. If a `section` has two or
more `<h2>` children, neither will be larger than the other. The
presence of other children---whether they are other heading levels,
tables, paragraphs, lists, and so on---will not interfere with matching.

One more point to make clear is that `:only-of-type` refers to elements
and nothing else. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.unique:only-of-type {color: red;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>
  <p class="unique">This paragraph has a 'unique' class.</p>
  <p>This paragraph doesn't have a class at all.</p>
</div>
```

In this case, neither of the paragraphs will be selected. Why not?
Because two paragraphs are descendants of the `<div>`, neither can be
the only one of their type.

The class name is irrelevant here. We can be fooled into thinking that
*type* is a generic description, because of the way we parse language.
*Type*, in the way `:only-of-type` means it, refers only to the element
type, as with type selectors. Thus, `p.unique:only-of-type` means,
"Select any `<p>` element that is the only `<p>` element among its
siblings if it also has a `class` of `unique`." It does *not* mean,
"Select any `<p>` element whose `class` attribute contains the word
`unique` when it's the only sibling paragraph to meet that
criterion."[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797093790240 primary=""

### Selecting first children {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_119}

It's pretty []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_first_child_pseudo
primary=":first-child pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="first-child pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}common
to want to apply special styling to the first or last child of an
element. A typical example is styling a bunch of navigation links in a
tab bar and wanting to put special visual touches on the first or last
tab (or both). If we didn't have structural selectors, this could be
done by applying special classes to those elements. We have
pseudo-classes to carry the load for us, removing the need to manually
figure out which elements are the first and last.

The pseudo-class `:first-child` is used to select elements that are the
first children of other elements. Consider the following markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>
  <p>These are the necessary steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Insert key</li>
    <li>Turn key <strong>clockwise</strong></li>
    <li>Push accelerator</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Do <em>not</em> push the brake at the same time as the accelerator.
  </p>
</div>
```

In this example, the elements that are first children are the first
`<p>`, the first `<li>`, and the `<strong>` and `<em>` elements, which
are all the first children of their respective parents. Given the
following two rules,

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p:first-child {font-weight: bold;}
li:first-child {text-transform: uppercase;}
```

we get the result shown in
[Figure 3-5](#ch03.xhtml_styling_first_children){data-type="xref"}.

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_120"><span class="label">Figure 3-5.
</span>Styling first children</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The first rule boldfaces any `<p>` element that is the first child of
another element. The second rule uppercases any `<li>` element that is
the first child of another element (which, in HTML, must be either an
`<ol>` or `<ul>` element).

As has been mentioned, the most common error is assuming that a selector
like `p:first-child` will select the first child of a `<p>` element.
Remember the nature of pseudo-classes, which is to attach a sort of
phantom class to the anchor element, the element associated with the
pseudo-class. If you were to add actual classes to the markup, it would
look like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>

The first rule boldfaces any `<p>` element that is the last child of
another element. The second rule uppercases any `<li>` element that is
the last child of another element. If you wanted to select the `<em>`
element inside that last paragraph, you could use the selector
`p:last-child em`, which selects any `<em>` element that descends from a
`<p>` element that is itself the last child of another element.

Interestingly, you can []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797093418960

elements:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p:only-child {color: red;}
p:first-child:last-child {background-color: red;}
```

Either way, we get paragraphs with red foreground and background colors
(not a good idea, to be clear).

### Selecting the first and last of a type {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_123}

In a []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_first_type_pseudo
primary=":first-of-type pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="first-of-type pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}manner
similar to selecting the first and last children of an element, you can
select the first or last of a type of element within another element.
This permits actions like selecting the first `<table>` inside a given
element, regardless of whatever elements come before it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
table:first-of-type {border-top: 2px solid gray;}
```

Note that this does *not* apply to the entire document; the rule shown
will not select the first table in the document and skip all the others.
It will instead select the first `<table>` element within each element
that contains one, and skip any sibling `<table>` elements that come
after the first. Thus, given the document structure shown in
[Figure 3-7](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_first-of-type_tables){data-type="xref"},
the circled nodes are the ones that are selected.

Within the context of tables, a useful way to select the first data cell
within a row regardless of whether a header cell comes before it in the
row is as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
td:first-of-type {border-left: 1px solid red;}
```

That would select the first data cell in each of the following table
rows (that is, the cells containing `7` and `R`):

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<tr>
  <th scope="row">Count</th><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>R</td><td>X</td><td>-</td>
</tr>
```

Compare that to the []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797093230288
primary=":first-child pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="first-child pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}effects
of `td:first-child`, which would select the first `<td>` element in the
second row, but not in the first row.

The []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_last_type_pseudo
primary=":last-of-type pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="last-of-type pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}flip
side is `:last-of-type`, which selects the last instance of a given type
from among its sibling elements. In a way, it's just like
`:first-of-type`, except you start with the last element in a group of
siblings and walk backward toward the first element until you reach an
instance of the type. Given the document structure shown in
[Figure 3-8](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_last-of-type_tables){data-type="xref"},
the circled nodes are the ones selected by `table:last-of-type`.

primary=":only-of-type pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="only-of-type pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}noted

from among their sibling elements; thus, every set of siblings is

(or last) of all the elements of a type within the entire document as a
single group. Each set of elements that shares a parent is its own
group, and you can select the first (or last) of a type within each
group.

Similar to what was noted in the previous section, you can combine these
two pseudo-classes to create a version of `:only-of-type`. The following

### Selecting every nth child {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_126}

If you can []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_nth_child_pseudo
primary=":nth-child() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="nth-child() pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}select
elements that are the first, last, or only children of other elements,
how about every third child? All even children? Only the ninth child?
Rather than try to define a literally infinite number of named
pseudo-classes, CSS has the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class. By filling
integers or even basic algebraic expressions into the parentheses, you
can select any arbitrarily numbered child element you like.

Let's start with the `:nth-child()` equivalent of `:first-child`, which
is `:nth-child(1)`. In the following example, the selected elements will
be the first paragraph and the first list item:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p:nth-child(1) {font-weight: bold;}
li:nth-child(1) {text-transform: uppercase;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>
  <p>These are the necessary steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Insert key</li>
    <li>Turn key <strong>clockwise</strong></li>
    <li>Push accelerator</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Do <em>not</em> push the brake at the same time as the accelerator.
  </p>
</div>
```

If we change the numbers from `1` to `2`, however, then no paragraphs
will be selected, and the middle (or second) list item will be selected,
as illustrated in
[Figure 3-9](#ch03.xhtml_styling_second_children){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p:nth-child(2) {font-weight: bold;}
li:nth-child(2) {text-transform: uppercase;}
```

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_127"><span class="label">Figure 3-9.
</span>Styling second children</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You can insert any integer you choose. If you have a use case for
selecting any ordered list that is the 93rd child element of its parent,
`ol:nth-child(93)` is ready to serve. This will match the 93rd child of
any parent as long as that child is an ordered list. (This does not mean
the 93rd ordered list among its siblings; see ["Selecting every nth of a
type"](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_every_nth_of_a_type){data-type="xref"} for
that.)

Is there a reason to use `:nth-child(1)` rather than `:first-child`? No.
In this case, use whichever you prefer. There is literally no difference
between them.

More powerfully, you can use simple algebraic expressions in the form
*`a`*`n` + *`b`* or *`a`*`n` `-` *`b`* to define recurring instances,
where *`a`* and *`b`* are integers and `n` is present as itself.
Furthermore, the `+` *`b`* or `−` *`b`* part is optional and thus can be
dropped if it isn't needed.

Let's suppose we want to select every third list item in an unordered
list, starting with the first. The following makes that possible,
selecting the first and fourth items, as shown in
[Figure 3-10](#ch03.xhtml_styling_every_third_list_item){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul > li:nth-child(3n + 1) {text-transform: uppercase;}
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch03.xhtml_styling_every_third_list_item" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_128"><span class="label">Figure 3-10.
</span>Styling every third list item</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The way this works is that `n` represents the series 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and
on into infinity. The browser then solves for `3n + 1`, yielding 1, 4,
7, 10, 13, and so on. Were we to drop the `+ 1`, thus leaving us with
simply `3n`, the results would be 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on. Since there
is no zeroth list item---all element counting starts with 1, to the
likely chagrin of array-slingers everywhere---the first list item
selected by this expression would be the third list item in the list.

Given that element counting starts with 1, it is a minor trick to deduce
that `:nth-child(2n)` will select even-numbered children, and either
`:nth-child(2n+1)` or `:nth-child(2n-1)` will select odd-numbered
children. You can commit that to memory, or you can use the two special
keywords that `:nth-child()` accepts: `even` and `odd`. Want to
highlight every other row of a table, starting with the first? Here's
how you do it, with the results shown in
[Figure 3-11](#ch03.xhtml_styling_every_other_table_row){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
tr:nth-child(odd) {background: silver;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch03.xhtml_styling_every_other_table_row" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0311.png" width="600" height="358"

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_129"><span class="label">Figure 3-11.
</span>Styling every other table row</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Anything more complex than every-other-element requires an *`a`*`n` `+`
*`b`* expression.

Note that when you want to use a negative number for *`b`*, you have to
remove the `+` sign, or else the selector will fail entirely. Of the
following two rules, only the first will do anything. The second will be
dropped by the parser and the entire declaration block will [be
ignored:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
tr:nth-child(4n - 2) {background: silver;}
tr:nth-child(3n + −2) {background: red;}  /* INVALID */
```

You can also use a negative value for *`a`* in the expression, which
will effectively count backward from the term you use in *`b`*.
Selecting the first five list items in a list can be done like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:nth-child(-n + 5) {font-weight: bold;}
```

This works because negative `n` goes 0, --1, --2, --3, --4, and so on.
Add 5 to each of those, and you get 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and so on. Put in a
negative number for a multiplier on `n`, and you can get every second,
third, or whatever-number-you-want element, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:nth-child(-2n + 10) {font-weight: bold;}
```

That will select the 10th, 8th, 4th, and 2nd list items in a list.

As you might expect, a []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_nth_lastchild_pseudo
primary=":nth-last-child() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="nth-last-child() pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}corresponding pseudo-class is `:nth-last-child()`.
This lets you do the same thing as `:nth-child()`, except with
`:nth-last-child()` you start from the last element in a list of
siblings and count backward toward the beginning. If you're intent on
highlighting every other table row *and* making sure the very last row
is one of the rows in the highlighting pattern, either one of these will
work for you:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
tr:nth-last-child(odd) {background: silver;}
tr:nth-last-child(2n+1) {background: silver;} /* equivalent */
```

If the []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797105802928
primary="Document Object Model (DOM)"
secondary="pseudo-class selectors and" data-type="indexterm"}Document
Object Model (DOM) is updated to add or remove table rows, there is no
need to add or remove classes. By using structural selectors, these
selectors will always match the odd rows of the updated DOM.

Any element can be matched using both `:nth-child()` and
`:nth-last-child()` if it fits the criteria. Consider these rules, the
results of which are shown in
[Figure 3-12](#ch03.xhtml_combining_patterns_of_colon_nth-child_op){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:nth-child(3n + 3) {border-left: 5px solid black;}
li:nth-last-child(4n - 1) {border-right: 5px solid black; background: silver;}
```

Again, using negative terms for *`a`* will essentially count backward,
except since this pseudo-class is already counting from the end, a
negative term counts forward. That is to say, you can select the last
five list items in a list like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:nth-last-child(-n + 5) {font-weight: bold;}
```

###### Note {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_130}

An extension of `:nth-child()` and `:nth-last-child()` allows selecting
from among elements matched by a simple or compound selector; for
example, `:nth-child(2n + 1 of p.callout)`. As of early 2023, this is
supported in Safari and Chrome beta releases. With it being included in
Interop 2023, there are plans to have it fully supported in the near
future.

You also can []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797105668704
primary=":only-child pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="only-child pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}string
these two pseudo-classes together as `:nth-child(1):nth-last-child(1)`,
thus creating a more verbose restatement of `:only-child`. There's no
real reason to do so other than to create a selector with a higher
specificity (discussed in
[Chapter 4](../Text/ch04.xhtml#specificity_comma_inheritance){data-type="xref"}),
but the option is there.

You can use CSS to determine the number of items in a list and style
them accordingly:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:only-child {width: 100%;}
li:nth-child(1):nth-last-child(2),
li:nth-child(2):nth-last-child(1) {width: 50%;}
li:nth-child(1):nth-last-child(3),
li:nth-child(1):nth-last-child(3) ~ li {width: 33.33%;}
li:nth-child(1):nth-last-child(4),
li:nth-child(1):nth-last-child(4) ~ li {width: 25%;}
```

In these examples, if a list item is the only list item, the width is
100%. If a list item is the first item as well as the
second-from-the-last item, that means there are two items, and the width
is 50%. If an item is the first item as well as the third-from-the-last
item, we make it, and the two sibling list items following it, 33% wide.
Similarly, if a list item is the first item as well as the
fourth-from-the-last item, it means that there are exactly four items,
so we make it, and its three siblings, 25% of the width. (Note: this
sort of thing is a lot easier with the `:has()` pseudo-class, covered in
["The :has()
Pseudo-Class"](#ch03.xhtml_the_has_pseudo_class){data-type="xref"}.)[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797105590432

primary=":nth-last-of-type() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="nth-last-of-type() pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}may have become a familiar pattern, the
`:nth-child()` and `:nth-last-child()` pseudo-classes have analogues in
`:nth-of-type()` and `:nth-last-of-type()`. You can, for example, select
every other hyperlink that's a child of any given paragraph, starting
with the second, using `p > a:nth-of-type(even)`. This will ignore all
other elements (`<span>`, `<strong>`, etc.) and consider only the links,
as demonstrated in
[Figure 3-13](#ch03.xhtml_selecting_the_even-numbered_links){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p > a:nth-of-type(even) {background: blue; color: white;}

</span>Selecting the even-numbered links</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If you want to work from the last hyperlink backward, then you'd use
`p > a:nth-last-of-type(even)`.

As before, these pseudo-classes select elements of a type from among
their sibling elements, *not* from among all the elements of a type
within the entire document as a single group. Each element has its own
list of siblings, and selections happen within each group.

The difference between `:nth-of-type()` and `nth-child()` is that
`:nth-of-type()` counts the instances of whatever you're selecting, and
does its counting within that collection of elements. Take, for example,
the following markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<tr>
   <th scope="row">Count</th>
   <td>7</td>
   <td>6</td>
   <td>11</td>
   <td>17</td>
   <td>3</td>
   <td>21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>R</td>
   <td>X</td>
   <td>-</td>
   <td>C</td>
   <td>%</td>
   <td>A</td>
   <td>I</td>
</tr>
```

If you wanted to select every table cell in a row when it's in an
even-numbered column, you would use `td:nth-child(even)`. But if you
want to select every even-numbered instance of a table cell, that would
be `td:nth-of-type(even)`. You can see the difference in
[Figure 3-14](#ch03.xhtml_nth-child_and_nth-of-type){data-type="xref"},
which shows the result of the following CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
td:nth-child(even) {background: silver;}
td:nth-of-type(even) {text-decoration: underline;}

In the first row, every other table data cell (`td`) is selected,
starting with the first cell that comes after the table header cell
(`th`). In the second row, since all the cells are `td` cells, that
means all the cells in that row are of the same type and thus the
counting starts at the first cell.

With []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_loc_pseudo_class
primary="location pseudo-classes"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_ix_pseudo_class_loc
primary="pseudo-class selectors" secondary="location pseudo-classes"
data-type="indexterm"}the *location pseudo-classes*, we cross into the
territory of selectors that match pieces of a document based on
something in addition to the structure of the document---something that
cannot be precisely deduced simply by studying the document's markup.

This may sound like we're applying styles at random, but not so.
Instead, we're applying styles based on somewhat ephemeral conditions
that can't be predicted in advance. Nevertheless, the circumstances
under which the styles will appear are, in fact, well-defined.

Think of it this way: during a sporting event, whenever the home team
scores, the crowd will cheer. You don't know exactly when during a game
the team will score, but when it does, the crowd will cheer, just as
predicted. The fact that you can't predict the exact moment of the cheer
doesn't make it any less expected.

Now consider the anchor element (`<a>`), which (in HTML and related
languages) establishes a link from one document to another. Anchors are
always anchors, but some anchors refer to pages that have already been
visited, while others refer to pages that have yet to be visited. You
can't tell the difference by simply looking at the HTML markup, because
in the markup, all anchors look the same.

The only way to tell which links have been visited is by comparing the
links in a document to the user's browser history. So there are actually
two basic types of links: visited and unvisited.

describes the pseudo-classes you can apply to them.

For security reasons, the styles that can be applied to visited links are severely limited; see ["Visited Links and Privacy"](#ch03.xhtml_visited_links_and_privacy){data-type="xref"} for details.
  `:any-link`                  Refers[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797105279552 primary=":any-link pseudo-class" primary-sortas="any-link pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797105278544 primary="links" secondary=":any-link pseudo-class" secondary-sortas="any-link pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"} to any element that would be matched by either `:link` or `:visited`.

One example would be skip-links within a document. *Note: not supported as of early 2023.*

  : [Table 3-1. ]{.label}Link pseudo-classes {#link_pseudo-classes}

The first of the pseudo-classes in
[Table 3-1](#ch03.xhtml_link_pseudo-classes){data-type="xref"} may seem
a bit redundant. After all, if an anchor hasn't been visited, it must be
unvisited, right? If that's the case, all we should need is the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a {color: blue;}
a:visited {color: red;}
```

Although this format seems reasonable, it's not quite enough. The first
of the rules shown here applies not only to unvisited links, but also to
any `<a>` element, even those without an `href` attribute such as this
one:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<a id="section004">4. The Lives of Meerkats</a>
```

The resulting text would be blue, because the `<a>` element will match
the rule `a {color`: `blue;}`. Therefore, to avoid applying your link
styles to placeholder links, use the `:link` and `:visited`
pseudo-classes:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link {color: blue;}    /* unvisited links are blue */
a:visited {color: red;}   /* visited links are red */
```

This is a good place to revisit attribute and class selectors and show
how they can be combined with pseudo-classes. For example, let's say you
want to change the color of links that point outside your own site. In
most circumstances, we can use the starts-with attribute selector.
However, some CMSs set all links to be absolute URLs, in which case you
could assign a class to each of these anchors. It's easy:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<a href="/about.xhtml">My About page</a>
<a href="https://www.site.net/" class="external">An external site</a>
```

To apply different styles to the external link, all you need is a rule
like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a.external:link, a[href^="http"]:link { color: slateblue;}
a.external:visited, a[href^="http"]:visited  {color: maroon;}
```

This rule will make the second anchor in the preceding markup slate blue
by default and maroon once visited, while the first anchor will remain
the default color for hyperlinks (usually blue when not visited and
purple once visited). For improved usability and accessibility, visited
links should be easily distinguished from unvisited links.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104993152
primary="Document Object Model (DOM)" secondary="visited links and"
data-type="indexterm"}well over a decade, it was possible to style
visited links with any CSS properties available, just as you could
unvisited links. However, in the mid-2000s several people demonstrated
that visual styling and simple DOM scripting could be used to determine
if a user had visited a given page.

For example, given the rule `:visited {font-weight: bold;}`, a script
could find all of the boldfaced links and tell the user which of those
sites they'd visited---or, worse still, report those sites back to a
server. A similar, nonscripted tactic uses background images to achieve
the same result.

While this might not seem terribly serious, it can be utterly
devastating for a web user in a country that jails people for visiting
certain sites---opposition parties, unsanctioned religious
organizations, "immoral" or "corrupting" sites, and so on. These
techniques can also be used by phishing sites to determine which online
banks a user has visited. Thus, two steps were taken.

The first step is that only color-related properties can be applied to
visited links: `color`, `background-color`, `column-rule-color`,
`outline-color`, `border-color`, and the individual-side border color
properties (e.g., `border-top-color`). Attempts to apply any other
property to a visited link will be ignored. Furthermore, any styles
defined for `:link` will be applied to visited links as well as
unvisited links, which effectively makes `:link` "style any hyperlink,"
instead of "style any unvisited [hyperlink."]{.keep-together}

The second step is that if a visited link has its styles queried via the
DOM, the resulting value will be as if the link were not visited. Thus,
if you've defined visited links to be purple rather than unvisited
links' blue, even though the link will appear purple onscreen, a DOM
query of its color will return the blue value, not the purple one.

This behavior is present throughout all browsing modes, not just
"private browsing" modes. Even though we're limited in how we can use
CSS to differentiate visited links from unvisited links, it is important
for usability and accessibility to use the limited styles supported by
visited links to differentiate them from unvisited
links.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104985440 primary=""

### Nonhyperlink location pseudo-classes {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_139}

Hyperlinks aren't the only []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_nonhyper_pseudo
primary="non-hyperlink location pseudo-classes"
data-type="indexterm"}elements that can be related to location. CSS also
provides a few pseudo-classes that relate to the targets of hyperlinks,
summarized in
[Table 3-2](#ch03.xhtml_non_link_pseudo-classes){data-type="xref"}.

  `:target`          Refers[]{#ch03.xhtml_ix_target_pseudo primary=":target pseudo-class" primary-sortas="target pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"} to an element whose `id` attribute value matches the fragment selector in the URL used to load the page---that is, the element specifically targeted by the URL.
  `:target-within`   Refers[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104951584 primary=":target-within pseudo-class" primary-sortas="target-within pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"} to an element that is the target of the URL, or that contains an element that is so targeted. *Note: not supported as of early 2023.*
  `:scope`           Refers[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104948384 primary=":scope pseudo-class" primary-sortas="scope pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"} to elements that are a reference point for selector matching.

  : [Table 3-2. ]{.label}Nonlink location pseudo-classes
  {#non_link_pseudo-classes}

Let's talk about target selection. []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104946432
primary="fragment identifier" data-type="indexterm"}When a URL includes
a fragment identifier, the piece of the document at which it points is
called (in CSS) the *target*. Thus, you can uniquely style any element
that is the target of a URL fragment identifier with the `:target`
pseudo-class.

Even if you're unfamiliar with the term *fragment identifier*, you've
probably seen them in action. Consider this URL:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#target-pseudo
```

The `target-pseudo` portion of the URL is the fragment identifier, which
is marked by the `#` symbol. If the referenced page
(*http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/*) has an element with an ID of
`target-pseudo`, that element becomes the target of the fragment
identifier.

Thanks to `:target`, you can highlight any targeted element within a
document, or you can devise different styles for various types of
elements that might be targeted---say, one style for targeted headings,
another for targeted tables, and so on.
[Figure 3-15](#ch03.xhtml_styling_a_fragment_identifier_target){data-type="xref"}
shows an example of `:target` in action:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*:target {border-left: 5px solid gray; background: yellow url(target.png)
    top right no-repeat;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch03.xhtml_styling_a_fragment_identifier_target"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0315.png" width="600" height="252"
alt="css5 0315" />
<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_140"><span class="label">Figure 3-15.
</span>Styling a fragment identifier target</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The `:target` styles will not be applied in three circumstances:

-   The page is accessed via a URL that does not have a fragment
    identifier.

-   The page is accessed via a URL that has a fragment identifier, but
    the identifier does not match any elements within the document.

-   The page's URL is updated in such a way that a scroll state is not
    created, which happens most often via JS shenanigans. (This isn't a
    CSS rule, but it is how browsers behave.)

More interestingly, though, what happens if multiple elements within a
document can be matched by the fragment identifier---for example, if the
author erroneously includes three separate instances of
`<div id="target-pseudo">` in the same document?

The short answer is that CSS doesn't have or need rules to cover this
case, because all CSS is concerned with is styling targets. Whether the
browser picks just one of the three elements to be the target or
designates all three as coequal targets, `:target` styles should be
applied to anything that is a valid
target.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104871472 primary=""
startref="ix_target_pseudo" data-type="indexterm"}

Closely []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104869888
primary=":target-within pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="target-within pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}related to the `:target` pseudo-class is the
`:target-within` pseudo-class. The difference is that `:target-within`
will match not only elements that are targets, but also elements that
are the ancestors of targets. Thus, the following CSS would match any
`<p>` element containing a target, or that was itself a target:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p:target-within {border-left: 5px solid gray; background: yellow url(target.png)
    top right no-repeat;}
```

Or it would, anyway, if any browser supported it. As of early 2023, this
is not the case.

Finally, we consider the `:scope` pseudo-class. This is quite widely
supported, but at present, it comes in handy only in scripting
situations. Consider the following JS and HTML, which we'll explain
after the code:

``` {code-language="js" data-type="programlisting"}
var output = document.getElementById('output');
var registers = output.querySelectorAll(':scope > div');
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<section id="output">
  <h3>Results</h3>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
</section>
```

The JS portion says, in effect, "Find the element with an ID of
`output`. Then, find all the `<div>` elements that are children of the
`output` element you just found." (Yes, CSS selectors can be used in
JS!) The `:scope` in that bit of JS refers to the scope of the thing
that had been found, thus keeping the selection confined to just that
instead of the whole document. The result is that, in the JS program's
memory, it now has a structure holding references to the two `<div>`
elements in the HTML.

If you []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096709536 primary=":scope pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="scope pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}use `:scope`
in straight CSS, it will refer to the *scoping root*, which (at present)
means the `<html>` element, assuming the document is HTML.
[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096707152 primary="scoping root"
data-type="indexterm"}Neither HTML nor CSS provides a way to set scoping
roots other than the root element of the document. So, outside of JS,
`:scope` is essentially equivalent to `:root`. That may change in the
future, but for now, you should use `:scope` only in JS contexts.

# JS and CSS {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_141}

CSS has []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096674816
primary="JavaScript, CSS influence on" data-type="indexterm"}influenced
the evolution of JS in a few ways, and one is the ability to use the CSS
selection engine from within JS via `.querySelectorAll()`. This method
can take any CSS selector as a string, and will return a collection of
all the elements within the DOM that are matched by the selector. The
`.querySelector()` method also accepts any CSS selector as a string, but
will return only the first element found, so it's not always as useful.

You may come across older JS methods for collecting elements, such as
`.getElementByID()` and `.getElementsByTagName()`. These are from the
time before `.querySelectorAll()` was added to JS, and while they may be
marginally more performant than `.querySelectorAll()` in some
situations, they're mostly found in legacy codebases these days. Both
are now more simply handled with `.querySelectorAll()`. For example, the
following two lines would have almost the same result:

``` {code-language="javascript" data-type="programlisting"}
var subheads = Document.getElementsByTagName('h2');
var subheads = Document.querySelectorAll('h2');
```

Similarly, a `.getElementById('summary')` can be equivalently replaced
with `.querySelectorAll('#summary')`.

The advantage in `.querySelectorAll()` is that it can take any selector,
no matter how complex, including grouped selectors. Thus, you could get
all of the level-two and [-three]{.keep-together} headings in a single
call: `Document.querySelectorAll('h2, h3')`. Or you could grab a more
complex set of elements with something like
`.querySelectorAll('h2 + p, pre + p, table + *, thead th:nth-child(even)')`.

Note, though, that the list of elements returned by
`.querySelectorAll()` is static, and therefore is not updated when the
DOM is dynamically changed. If another part of the JS adds a section
with an `<h2>` element in it, the elements previously collected with
`.querySelectorAll('h2, h3')` will *not* be updated to include the newly
added `<h2>`. You'd need to either add it yourself manually or do a new
`.querySelectorAll()` call.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096643376 primary=""

Elements that can become `:active` or have `:focus` include links,

interactive elements, including form controls and elements containing
content that can be edited (by having the attribute, `contenteditable`,
added to the element's opening tag).

As with `:link` and `:visited`, these pseudo-classes are most familiar
in the context of hyperlinks. Many web pages have styles that look like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

The order of the pseudo-classes is more important than it might seem at
first. The usual recommendation is `link`, `visited`, `focus`, `hover`,
and `active`. The next chapter explains why this particular order is
important and discusses several reasons you might choose to change or
even ignore the recommendation.
:::

Notice that the dynamic pseudo-classes can be applied to any element,
which is good since it's often useful to apply dynamic styles to
elements that aren't links. Consider this example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input:focus {background: silver; font-weight: bold;}
```

By using this markup, you could highlight a form element that is ready
to accept keyboard input, as shown in
[Figure 3-16](#ch03.xhtml_highlighting_a_form_element_that_has_foc){data-type="xref"}.

Two []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096499456
primary=":focus-visible pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="focus-visible pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}relatively new additions to the user-action
pseudo-classes are `:focus-within` and `:focus-visible`. Let's take the
second one first.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="The :focus-visible pseudo-class" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096497424 .sect3}
### The :focus-visible pseudo-class {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_145}

The `:focus-visible` class is very much like `:focus` in that it applies
to elements that have focus, but there's a big difference: it will match
only if the element that has focus is an element that the user agent
thinks should be given visible focus styles in a given situation.

For example, consider HTML buttons. When a button is clicked via a
mouse, that button is given focus, the same as if we had used a keyboard
interface to move the focus to it. As authors who care about
accessibility and aesthetics, we want the button to have focus when it's
focused via the keyboard or another assistive technology, but we might
not like it getting focus styles when it's clicked or tapped.

We can split this difference by using CSS such as the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
button:focus-visible {outline: 5px solid maroon;}
```

This will put a thick dark-red outline around the button when tabbing to
it via keyboard, but the rule won't be applied when the button is
clicked with the mouse.

we'll get the result shown in

```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

The third link currently has focus, having received it by the user
tabbing to that link, and is styled with a 2-pixel outline. The `<nav>`
element that contains it is also being given focus styling via
`:focus-within`, because an element within itself (that is, an element
descended from it) currently has focus. This adds a little more visual
weight to that area of the page, which can be helpful. Be careful of
overdoing it, though. Too many focus styles can create visual overload,
potentially confusing users.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_148}

While you can style elements with `:focus` any way you like, do *not*
remove all styling from focused elements. Differentiating which element
currently has focus is vital for accessibility, especially for those
navigating your site or application with a keyboard.

Although the state of a UI element can certainly be changed by user

because they can also be affected by the document structure or
scripting.

primary="Document Object Model (DOM)" secondary="disabling UI elements"
data-type="indexterm"}DOM scripting and HTML, you can mark a UI element
(or group of UI elements) as being disabled. A disabled element is
displayed but cannot be selected, activated, or otherwise interacted
with by the user. Authors can set an element to be disabled either
through DOM scripting or by adding a `disabled` attribute to the
element's markup.

Any element that can be disabled, but hasn't been, is by definition
enabled. You can style these two states by using the `:enabled` and
`:disabled` pseudo-classes. It's much more common to style disabled
elements and leave enabled elements alone, but both have their uses, as
illustrated in

### Check states {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_154}

In []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096211248 primary=":checked pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="checked pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}addition to
being enabled or disabled, certain UI elements can be checked or
unchecked---in HTML, the input types `checkbox` and `radio` fit this
definition. CSS offers a `:checked` pseudo-class to handle elements in
that state. In []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096208736
primary=":indeterminate pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="indeterminate pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}addition, the `:indeterminate` pseudo-class
matches any checkable UI element that is neither checked nor unchecked.
These states are illustrated in
[Figure 3-20](#ch03.xhtml_styling_checked_and_indeterminate_ui_ele){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:checked {background: silver;}
:indeterminate {border: red;}
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch03.xhtml_styling_checked_and_indeterminate_ui_ele"

<img src="./images/css5_0320.png" width="212" height="16"

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_155"><span class="label">Figure 3-20.
</span>Styling checked and indeterminate UI elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Although checkable elements are unchecked by default, an HTML author can
toggle them on by adding the `checked` attribute to an element's markup.
An author can also use DOM scripting to flip an element's checked state
to checked or unchecked, whichever they [prefer.]{.keep-together}

As of early 2023, the indeterminate state can be set only through DOM
scripting or by the user agent itself; no markup-level method exists to
set elements to an indeterminate state. The purpose of styling an
indeterminate state is to visually indicate that the element needs to be
checked (or unchecked) by the user. However, this is purely a visual
effect: it does not affect the underlying state of the UI element, which
is either checked or unchecked, depending on document markup and the
effects of any DOM scripting.

Although the previous examples show styled radio buttons, remember that
direct styling of radio buttons and checkboxes with CSS is actually very
limited. Nevertheless, that shouldn't limit your use of the
selected-option pseudo-classes. As an example, you can style the labels
associated with your checkboxes and radio buttons by using a combination
of `:checked` and the adjacent sibling combinator:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input[type="checkbox"]:checked + label {
  color: red;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<input id="chbx" type="checkbox"> <label for="chbx">I am a label</label>
```

If you need to select all checkboxes that are not checked, use the
negation pseudo-class (which is covered later in the chapter) like this:
`input[type="checkbox"]:not(:checked)`. Only radio buttons and
checkboxes can be checked. Note that every element, and these two when
not checked, are `:not(:checked)`. This approach does not fill the gap
left by the absence of an `:unchecked` pseudo-class, and such a
pseudo-class should match only elements that should be checkable.

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Default-value pseudo-classes" data-type="sect3"}
:::: {#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096212848 .sect3}
### Default-value pseudo-classes {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_156}

Three []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797096066016 primary=":default pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="default pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-classes relate to default values and filler
text: `:default`, `:placeholder-shown`, and `:autofill`.

The `:default` pseudo-class matches the UI elements that are the default
among a set of similar elements. This typically applies to context menu
items, buttons, and select lists/menus. If there are several same-named
radio buttons, the one that was originally selected (if any) matches
`:default`, even if the UI has been updated by the user so that it no
longer matches `:checked`. If a checkbox was checked on page load,
`:default` matches it. Any initially selected option(s) in a `select`
element will match:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
[type="checkbox"]:default + label { font-style: italic; }
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<input type="checkbox" id="chbx" checked name="foo" value="bar">
<label for="chbx">This was checked on page load</label>
```

The `:default` pseudo-class will also match a form's default button,
which is generally the first `button` element in DOM order that is a
member of a given form. This could be used to indicate to users which
button will be activated if they just hit Enter, instead of explicitly
selecting a button to activate.

The `:placeholder-shown` []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797095975184
primary=":placeholder-shown pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="placeholder-shown pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-class is similar in that it will select any
input that has placeholder text defined at the markup level while that
placeholder text is visible. The placeholder is no longer shown when the
input has a value. For example:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<input type="text" id="firstName" placeholder="Your first name">
<input type="text" id="lastName"  placeholder="Your last name">
```

By default, the value of a `placeholder` attribute will be placed into
the input fields in a browser, usually in a lighter color than normal
text. If you want to style those input elements in a consistent way, you
can do something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input:placeholder-shown {opacity: 0.75;}
```

This selects the input as a whole, not the placeholder text. (To style
the placeholder text itself, see ["The Placeholder Text
Pseudo-Element"](#ch03.xhtml_the_placeholder_text_pseudo){data-type="xref"}.)

The `:autofill` []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797095928064
primary=":autofill pseudo-class" primary-sortas="autofill pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-class is a little bit different from the
other two: it matches any element that has had its value automatically
filled in or auto-completed by the browser. This may be familiar to you
if you've ever filled out a form by having the browser fill in stored
values of your name, email, mailing address, and so on. The input fields
that are filled in usually get a distinct style, like a yellowish
background. You can add to that using `:autofill`, perhaps like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input:autofill {border: thick solid maroon;}
```

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_157}

While you can add to default browser styling of autofilled text,
overriding the browser's built-in styles for things such as background
colors is difficult. This is because the browsers' styles for autofilled
fields are set to override just about anything else, largely as a way to
provide users with a consistent experience of autofilled content and to
protect the user.

### Optionality pseudo-classes {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_158}

The `:required` []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797095845760
primary=":optional pseudo-class" primary-sortas="optional pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797095844752
primary=":required pseudo-class" primary-sortas="required pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-class matches any user-input element that
is required, as denoted by the presence of the `required` attribute. The
`:optional` pseudo-class matches user-input elements that do not have
the `required` attribute, or whose `required` attribute has a value of
`false`.

A user-input element is `:required` if the user must provide a value for
before submitting the form to which it belongs. All other user-input
elements are matched by `:optional`. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input:required { border: 1px solid #f00;}
input:optional { border: 1px solid #ccc;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<input type="email" placeholder="enter an email address" required>
<input type="email" placeholder="optional email address">
<input type="email" placeholder="optional email address" required="false">
```

The first email input will match the `:required` pseudo-class because of
the presence of the `required` attribute. The second input is optional
and therefore will match the `:optional` pseudo-class. The same is true
for the third input, which has a `required` attribute, but the value is
`false`.

Elements that are not user-input elements can be neither required nor
optional. Including the `required` attribute on a non-user-input element
won't lead to an optionality pseudo-class match.

::: {#ch03.xhtml_idm45797095803136 .sect3}
### Validity pseudo-classes {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_159}

The `:valid` []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797095801120
primary=":valid pseudo-class" primary-sortas="valid pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-class refers to a user input that meets all
of its data validity requirements. The `:invalid` pseudo-class, on the
other hand, refers to a user input that does not meet all of its data
validity requirements.

The validity pseudo-classes `:valid` and `:invalid` apply only to
elements having the capacity for data validity requirements: a `<div>`
will never match either selector, but an `<input>` could match either,
depending on the current state of the interface.

In the following example, an image is dropped into the background of any
email input that has focus, with one image being used when the input is
invalid and another used when the input is valid, as illustrated in
[Figure 3-21](#ch03.xhtml_styling_valid_and_invalid_inputs){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input[type="email"]:focus {
  background-position: 100% 50%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
input[type="email"]:focus:invalid {
  background-image: url(warning.jpg);
}
input[type="email"]:focus:valid {
  background-image: url(checkmark.jpg);

Keep in mind that these pseudo-class states may not act as you might
expect. For example, as of late 2022, any empty email input that isn't
required matches `:valid`. Even though a null input is not a valid email
address, failing to enter an email address is a valid response for an
optional input. If you try to fill in a malformed address or just some
random text, that will be matched by `:invalid` because it isn't a valid
email address.

primary=":in-range pseudo-class" primary-sortas="in-range pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}range pseudo-classes include `:in-range`, which
refers to a user input whose value is between the minimum and maximum
values set by HTML's `min` and `max` attributes, and `:out-of-range`,
which refers to a user input whose value is below the minimum or above
the maximum values allowed by the control.

For example, consider a number input that accepts numbers in the range 0
to 1,000:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input[type="number"]:focus {
  background-position: 100% 50%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
input[type="number"]:focus:out-of-range {
  background-image: url(warning.jpg);
}
input[type="number"]:focus:in-range {
  background-image: url(checkmark.jpg);
}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<input id="grams" type="number" min="0" max="1000" />
```

In this example, a value from 0 to 1,000, inclusive, would mean the
`input` element is matched by `:in-range`. Any value outside that range,
whether input by the user or assigned via the DOM, will cause the
`input` to match `:out-of-range` instead.

The `:in-range` and `:out-of-range` pseudo-classes apply *only* to
elements with range limitations. User inputs that don't have range
limitations, like links for inputs of type `tel`, will not be matched by
either pseudo-class.

HTML also has a `step` attribute. If a value is invalid because it does
not match the `step` value, but is still between or equal to the `min`
and `max` values, it will match `:invalid` while *also* still matching
`:in-range`. A value can be in range while also being invalid.

Thus, in the following scenario, the input's value will be both red and
boldfaced, because the value `23` is in range but is not evenly
divisible by 10:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input[type="number"]:invalid {color: red;}
input[type="number"]:in-range {font-weight: bold;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<input id="by-tens" type="number" min="0" max="1000" step="10" value="23" />
```

primary="mutability pseudo-classes" data-type="indexterm"}mutability
pseudo-classes include `:read-write`, which refers to a user input that
is editable by the user; and `:read-only`, which matches user inputs
that are not editable, including radio buttons and checkboxes. Only
elements that can have their values altered by user input can match
`:read-write`.

For example, in HTML, a nondisabled, non-read-only `input` element is
`:read-write`, as is any element with the `contenteditable` attribute.
Everything else matches `:read-only`.

By default, neither of the following rules would ever match, because
`<textarea>` elements are read-write, and `<pre>` elements are
read-only:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
textarea:read-only {opacity: 0.75;}
pre:read-write:hover {border: 1px dashed green;}
```

However, each can be made to match as follows:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<textarea disabled></textarea>
<pre contenteditable>Type your own code!</pre>
```

Because `<textarea>` is given a `disabled` attribute, it becomes
read-only, and so will have the first rule apply. Similarly, the `<pre>`
here has been made editable via the `contenteditable` attribute, so now
it is a read-write element. This will be matched by the second
rule.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110536288 primary=""

## The :lang() and :dir() Pseudo-Classes {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_163}

When you want to []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110532592
primary=":lang() pseudo-class" primary-sortas="lang() pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}select an element based on its language, you can
use the `:lang()` pseudo-class. In terms of its matching patterns, this
pseudo-class is similar to the `|=` attribute selector (see ["Selection
Based on Partial Attribute
Values"](../Text/ch02.xhtml#selection_based_on_partial_attribute_val){data-type="xref"}).
For example, to italicize elements whose content is written in French,
you could write either of the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*:lang(fr) {font-style: italic;}
*[lang|="fr"] {font-style: italic;}
```

The []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110479648 primary="lang attribute, HTML"
data-type="indexterm"}primary difference between the pseudo-class
selector and the attribute selector is that language information can be
derived from multiple sources, some of which are outside the element
itself. For the attribute selector, the element must have the attribute
present to match. The `:lang()` pseudo-class, on the other hand, matches
descendants of an element with the language declaration. As [Selectors
Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#lang-pseudo) states:

> In HTML, the language is determined by a combination of the `lang`
> attribute, and possibly information from the `meta` elements and the
> protocol (such as HTTP headers). XML uses an attribute called
> `xml:lang`, and there may be other document language-specific methods
> for determining the language.

The pseudo-class will operate on all of that information, whereas the
attribute selector can work only if a `lang` attribute is present in the
element's markup. Therefore, the pseudo-class is more robust than the
attribute selector and is probably a better choice in most cases where
language-specific styling is needed.

CSS []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110457024 primary=":dir() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="dir() pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}also has a
`:dir()` pseudo-class, which selects elements based on the HTML
direction of an element. So you could, for example, select all the
elements whose direction is right to left like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*:dir(rtl) {border-right: 2px solid;}
```

The []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110449808 primary="direction property"
data-type="indexterm"}thing to watch out for here is that the `:dir()`
pseudo-class selects elements based on their directionality in HTML, and
not the value of the `direction` property in CSS that may be applied to
them. Thus, the only two values you can really use for selection are
`ltr` (left to right) and `rtl` (right to left) because those are the
only direction values that HTML supports.

:::: {#ch03.xhtml_the_negation_pseudo-class .sect3}
### The negation pseudo-class {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_165}

Every []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_neg_pseudo primary="negation pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}selector we've covered thus far has had one thing
in common: they're all positive selectors. They are used to identify the
things that should be selected, thus excluding by implication all the
things that don't match and are thus not selected.

For []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_not_pseudo primary=":not() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="not() pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}those times
when you want to invert this formulation and select elements based on
what they are *not*, CSS provides the negation pseudo-class, `:not()`.
It's not quite like any other selector, fittingly enough, and it does
have some restrictions on its use, but let's start with an example.

Let us suppose you want to apply a style to every list item that does
not have a `class` of `moreinfo`, as illustrated in
[Figure 3-22](#ch03.xhtml_styling_list_items_that_donat_have_a_cer){data-type="xref"}.
That used to be very difficult, and in certain cases impossible, to make
happen. Now we can declare the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:not(.moreinfo) {font-style: italic;}
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch03.xhtml_styling_list_items_that_donat_have_a_cer"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0322.png" width="600" height="315"

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_166"><span class="label">Figure 3-22.
</span>Styling list items that don’t have a certain class</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The way `:not()` works is that you attach it to a selector, and then in
the parentheses you fill in a selector or group of selectors describing
what the original selector cannot match.

Let's flip around the previous example and select all elements with a
class of `moreinfo` that are not list items. This is illustrated in
[Figure 3-23](#ch03.xhtml_styling_elements_with_a_certain_class_th){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.moreinfo:not(li) {font-style: italic;}
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch03.xhtml_styling_elements_with_a_certain_class_th"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0323.png" width="600" height="181"
alt="css5 0323" />
<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_167"><span class="label">Figure 3-23.
</span>Styling elements with a certain class that aren’t list items</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Translated into English, the selector would say, "Select all elements
with a class whose value contains the word `moreinfo` as long as they
are not `<li>` elements." Similarly, the translation of
`li:not(.moreinfo)` would be, "Select all `<li>` elements as long as
they do not have a class whose value contains the word `moreinfo`."

You can also use the negation pseudo-class at any point in a more
complex selector. Thus, to select all tables that are not children of a
`<section>` element, you would write `*:not(section) > table`.
Similarly, to select table header cells that are not part of the table
header, you'd write something like `table *:not(thead) > tr > th`, with
a result like that shown in
[Figure 3-24](#ch03.xhtml_styling_table_cells_that_arenat_in_the_t){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_168"><span class="label">Figure 3-24.
</span>Styling header cells outside the table’s head area</h6>
</div>
</figure>

What you cannot do is nest negation pseudo-classes; thus,
`p:not(:not(p))` is not valid and will be ignored. It's also, logically,
the equivalent of just writing `p`, so there's no point anyway.
Furthermore, you cannot reference pseudo-elements (which we'll cover
shortly) inside the parentheses.

Technically, you can put a []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110319568
primary="selectors" secondary="universal"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110318592
primary="asterisk (*)" secondary="universal selector"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110317648
primary="* (asterisk)" secondary="universal selector"
data-type="indexterm"}universal selector into the parentheses, but
there's little point. After all, `p:not(*)` would mean "select any `<p>`
element as long as it isn't any element," and there's no such thing as
an element that is not an element. Similarly, `p:not(p)` would also
select nothing. It's also possible to write things like `p:not(div)`,
which will select any `<p>` element that is not a `<div>` element---in
other words, all of them. Again, there is little reason to do this.

On the other hand, it's possible to chain negations together to create a
sort of "and also not this" effect. For example, you might want to
select all elements with a class of `link` that are neither list items
nor paragraphs:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*.link:not(li):not(p) {font-style: italic;}
```

That translates to "select all elements with a class whose value
contains the word `link` as long as they are neither `<li>` nor `<p>`
elements." This used to be the only way to exclude a group of elements,
but CSS (and browsers) support selector lists in negations. That allows
us to rewrite the previous example like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*.link:not(li, p) {font-style: italic;}
```

Along with this came the ability to use more complex selectors, such as
those using descendant combinators. If you need to select all elements
that are descended from a `<form>` element but do not immediately follow
a `<p>` element, you could write it as [follows:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
form *:not(p + *)
```

Translated, that's "select any element that is not the adjacent sibling
`<p>` element, and is also the descendant of a `<form>` element." And
you can put these into groups, so if you also want to exclude list items
and table-header cells, it would go something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
form *:not(p + *, li, thead > tr > th)
```

The ability to use complex selectors in `:not()` came to browsers in
only early 2021, so exercise caution when using it, especially in
[legacy settings.]{.keep-together}
:::

One thing to watch out for with `:not()` is that in some situations
rules can combine in unexpected ways, mostly because we're not used to
thinking of selection in the negative. Consider this test case:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div:not(.one) p {font-weight: normal;}
div.one p {font-weight: bold;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div class="one">
   <div class="two">
      <p>I'm a paragraph!</p>
   </div>
</div>
```

The paragraph will be boldfaced, not normal weight. This is because both
rules match: the `<p>` element is descended from a `<div>` whose class
does not contain the word `one` (`<div class="two">`), but it is *also*
descended from a `<div>` whose class contains the word `one`. Both rules
match, so both apply. Since a conflict exists, the cascade (which is
explained in
[Chapter 4](../Text/ch04.xhtml#specificity_comma_inheritance){data-type="xref"})
is used to resolve the conflict, and the second rule wins. The
structural arrangement of the markup, with the `div.two` being "closer"
to the paragraph than `div.one`, is
irrelevant.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797110055904 primary=""

### The :is() and :where() pseudo-classes {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_170}

CSS has two []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_where_pseudo_class
primary=":where() pseudo-class" primary-sortas="where() pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_ix_is_pseudo_class
primary=":is() pseudo-class" primary-sortas="is() pseudo-class"
data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-classes that allow for group matching
within a complex selector, `:is()` and `:where()`. These are almost
identical to each other, with just a minor difference that we'll cover
once you understand how they work. Let's start with `:is()`.

Suppose you want to select all list items, whether or not they are part
of an ordered or an unordered list. The traditional way to do that is
shown here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol li, ul li {font-style: italic;}
```

With `:is()`, we can rewrite that like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:is(ol, ul) li {font-style: italic;}
```

The matched elements will be exactly the same: all list items that are
part of either ordered or unordered lists.

This might seem slightly pointless: the syntax is not only slightly less
clear, but also one character longer. And it's true that in simple
situations like that, `:is()` isn't terribly compelling. The more
complex the situation, though, the more likely `:is()` will really
shine.

For example, what if we want to style all list items that are at least
two levels deep in nested lists, no matter what combination of ordered
and unordered lists are above them? Compare the following rules, both of
which will have the effect shown in
[Figure 3-25](#ch03.xhtml_using_matches_any_to_select){data-type="xref"},
except one uses the traditional approach and the other uses `:is()`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol ol li, ol ul li, ul ol li, ul ul li {font-style: italic;}

:is(ol, ul) :is(ol, ul) li {font-style: italic;}
```

</span>Using <code>:is()</code> to select elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now consider what the traditional approach would look like for three,
four, or even more levels deep of nested lists!

The `:is()` pseudo-class can be used in all sorts of situations;
selecting all links inside lists that are themselves inside headers,
footers, and `<nav>` elements could look like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:is(header,footer,nav,#header,#footer) :is(ol,ul) a[href] {font-style: italic;}
```

Even better: the list of []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797109879232
primary="forgiving selector list" data-type="indexterm"}selectors inside
`:is()` is what's called a *forgiving selector list*. By default, if any
one thing in a selector is invalid, the whole rule is marked invalid.
Forgiving selector lists, on the other hand, will throw any part that's
invalid and honor the rest.

So, given all that, what's the difference between `:is()` and
`:where()`? The sole difference is that `:is()` takes the specificity of
the most-specific selector in its selector list, whereas `:where()` has
zero specificity. If that last sentence didn't make sense to you, don't
worry! We haven't discussed specificity yet but will in the next
chapter.

### Selecting defined elements {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_173}

As the web has advanced, it's added more and more capabilities. One of
the more recent is the ability to add custom HTML elements to your
markup in a standardized way. This happens a lot with pattern libraries,
which often define Web Components based on elements that are specific to
the library.

One thing such libraries do to be more efficient is hold off on defining
an element until it's needed, or it's ready to be populated with
whatever content is supposed to go into it. Such a custom element might
look like this in markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<mylib-combobox>options go here</mylib-combobox>
```

The actual goal is to fill that combobox (a drop-down list that also
allows users to enter arbitrary values) with whatever options the
backend CMS provides for it, downloaded via a script that requests the
latest data in order to build the list locally, and removing the
placeholder text in the process. However, what happens if the server
fails to respond, leaving the custom element undefined and stuck with
its placeholder text? Without taking steps, the text "options go here"
will get inserted into the page, probably with minimal styling.

Imagine you want to apply special styles to any `<div>` element that
contains an image. In other words, if a `<div>` element *has* an `<img>`
element inside it, you want to apply certain styles to the `<div>`. And
that's exactly what `:has()` makes possible.

The previous example would be written something like this, with the
result illustrated in
[Figure 3-26](#ch03.xhtml_using_has_to_select_elements){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div:has(img) {
	border: 3px double gray;
}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>
   <img src="masthead.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div>
   <p>No image here!</p>
</div>

</span>Using <code>:has()</code> to select elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The second `<div>`, which does not have an `<img>` element as a
descendant, doesn't get the border. If you wanted only the first `<div>`
to get the border, because you actually wanted to style only `<div>`
elements that have images as direct children, just modify the selector
to use the child combinator, like this: `div:has(> img)`. That would
prevent the third `<div>` from getting the border.

The `:has()` pseudo-class is, in one real sense, the mythical "parent
selector" CSS authors have wished for since the beginning of CSS itself.
Except it isn't just for parent selection, because you can select based
on siblings, or make the selection happen as far up the ancestry chain
as you like. And if all that didn't quite make sense to you, hang on:
we'll explain further.

We have two facts to note right off the bat:

-   Inside the parentheses of `:has()`, you can provide a
    comma-separated list of selectors, and each of those selectors can
    be simple, compound, or complex.

-   Those selectors are considered relative to the anchor element, the
    element to which `:has()` is attached.

Let's take those in order. All of the following are valid `:has()` uses:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
table:has(tbody th) {…}
/* tables whose body contains table headers */

a:any-link:has(img:only-child) {…}
/* links containing only an image */

header:has(nav, form.search) {…}
/* headers containing either nav or a form classed search */

section:has(+ h2 em, table + table, ol ul ol ol) {…}
/* sections immediately followed by an 'h2' that contains an 'em'
   OR that contain a table immediately followed by another table
   OR that contain an 'ol' inside an 'ol' inside a 'ul' inside an 'ol' */
```

That last example might be a bit overwhelming, so let's break it down a
bit further. We could restate in a longer way, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section:has(+ h2 em),
section:has(table + table),
section:has(ol ul ol ol) {…}
```

And here are two examples of the markup patterns that would be selected:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<section>(…section content…)</section>
<h2>I’m an h2 with an <em>emphasis element</em> inside, which means
    the section right before me gets selected!</h2>

<section>
<h2>This h2 doesn’t get the section selected, because it’s a child of
    the section, not its immediately following sibling</h2>
<p>This paragraph is just here.</p>
<aside>
<h3>Q1 Results</h3>
<table>(…table contents…)</table>
<table>(…table contents…)</table>
</aside>
<p>Those adjacent-sibling tables mean this paragraph’s parent section element
   DOES get selected!</p>
</section>
```

In the first example, the selection isn't based on parentage or any
other ancestry; instead, the `<section>` is selected because its
immediate sibling (the `<h2>`) has an `<em>` element as one of its
descendants. In the second, the `<section>` is selected because it has a
descendant `<table>` that's immediately followed by another `<table>`,
both of which happen in this case to be inside an `<aside>` element.
That makes this specific example one of grandparent selection, not
parent selection, because the `<section>` is a grandparent to the
tables.

Right, so that's the first point that we raised earlier. The second is
that the selectors inside the parentheses are relative to the element
bearing the `:has()`. That means, for example, that the following
selector is never going to match anything:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div:has(html body h1)
```

That's because while an `<h1>` can certainly be a descendant of a
`<div>`, the `<html>` and `<body>` elements cannot. What that selector
means, translated into English, is "select any `<div>` that has a
descendant `<html>` which itself has a descendant `<body>` which has a
descendant `<h1>`." The `<html>` element will never be a descendant of
`<div>`, so this selector can't match.

To pick something a little more realistic, here's a bit of markup
showing lists nested inside one another, which has the document
structure shown in
[Figure 3-27](#ch03.xhtml_a_fragment_of_a_doc){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ol>
<li>List item</li>
<li>List item
	<ul>
	<li>List item</li>
	<li>List item</li>

		<li>List item</li>
		<li>List item</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>List item</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
```

<figure>
<div id="ch03.xhtml_a_fragment_of_a_doc" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0327.png" width="600" height="481"

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_176"><span class="label">Figure 3-27.
</span>A fragment of a document’s structure</h6>
</div>
</figure>

To that structure, we'll apply the following rules. Spoiler alert: one
of them will match an element, and the other will not:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul:has(li ol) {border: 1px solid red;}
ul:has(ol ul ol) {font-style: italic;}
```

The first causes the browser to look at all the `<ul>` elements. For any
`<ul>` it finds, it looks at the structure of the elements that descend
from that `<ul>`. If it finds an `li ol` relationship in the elements
that descend from the `<ul>`, then the `<ul>` is matched, and in this
case will be given a red border.

If we study the markup structure, either in the code or in
[Figure 3-27](#ch03.xhtml_a_fragment_of_a_doc){data-type="xref"}, we can
see two `<ul>` elements. The first has `<li>` descendants but not any
`<ol>` descendants, so it won't be matched. The second `<ul>` also has
`<li>` descendants, and one of them has an `<ol>` descendant. It's a
match! The `<ul>` will be given a red border.

The second rule also causes the browser to look at all the `<ul>`
elements. In this case, for any `<ul>` it finds, the browser looks for
an `ol ul ol` relationship within the descendants of the `<ul>`.
Elements outside the `<ul>` don't count: only those within it are
considered. Of the two `<ul>` elements in the document, neither has an
`<ol>` inside a `<ul>` that's inside another `<ol>` that is itself
descended from the `<ul>` being considered. There's no match, so neither
of the `<ul>` elements will be italicized.

Even more powerfully, you're free to mix `:has()` with other
pseudo-classes. You might, for example, want to select any heading level
if it has an image inside. You can do this in two ways: the long, clumsy
way or the compact way. Both are shown here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1:has(img), h2:has(img), h3:has(img), h4:has(img), h5:has(img), h6:has(img)

:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6):has(img)
```

The two selectors have the same outcome: if an element *is* one of the
listed heading elements, and that element *has* among its descendant
elements an `<img>` element, then the heading will be selected.

For that matter, you could select any headings that *don't* have images
inside:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6):not(:has(img))
```

Here, if an element *is* one of the listed heading levels, but an
`<img>` element is *not* one of the descendants it has, then the heading
will be selected. If we bring them together and apply them to numerous
headings, we get the results shown in
[Figure 3-28](#ch03.xhtml_to_has_and_has_not){data-type="xref"}.

</div>
</figure>

As you can already see, this selector has a lot of power. Dangers also
exist: it is entirely possible to write selectors that cause major
performance hits to the browser, especially in settings where scripting
may be used to modify the document structure. Consider the
[following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div:has(*.popup) {…}
```

This is saying, "Apply these styles to any `<div>` that has an element
with a class of `popup` as a descendant." When the page is loaded into
the browser, it has to check all the `<div>` elements to see if they
match this selector. That could mean a few trips up and down the
document's structural tree, but ideally it would resolve in a few
milliseconds, and the page can then be displayed.

But suppose we have a script that can add `.popup` to an element, or
even several elements, on the page. As soon as the class values change,
the browser has to check not only whether any styles apply to `.popup`
elements and their descendants, but also whether any ancestor or sibling
elements are affected by this change. Instead of looking only down the
document tree, the browser now has to look up as well. And any change
triggered by this could mean changes all throughout the page's layout,
both when an element is marked as `.popup` and whenever a `.popup`
element loses that class value, potentially affecting elements in
entirely different parts of the document.

This sort of performance hit is why there hasn't been a "parent
selector" or anything like it before. Computers are getting fast enough,
and browser engines smart enough, that this is much less of a worry than
it was in the past---but it's still something to keep in mind and test
out thoroughly.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104200736 primary=""

## Styling the First Letter {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_181}

The `::first-letter` []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104136048
primary="::first-letter pseudo-element"
primary-sortas="first-letter pseudo-element"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797104134960
primary="pseudo-element selectors" secondary="::first-letter"
secondary-sortas="first letter" data-type="indexterm"}pseudo-element
styles the first letter, or a leading punctuation character and the
first letter (if the text starts with punctuation), of any non-inline
element. This rule causes the first letter of every paragraph to be
colored red:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p::first-letter {color: red;}
```

The `::first-letter` pseudo-element is most commonly used to create an
initial-cap or drop-cap typographic effect. You could make the first
letter of each `<p>` twice as big as the rest of the heading, though you
may want to apply this styling to only the first letter of the first
paragraph:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p:first-of-type::first-letter {font-size: 200%;}
```

[Figure 3-29](#ch03.xhtml_the_colon_colon_first-letter_pseudo-elem){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the result of this rule.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch03.xhtml_the_colon_colon_first-letter_pseudo-elem"

</span>The <code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-element in action</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This rule effectively causes the user agent to style a fictional, or
faux, element that encloses the first letter of each `<p>`. It would
look something like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p><p-first-letter>T</p-first-letter>his is a p element, with a styled first
    letter</h2>
```

The `::first-letter` styles are applied only to the contents of the
fictional element shown in the example. This `<p-first-letter>` element
does *not* appear in the document source, nor even in the DOM tree.
Instead, its existence is constructed on the fly by the user agent and
is used to apply the `::first-letter` style(s) to the appropriate bit of
text. In other words, `<p-first-letter>` is a pseudo-element. Remember,
you don't have to add any new tags. The user agent styles the first
letter for you as if you had encased it in a [styled
element.]{.keep-together}

The first letter is defined as the first typographic letter unit of the
originating element, if it is not preceded by other content, like an
image. The specifications use the term letter unit because some
languages have letters made up of more than one character, like *œ* in
Old West Norse. Punctuation that precedes or follows the first letter
unit, even if there are several such symbols, should be included in the
`::first-letter` pseudo-element. The browser does this for you.

::: {#ch03.xhtml_styling_the_first_line .sect2}
## Styling the First Line {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_183}

Similarly, `::first-line` []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_pseudo_elem_first_line
primary="pseudo-element selectors" secondary="::first-line"
secondary-sortas="first line"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_ix_first_line_pseudo
primary="::first-line pseudo-element"
primary-sortas="first-line pseudo-element" data-type="indexterm"}can be
used to affect the first line of text in an element. For example, you
could make the first line of each paragraph in a document large and
purple:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p::first-line {
  font-size: 150%;
  color: purple;
}
```

In
[Figure 3-30](#ch03.xhtml_the_colon_colon_first-line_pseudo-elemen){data-type="xref"},
the style is applied to the first displayed line of text in each
paragraph. This is true no matter how wide or narrow the display region
is. If the first line contains only the first five words of the
paragraph, only those five words will be big and purple. If the first
line contains the first 30 words of the element, all 30 will be big and
purple.

<figure>

</span>The <code>::first-line</code> pseudo-element in action</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Because the text from "This" to "only" should be big and purple, the
user agent employs a fictional markup that looks something like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>
<p-first-line>This is a paragraph of text that has only</p-first-line>
one stylesheet applied to it. That style causes the first line to
be big and purple. No other line will have those styles applied.
</p>
```

If the first line of text were edited to include only the first seven
words of the paragraph, the fictional `</p-first-line>` would move back
and occur just after the word "that." If the user were to increase or
decrease the font-size rendering, or expand or contract the browser
window causing the width of the text to change, thereby causing the
number of words on the first line to increase or decrease, the browser
automatically sets only the words in the currently displayed first line
to be both big and purple.

The length of the first line depends on multiple factors, including the
font size, letter spacing, and width of the parent container. Depending
on the markup and the length of that first line, the end of the first
line could come in the middle of a nested element. If the `::first-line`
breaks up a nested element, such as an `em` or a hyperlink, the
properties attached to the `::first-line` will apply to only the portion
of that nested element that is displayed on the first line.

data-type="indexterm"}restrictions on what styles can be applied via
`::first-line` are exactly the same as the restrictions on styles
applied via `::placeholder`. This pseudo-element matches any placeholder
text placed into text inputs and textareas. You could, for example,
italicize text input placeholder text and turn textarea placeholder text
a dusky blue like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input::placeholder {font-style: italic;}
textarea::placeholder {color: cornflowerblue;}
```

For both `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements, this text is defined by
the `placeholder` attribute in HTML. The markup will look something very
much like this:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<input type="text" placeholder="(XXX) XXX-XXXX" id="phoneno">
<textarea placeholder="Tell us what you think!"></textarea>
```

If text is prefilled using the `value` attribute on `<input>` elements,
or by placing content inside the `<textarea>` element, that will
override the value of any `placeholder` attribute, and the resulting
text won't be selected with the `::placeholder`
pseudo-element.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103789472 primary=""

elements, it's also possible to directly select the file-selector
button---and *only* the file-selector button---in an `<input>` element
that has a `type` of `file`. This gives you a way to call attention to
the button a user needs to click to open the file-selection dialog, even
if no other part of the input can be directly styled.

If you've never seen a file-selection input, it usually looks like this:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<label for="uploadField">Select file from computer</label>
<input id="uploadField" type="file">
```

That second line gets replaced with a control whose appearance is
dependent on the combination of operating system and browser, so it
tends to look at least a little different (sometimes a lot different)
from one user to the next.

square brackets as a typographical effect:

CSS lets you []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103694528
primary="::after pseudo-element" primary-sortas="after pseudo-element"
data-type="indexterm"}insert *generated content*, and then style it
directly using the pseudo-elements `::before` and `::after`.
[Figure 3-32](#ch03.xhtml_inserting_content_before_an_element){data-type="xref"}
illustrates an example.

<figure class="coderesult">

</div>

The pseudo-element is used to insert the generated content and to style
it. To place content at the end of an element, right before the closing
tag, use the pseudo-element `::after`. You could end your documents with
an appropriate finish:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body::after {content: "The End.";}
```

Conversely, if you want to insert some content at the beginning of an
element, right after the opening tag, use `::before`. Just remember that
in either case, you have to use the [`content`]{.keep-together} property
in order to insert something to style.

Generated content is its own subject, and the entire topic (including
more detail on `::before`, `::after`, and `content`) is covered more
thoroughly in

  : [Table 3-7. ]{.label}Highlight pseudo-elements
  {#highlight_pseudo-elements}

Of the four pseudo-elements in
[Table 3-7](#ch03.xhtml_highlight_pseudo-elements){data-type="xref"},
only one, `::selection`, has any appreciable support as of early 2023.
So we'll explore it and leave the others for a future edition.

When someone uses a mouse pointer to click-hold-and-drag in order to
highlight some text, that's a selection. Most browsers have default
styles set for text selection. Authors can apply a limited set of CSS
properties to such selections, overriding the browser's default styles,
by styling the `::selection` pseudo-element. Let's say you want selected
text to be white on a navy-blue background. The CSS would look like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
::selection {color: white; background-color: navy;}
```

The primary use cases for `::selection` are specifying a color scheme
for selected text that doesn't clash with the rest of the design, or
defining different selection styles for different parts of a document.
For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
::selection {color: white; background-color: navy;}
form::selection {color: silver; background-color: maroon;}
```

Be careful in styling selection highlights: users generally expect text
they select to look a certain way, usually defined by settings in their
operating system. Thus, if you get too clever with selection styling,
you could confuse users. That said, if you know that selected text can
be difficult to see because your design's colors tend to obscure it,
defining more obvious highlight styles is probably a good idea.

Note that selected text can cross element boundaries, and that multiple
selections can occur within a given document. Imagine that a user
selects text starting from the middle of one paragraph to the middle of
the next. In effect, each paragraph will get its own selection
pseudo-element nested inside, and selection styling will be handled as
appropriate for the context. Given the following CSS and HTML, you'll
get a result like that shown in
[Figure 3-33](#ch03.xhtml_selection_styling){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.p1::selection {color: silver; background-color: black;}
.p2::selection {color: black; background-color: silver;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p class="p1">This is a paragraph with some text that can be selected,
   one of two.</p>
<p class="p2">This is a paragraph with some text that can be selected,
   two of two.</p>
```

<h6 id="ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_192"><span class="label">Figure 3-33.
</span>Selection styling</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This underscores a point made earlier: *be careful* with your selection
styling. It is all too easy to make text unreadable for some users,
particularly if your selection styles interact badly with the user's
default selection styles.

Furthermore, for user []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103427168
primary="privacy issue" secondary="::selection pseudo-element and"
secondary-sortas="selection pseudo-element and"
data-type="indexterm"}privacy reasons, you can apply only a limited
number of CSS properties to selections: `color`, `background-color`,
`text-decoration` and related properties, `text-shadow`, and the
`stroke` properties (in SVG).

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_193}

As of early 2023, selections do not have their styles inherited:
selecting text containing some inline elements will apply the selection
styling to the text outside the inline elements, but not within the
inline elements. It is not clear if this behavior is intended, but it is
consistent across major browsers.
:::

Beyond `::selection`, there will likely be increasing support for
`::target-text`. []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103421360
primary="::target-text pseudo-element"
primary-sortas="target-text pseudo-element" data-type="indexterm"}As of
early 2023, this is supported in only Chromium browsers, which
introduced a feature that needs it. With this feature, text can be added
to the end of a URL as part of the fragment identifier for highlighting,
in order to draw attention to one or more parts of the page.

For example, a URL might look something like:
`https://example.org/#:~:text=for%20use%20in%20illustrative%20examples`.
The part at the end says to the browser, "Once you've loaded the page,
highlight any examples of this text." The text is encoded for use in
URLs, which is why it's filled with `%20` strings---they represent
spaces. The result will look something like
[Figure 3-34](#ch03.xhtml_target_text_styling){data-type="xref"}.

</div>

If you wanted to suppress this content highlighting on your own pages,
you might do something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
::target-text {color: inherit; background-color: inherit;}
```

As for `::spelling-error` and `::grammar-error`, these are meant to
apply highlighting of some sort to any spelling or grammar errors within
a document. []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103365520

## The Backdrop Pseudo-Element {#ch03.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_195}

Suppose you have an []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103360464
primary="pseudo-element selectors" secondary="::backdrop"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103359488
primary="::backdrop pseudo-element"
primary-sortas="backdrop pseudo-element" data-type="indexterm"}element
that's being presented full-screen, like a video. Furthermore, suppose
that element doesn't neatly fill the screen all the way to the edges,
perhaps because the aspect ratio of the element doesn't match the aspect
ratio of the screen. What should be filled in for the parts of the
screen that the element doesn't cover? And how would you select that
non-element region with CSS?

Enter the `::backdrop` pseudo-element. This represents a box that's the
exact size of the full-screen viewport, and it is always drawn beneath a
full-screen element. So you might put a dark-gray backdrop behind any
full-screen video like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
video::backdrop {background: #111;}
```

CSS doesn't restrict which styles can be applied to backdrops, but since
they're essentially empty boxes placed behind a full-screen element,
most of the time you'll probably be setting background colors or images.

An important thing to remember is that backdrops do *not* participate in
inheritance. They can't inherit styles from ancestor elements, nor do
they pass any of their styles on to any children. Whatever styles you
apply to the backdrop will exist in their own little [pocket
universe.]{.keep-together}

primary-sortas="video-cue pseudo-element"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_ix_cue_pseudo
primary="::cue pseudo-element" primary-sortas="cue pseudo-element"
data-type="indexterm"}videos, videos often have Web Video Text Tracks
(WebVTT) data containing the text captions enabling accessibility. These
captions are known as *cues* and can be styled with the `::cue`
pseudo-element.

Let's say you have a video that's mostly dark, with a few light
segments. You might style the cues to be a lightish-gray text on a
translucent dark background, as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
::cue {
  color: silver;
  background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
}
```

This will always apply to the currently visible cue.

You can also select parts of individual cues by using a selector pattern
inside parentheses. This can be used to style specific elements defined
in the WebVTT data, drawn from a small list allowed by the WebVTT
specification. For example, any italicized cue text could be selected as
follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
::cue(i) {…}
```

You could use structural pseudo-classes like `:nth-child`, but these
will apply only within a given cue, not across cues. You can't select
every other cue for styling, but you can select every other element
within a given cue. Assume the following WebVTT data:

``` {code-language="text" data-type="programlisting"}
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.999
<v Hildy>Tell me, is the lord of the universe in?</v>

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.299
- Yes, he's in.
- In a bad humor.
```

The second cue includes two lines of text. These are treated as separate
elements, in effect, even though no elements are specified. Thus, we
could make the line Hildy says (indicated with `<v Hildy>`, which is the
WebVTT equivalent of `<v voice="Hildy">`) boldface, and give alternate
colors to the two lines of dialog in the second cue, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
::cue(v[voice="Hildy"]) {font-weight: bold;}
::cue(:nth-child(odd)) {color: yellow;}
::cue(:nth-child(even)) {color: white;}
```

As of early 2023, a limited range of properties can be applied to cues:

-   `color`

-   `background` and its associated longhand properties (e.g.,
    `background-color`)

-   `text-decoration` and its associated longhand properties (e.g.,
    `text-decoration-thickness`)

-   `text-shadow`

-   `text-combine-upright`

-   `font` and its associated longhand properties (e.g., `font-weight`)

-   `ruby-position`

-   `opacity`

-   `visibility`

-   `white-space`

-   `outline` and its associated longhand properties (e.g.,
    `outline-width`)[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103172368 primary=""

Another recent []{#ch03.xhtml_ix_doc_obj_shadow_dom
primary="Document Object Model (DOM)" secondary="shadow DOM"
data-type="indexterm"}innovation in HTML has been the introduction of
the shadow DOM, which is a deep and complex subject we don't have the
space to explore here. At a basic level, the *shadow DOM* allows
developers to create encapsulated markup, style, and scripting within
the regular (or *light*) DOM. This keeps the styles and scripts of one
shadow DOM from affecting any other part of the document, whether those
parts are in the light or shadow DOM.

We're bringing this up here because CSS does provide ways to hook into
shadow DOMs, as well as to reach up from within a shadow DOM to select
the piece of the light DOM that hosts the shadow. (This all sounds very
panel-van artistic, doesn't it?)

To []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103161360 primary="pseudo-class selectors"
secondary="shadow pseudo-classes"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103123568
primary="shadow pseudo-classes" data-type="indexterm"}see what this
means, let's bring back the combobox example from earlier in the
chapter. It looks like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<mylib-combobox>options go here</mylib-combobox>
```

All the CSS (and JS) within this custom element apply *only* to the
`<mylib-combobox>` element. Even if the CSS within the custom element
says something like `li {color: red;}`, that will apply to only `<li>`
elements constructed within the `<mylib-combobox>`. It can't leak out to
turn list items elsewhere on the page red.

That's all good, but what if you want to style the host element in a
certain way from within the custom element? The host element, more
generally called the *shadow host*, is in this case `<mylib-combobox>`.
From within the shadow host, CSS can select the host by using the
`:host` pseudo-class. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:host {border: 2px solid red;}
```

That will reach up, so to speak, "pierce through the shadow boundary"
(to use an evocative phrase from the specification), and select the
`<mylib-combobox>` element, or whatever the name of the custom element
containing the shadow DOM CSS is.

Now, suppose there can be different kinds of comboboxes, each with its
own class. Something like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<mylib-combobox class="countries">options go here</mylib-combobox>
<mylib-combobox class="regions">options go here</mylib-combobox>
<mylib-combobox class="cities">options go here</mylib-combobox>
```

You []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797103034832 primary=":host() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="host() pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}might want to
style each class of combobox differently. For that, the `:host()`
pseudo-class exists:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:host(.countries) {border: 2px solid red;}
:host(.regions) {border: 1px solid silver;}
:host(.cities) {border: none; background: gray;}
```

These rules could then be included in the styles that are loaded by all
comboboxes, using the presence of classes on the shadow hosts to style
as appropriate.

if, instead of latching on to classes, we want to style our shadow hosts
based on where they appear in the light DOM? In that case,
`:host-context()` has you covered. Thus, we can style our comboxes one
way if they're part of a form, and a different way if they're part of a
header navigation element:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:host-context(form) {border: 2px solid red;}
:host-context(header nav) {border: 1px solid silver;}
```

The first of these means "if the shadow host is the descendant of a
`<form>` element, apply these styles." The second means "if the shadow
host is the descendant of a `<nav>` element that is itself descended
from a `<header>` element, apply these styles." To be clear, `form` and
`<nav>` are *not* the shadow hosts in these situations! The selector in
`:host-context()` is describing only the context in which the host needs
to be placed in order to be selected.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797102878528
primary="shadow DOM pseudo-elements" data-type="indexterm"}addition to
having hosts, shadow DOMs can also define *slots*. These are elements
that are meant to have other things slotted into them, much as you would
place an expansion card into an expansion slot. Let's expand the markup
of the combobox a little bit:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<mylib-combobox>
     <span slot="label">Country</span>
     ["shadow-tree"]
          <slot name="label"></slot>
     [/"shadow tree"]
</mylib-combobox>
```

Now, to be clear, the `shadow tree` isn't actual markup. It's just there
to represent the shadow DOM that gets constructed by whatever script
builds it. So please don't go writing square-bracketed quoted element
names into your documents; they will fail.

That said, []{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797102853728
primary="::slotted() pseudo-element"
primary-sortas="slotted() pseudo-element" data-type="indexterm"}given a
setup like the preceding one, `<span>` would be slotted into the `slot`
element, because the names match. You could try applying styles to the
slot, but what if you'd rather style the thing that got plugged into the
slot? That's represented by the `::slotted()` pseudo-element, which
accepts a selector as needed.

Thus, if you want to style all slotted elements one way and then add
some extra style if the slotted element is a `<span>`, you would write
something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
::slotted(*) {outline: 2px solid red;}
::slotted(span) {font-style-italic;}
```

More practically, you could style all slots red, and then remove that
red from any slot that's been slotted with content, thus making the
slots that failed to get any content stand out. Something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
slot {color: red;}
::slotted(*) {color: black;}
```

The shadow DOM and its use is a complex topic, and one that we have not
even begun to scratch the surface of in this section. Our only goal is
to introduce the pseudo-classes and -elements that pertain to the shadow
DOM, not explain the shadow DOM or illustrate best
practices.[]{#ch03.xhtml_idm45797102792256 primary=""

As you saw in this chapter, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements bring a
whole lot of power and flexibility to the table. Whether selecting
hyperlinks based on their visited state, matching elements based on
their placement in the document structure, or styling pieces of the
shadow DOM, there's a pseudo selector for nearly every taste.

In this chapter and the preceding one, we've mentioned the concepts of
specificity and the cascade a few times and promised to talk about them
soon. Well, soon is now. That's exactly what we'll do in the next
chapter.

Chapters [2](../Text/ch02.xhtml#selectors){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"} and
[3](../Text/ch03.xhtml#pseudo_classes_and_elements){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"} showed how document structure and CSS
selectors allow you to apply a wide variety of styles to elements.
Knowing that every valid document generates a structural tree, you can
create selectors that target elements based on their ancestors,
attributes, sibling elements, and more. The structural tree is what
allows selectors to function and is also central to a similarly crucial
aspect of CSS: inheritance.

*Inheritance* is the []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797102737120

data-type="indexterm"}mechanism by which some property values are passed
on from an element to a descendant element. When determining which
values should apply to an element, a user agent must consider not only
inheritance but also the *specificity* of the declarations, as well as
the origin of the declarations themselves. This process of consideration
is what's known as the *cascade*.

We will explore the interrelation between these three
mechanisms---specificity, inheritance, and the cascade---in this
chapter. For now, the difference between the latter two can be summed up
this way: when we write `h1 {color: red; color: blue;}`, the `<h1>`
becomes blue because of the cascade, and any `<span>` inside the `<h1>`
also becomes blue because of inheritance.

Above all, regardless of how abstract things may seem, keep going! Your
perseverance will be rewarded.

xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"} and
[3](../Text/ch03.xhtml#pseudo_classes_and_elements){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"} that you can select elements by using a
wide variety of means. In fact, the same element can often be selected
by two or more rules, each with its own selector. Let's consider the
following three pairs of rules. Assume that each pair will match the
same element:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: red;}
body h1 {color: green;}

h2.grape {color: purple;}
h2 {color: silver;}

html > body table tr[id="totals"] td ul > li {color: maroon;}
li#answer {color: navy;}
```

Only one of the two rules in each pair can be applied, or "win," since
the matched elements can be only one color at a time. How do we know
which one will win?

The answer is found in the *specificity* of each selector. For every
rule, the user agent (i.e., a web browser) evaluates the specificity of
the selector and attaches the specificity to each declaration in the
rule within the cascade layer that has precedence. When an element has
two or more conflicting property declarations, the one with the highest
specificity will win out.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_204}

This isn't the whole story in terms of conflict resolution, which is a
bit more complicated than a single paragraph can cover. For now, just
keep in mind that selector specificity is compared only to other
selectors that share the same origin and cascade layer. We'll cover
those terms, and more in ["The
Cascade"](#ch04.xhtml_the_cascade){data-type="xref"}.
:::

A selector's specificity is determined by the components of the selector
itself. A specificity value can be expressed in three parts, like this:
`0,0,0`. The actual specificity of a selector is determined as follows:

-   For every ID attribute value given in the selector, add `1,0,0`.

-   For every class attribute value, attribute selection, or
    pseudo-class given in the selector, add `0,1,0`.

-   For every element and pseudo-element given in the selector, add
    `0,0,1`.

-   Combinators do not contribute anything to the specificity.

-   Anything listed inside a `:where()` pseudo-class, and the universal
    selector, adds `0,0,0`. (While they do not contribute anything to
    the specificity weight, they do match elements, unlike combinators.)

-   The []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797102618880 primary=":not() pseudo-class"
    primary-sortas="not() pseudo-class"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797102617872
    primary=":has() pseudo-class" primary-sortas="has() pseudo-class"
    data-type="indexterm"}specificity of an `:is()`, `:not()`, or
    `:has()` pseudo-class is equal to the specificity of the most
    specific selector in its selector list argument.

For example, the following rules' selectors result in the indicated
specificities:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: red;}                     /* specificity = 0,0,1 */
p em {color: purple;}                /* specificity = 0,0,2 */
.grape {color: purple;}              /* specificity = 0,1,0 */
*.bright {color: yellow;}            /* specificity = 0,1,0 */
p.bright em.dark {color: maroon;}    /* specificity = 0,2,2 */
#id216 {color: blue;}                /* specificity = 1,0,0 */
*:is(aside#warn, code) {color: red;} /* specificity = 1,0,1 */
div#sidebar *[href] {color: silver;} /* specificity = 1,1,1 */
```

If an `<em>` element is matched by both the second and fifth rules in
this example, that element will be maroon because the sixth rule's
specificity outweighs the second's.

Take []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797102592512 primary=":is() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="is() pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}special note of
the next-to-last selector, `*:is(aside#warn, code)`. The `:is()`
pseudo-class is one of a small group of pseudo-classes for which the
specificity is equal to the most specific selector in the selector list.
Here, the selector list is `aside#warn, code`. The `aside#warn` compound
selector has a specificity of `1,0,1`, and the `code` selector has a
specificity of `0,0,1`. Thus, the whole `:is()` portion of the selector
is set to the specificity of the `aside#warn` selector.

Now, let's return to the pairs of rules from earlier in the section and
fill in the specificities:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: red;}         /* 0,0,1 */
body h1 {color: green;}  /* 0,0,2 (winner)*/

h2.grape {color: purple;}  /* 0,1,1 (winner) */
h2 {color: silver;}        /* 0,0,1 */

html > body table tr[id="totals"] td ul > li {color: maroon;}  /* 0,1,7 */
li#answer {color: navy;}                                       /* 1,0,1
   (winner) */
```

We've indicated the winning rule in each pair; in each case, it's
because the specificity is higher. Notice how they're listed and that
the order of the rules doesn't matter here.

In the second pair, the selector `h2.grape` wins because it has an extra
class: `0,1,1` beats out `0,0,1`. In the third pair, the second rule
wins because `1,0,1` wins out over `0,1,7`. In fact, the specificity
value `0,1,0` would win out over the value `0,0,13`.

This happens because the values are compared from left to right. A
specificity of `1,0,0` will win out over any specificity that begins
with a `0`, no matter what the rest of the numbers might be. So `1,0,1`
wins over `0,1,7` because the `1` in the first value's first position
beats the `0` in the second value's first position.

## Declarations and Specificity {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_205}

Once the []{#ch04.xhtml_ix_specificity_declar primary="specificity"
secondary="declarations"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_declar_specific
primary="declarations" secondary="specificity"
data-type="indexterm"}specificity of a selector has been determined, the
specificity value will be conferred on all of its associated
declarations. Consider this rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: silver; background: black;}
```

For specificity purposes, the user agent must treat the rule as if it
were "ungrouped" into separate rules. Thus, the previous example would
become the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: silver;}
h1 {background: black;}
```

Both have a specificity of `0,0,1`, and that's the value conferred on
each declaration. The same splitting-up process happens with a grouped
selector as well. Given the rule,

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, h2.section {color: silver; background: black;}
```

the user agent treats it as if it were the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: silver;}             /* 0,0,1 */
h1 {background: black;}         /* 0,0,1 */
h2.section {color: silver;}     /* 0,1,1 */
h2.section {background: black;} /* 0,1,1 */
```

This becomes important when multiple rules match the same element and
some of the declarations clash. For example, consider these rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 + p {color: black; font-style: italic;}              /* 0,0,2 */
p {color: gray; background: white; font-style: normal;} /* 0,0,1 */
*.callout {color: black; background: silver;}           /* 0,1,0 */
```

In every []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098707504 primary="rules"
secondary="cascade" data-type="indexterm"}case, the user agent
determines which rules match a given element, calculates all of the
associated declarations and their specificities, determines which rules
win out, and then applies the winners to the element to get the styled
result. These machinations must be performed on every element, selector,
and declaration. Fortunately, the user agent does it all automatically
and nearly instantly. This behavior is an important component of the
cascade, which we'll discuss later in this
chapter.[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098706368 primary=""

## Resolving Multiple Matches {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_207}

When an []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098702704 primary="specificity"
secondary="multiple match resolution" data-type="indexterm"}element is
matched by more than one selector in a grouped selector, the most
specific selector is used. Consider the following CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li,            /* 0,0,1 */
.quirky,       /* 0,1,0 */
#friendly,     /* 1,0,0 */
li.happy.happy.happy#friendly { /* 1,3,1 */
   color: blue;
}
```

Here we have one rule with a grouped selector, and each of the
individual selectors has a very different specificity. Now suppose we
find this in our HTML:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<li class="happy quirky" id="friendly">This will be blue.</li>
```

Every one of the selectors in the grouped selector applies to the list
item! Which one is used for specificity purposes? The most specific.
Thus, in this example, the blue is applied with a specificity of
`1,3,1`.

You might have noticed that we repeated the `happy` class name three
times in one of the selectors. This is a bit of hack that can be used
with classes, attributes, pseudo-classes, and even ID selectors to
increase specificity. Do be careful with it, since artificially
inflating specificity can create problems in the future: you might want
to override that rule with another, and that rule will need even more
classes chained together.

primary="universal selector (*)"

selector does not contribute to specificity. It has a specificity of
`0,0,0`, which is different from having no specificity (as we'll discuss
in ["Inheritance"](#ch04.xhtml_inheritance){data-type="xref"}).
Therefore, given the following two rules, a paragraph descended from a
`<div>` will be black, but all other elements will be gray:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div p {color: black;} /* 0,0,2 */
* {color: gray;}      /* 0,0,0 */
```

This means the specificity of a selector that contains a universal
selector along with other selectors is not changed by the presence of
the universal selector. The following two selectors have exactly the
same specificity:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div p         /* 0,0,2 */
body * strong /* 0,0,2 */
```

The []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098566272 primary=":where() pseudo-class"
primary-sortas="where() pseudo-class" data-type="indexterm"}same is true
for the `:where()` pseudo-class, regardless of whatever selectors might
be in its selector list. Thus, `:where(aside#warn, code)` has a
specificity of `0,0,0`.

Combinators, []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098563600 primary="combinators"

specificity. Thus, they have no impact on a selector's overall
specificity.

primary="attribute selectors" secondary="specificity"
data-type="indexterm"}important to note the difference in specificity
between an ID selector and an attribute selector that targets an `id`
attribute. Returning to the third pair of rules in the example code, we
find the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html > body table tr[id="totals"] td ul > li {color: maroon;} /* 0,1,7 */
li#answer {color: navy;}                                      /* 1,0,1 (wins) */
```

The ID selector (`#answer`) in the second rule contributes `1,0,0` to
the overall specificity of the selector. In the first rule, however, the
attribute selector (`[id="totals"]`) contributes `0,1,0` to the overall
specificity. Thus, given the following rules, the element with an `id`
of `meadow` will be green:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

data-type="indexterm"}declaration is so important that it outweighs all
other considerations. CSS calls these *important declarations* (for
hopefully obvious reasons) and lets you mark them by inserting the flag
`!important` just before the terminating semicolon in a declaration:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.dark {color: #333 !important; background: white;}
```

Here, the color value of `#333` is marked with the `!important` flag,
whereas the background value of `white` is not. If you wish to mark both
declarations as important, each declaration needs its own `!important`
flag:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.dark {color: #333 !important; background: white !important;}
```

You must place the `!important` flag correctly, or the declaration may
be invalidated: [`!important`]{.keep-together} *always* goes at the end
of a declaration, just before the semicolon. This placement is
especially critical when it comes to properties that allow values
containing multiple keywords, such as `font`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.light {color: yellow; font: smaller Times, serif !important;}
```

If `!important` were placed anywhere else in the `font` declaration, the
entire declaration would likely be invalidated and none of its styles
applied.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_211}

We realize that to those of you who come from a programming background,
the syntax of this token instinctively translates to "not important."
For whatever reason, the bang (`!`) was chosen as the delimiter for
important flags, and it does *not* mean "not" in CSS, no matter how many
other languages give it that very meaning. This association is
unfortunate, but we're stuck with it.
:::

Declarations that are marked `!important` do not have a special
specificity value, but are instead considered separately from
unimportant declarations. In effect, all `!important`
[declarations]{.keep-together} are grouped together, and specificity
conflicts are resolved within that group. Similarly, all unimportant
declarations are considered as a group, with any conflicts within the
unimportant group as described previously. Thus, in any case where an
important and an unimportant declaration conflict, an important
declaration will always win (unless the user agent or user have declared
the same property as important, which you'll see later in the chapter).

It's generally bad practice to use `!important` in your CSS, and it is
rarely needed. If you find yourself reaching for `!important`, stop and
look for other ways to get the same result without using
[`!important`.]{.keep-together} Cascade layers are one such possibility;

primary="inheritance"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_css_inherit
primary="CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)" secondary="inheritance"
data-type="indexterm"}key concept in understanding how styles are
applied to elements is *inheritance*. Inheritance is the mechanism by
which some styles are applied not only to a specified element, but also
to its descendants. If a color is applied to an `<h1>` element, for
example, that color is applied to all text inside the `<h1>`, even the
text enclosed within child elements of that `<h1>`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: gray;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>Meerkat <em>Central</em></h1>
```

Both the ordinary `<h1>` text and the `<em>` text are colored gray
because the `<em>` element inherits the value of `color` from the
`<h1>`. If property values could not be inherited by descendant
elements, the `<em>` text would be black, not gray, and we'd have to
color the elements separately.

Consider an unordered list. Let's say we apply a style of `color: gray;`
for `<ul>` elements:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {color: gray;}
```

We expect that style applied to a `<ul>` will also be applied to its
list items, as well as to any content of those list items, including the
marker (i.e., the bullet next to each list item). Thanks to inheritance,
that's exactly what happens, as
[Figure 4-3](#ch04.xhtml_inheritance_of_styles){data-type="xref"}
demonstrates.

<figure class="coderesult">

It's easier to see how inheritance works by turning to a tree diagram of
a document.
[Figure 4-4](#ch04.xhtml_a_simple_tree_diagram){data-type="xref"} shows
the tree diagram for a document much like the very simple document shown
in [Figure 4-3](#ch04.xhtml_inheritance_of_styles){data-type="xref"}.

When the declaration `color: gray;` is applied to the `<ul>` element,
that element takes on that declaration. The value is then propagated
down the tree to the descendant elements and continues on until no more
descendants remain to inherit the value. Values are *never* propagated
upward; an element never passes values up to its ancestors.

exception: background styles applied to the `<body>` element can be
passed to the `<html>` element, which is the document's root element and
therefore defines its canvas. This happens only if the `<body>` element
has a defined background and the `<html>` element does not. A few other
properties share this body-to-root behavior, such as `overflow`, but it
happens only with the `<body>` element. No other elements risk
inheriting properties from a descendant.
:::

Inheritance is one of those things about CSS that is so basic that you
almost never think about it unless you have to. However, you should
still keep a couple of things in mind.

First, note that many []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098085024 primary="borders"
secondary="inheritance risks with" data-type="indexterm"}properties are
not inherited---generally in order to avoid undesirable outcomes. For
example, the property `border` (which is used to set borders on
elements) does not inherit. A quick glance at
[Figure 4-5](#ch04.xhtml_why_borders_arenat_inherited){data-type="xref"}
reveals why this is the case. If borders were inherited, documents would
become much more cluttered---unless the author took the extra effort to
turn off the inherited borders.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch04.xhtml_why_borders_arenat_inherited" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_218"><span class="label">Figure 4-5.
</span>Why borders aren’t inherited</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As it happens, most of the []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098079936
primary="box-model properties" data-type="indexterm"}box-model
properties---including margins, padding, backgrounds, and borders---are
not inherited for the same reason. After all, you likely wouldn't want
all of the links in a paragraph to inherit a 30-pixel left margin from
their parent element!

Second, inherited values have no specificity at all, not even zero
specificity. This seems like an academic distinction until you work
through the consequences of the lack of inherited specificity. Consider
the following rules and markup fragment and compare them to the result
shown in
[Figure 4-6](#ch04.xhtml_zero_specificity_defeats_no_specificity){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
* {color: gray;}

Since the []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098004768 primary="specificity"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797098000960
primary="universal selector (*)" secondary="inheritance and)"
data-type="indexterm"}universal selector applies to all elements and has
zero specificity, its color declaration's value of `gray` wins out over
the inherited value of `black`, which has no specificity at all. (And
now you may understand why we listed `:where()` and the universal
selector as having `0,0,0` specificity: they add no weight, but do match
elements.) Therefore, the `<em>` element is rendered gray instead of
black.

This example vividly illustrates one of the potential problems of using
the universal selector indiscriminately. Because it can match *any*
element or pseudo-element, the universal selector often has the effect
of short-circuiting inheritance. This can be worked around, but it's
usually more sensible to avoid the problem in the first place by not
using the universal selector by itself indiscriminately.

The complete lack of specificity for inherited values is not a trivial
point. For example, assume that a stylesheet has been written such that
all text in a toolbar is to be white on black:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#toolbar {color: white; background: black;}
```

This will work so long as the element with an `id` of `toolbar` contains
nothing but plain text. If, however, the text within this element is all
hyperlinks (`a` elements), then the user agent's styles for hyperlinks
will take over. In a web browser, this means they'll likely be colored
blue, since the browser's internal stylesheet probably contains an entry
like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link {color: blue;}
```

To overcome this problem, you must declare something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#toolbar {color: white; background: black;}
#toolbar a:any-link {color: white;}
```

By targeting a rule directly at the `a` elements within the toolbar,
you'll get the result shown in
[Figure 4-7](#ch04.xhtml_directly_assigning_styles_to_the_relevan){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch04.xhtml_directly_assigning_styles_to_the_relevan"

</span>Directly assigning styles to the relevant elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Another way to get the same result is to use the value `inherit`,
covered in the next chapter. We can alter the previous example like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#toolbar {color: white; background: black;}
#toolbar a:link {color: inherit;}
```

This also leads to the result shown in
[Figure 4-7](#ch04.xhtml_directly_assigning_styles_to_the_relevan){data-type="xref"},
because the value of `color` is explicitly inherited thanks to an
assigned rule whose selector has
specificity.[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097849728 primary=""

primary="elements" secondary="order in cascade"
data-type="indexterm"}chapter, we've skirted one rather important issue:
what happens when two rules of equal specificity apply to the same
element? How does the browser resolve the conflict? For example,
consider the following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: red;}
h1 {color: blue;}
```

Which one wins? Both have a specificity of `0,0,1`, so they have equal
weight and should both apply. That can't be the case because the element
can't be both red and blue. So which will it be?

At last, the name *Cascading Style Sheets* comes into focus: CSS is
based on a method of causing styles to *cascade* together, which is made
possible by combining inheritance and specificity with a few rules. The
cascade rules for CSS are as follows:

1.  Find all rules containing a selector that matches a given element.

2.  Sort all []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097804528
    primary="explicit weight, cascade order"
    data-type="indexterm"}declarations applying to the given element by
    *explicit weight*.

3.  Sort all []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097802416 primary="author origin"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097801680
    primary="user agent origin"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097801008
    primary="reader origin" data-type="indexterm"}declarations applying
    to the given element by *origin*. There are three basic origins:
    author, reader, and user agent. Under normal circumstances, the
    author's styles (that is, your styles as the author of the page) win
    out over the reader's styles, and both author and reader styles
    override the user agent's default styles. This is reversed for rules
    marked `!important`, where user agent styles override author styles,
    and both override reader styles.

4.  Sort all []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097773072
    primary="encapsulation context, cascade rules"
    data-type="indexterm"}declarations applying to the given element by
    *encapsulation context*. If a style is assigned via a shadow DOM,
    for example, it has an encapsulation context for all elements within
    that same shadow DOM and does not apply to elements outside that
    shadow DOM. This allows encapsulated styles to override styles that
    are inherited from outside the shadow DOM.

5.  Sort all []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097770992
    primary="element-attached declarations, cascade rules"
    data-type="indexterm"}declarations by whether they are *element
    attached*. Styles assigned via a `style` attribute are element
    attached. Styles assigned from a stylesheet, whether external or
    embedded, are not.

6.  Sort all []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097768240 primary="cascade layer"
    data-type="indexterm"}declarations by *cascade layer*. For
    normal-weight styles, the later a cascade layer first appears in the
    CSS, the greater the precedence. Styles without a layer are
    considered to be part of a "default" final pseudo-layer, one that
    has higher precedence than styles in explicitly created layers. For
    important-weight styles, the *earlier* a cascade layer appears in
    the CSS, the greater its precedence, and all important-weight styles
    in explicitly created layers win out over styles in the default
    layer, important or otherwise. Cascade layers can appear in any
    origin.

7.  Sort all []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097765680 primary="specificity"
    secondary="in cascade rule order"
    secondary-sortas="cascade rule order"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097764400
    primary="cascade" secondary="by specificity"
    secondary-sortas="specificity" data-type="indexterm"}declarations
    applying to the given element by *specificity*. Those elements with
    a higher specificity have more weight than those with lower
    specificity.

8.  Sort all []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097761696
    primary="appearance order, cascade rules"
    data-type="indexterm"}declarations applying to the given element by
    *order of appearance*. The later a declaration appears in the
    stylesheet or document, the more weight it is given. Declarations
    that appear in an imported stylesheet are considered to come before
    all declarations within the stylesheet that imports them.

To be clear about how this all works, let's consider examples that
illustrate some of the cascade rules.[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097759744
primary="" startref="ix_declar_casc_order"

::: {#ch04.xhtml_sorting_by_weight_and_origin .sect2}
## Sorting by Importance and Origin {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_222}

If two []{#ch04.xhtml_ix_origin_casc_rules
primary="origin, in cascade rules"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_cascade_imp_orig
primary="cascade" secondary="by importance and origin"
secondary-sortas="importance and origin" data-type="indexterm"}rules
apply to an element, and one is marked `!important`, the important rule
[wins out:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {color: gray !important;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="color: black;">Well, <em>hello</em> there!</p>
```

Even though a color is assigned in the `style` attribute of the
paragraph, the `!important` rule wins out, and the paragraph is gray.
This occurs because sorting by `!important` has higher precedence than
sorting by element-attached styles (`style=""`). The gray is inherited
by the `<em>` element as well.

Note that if `!important` is added to the inline style in this
situation, *it* will be the winner. Thus, given the following, the
paragraph (and its descendant element) will be black:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {color: gray !important;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="color: black !important;">Well, <em>hello</em> there!</p>
```

If the []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097642720 primary="reader origin"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097642112
primary="author origin" data-type="indexterm"}importance is the same,
the origin of a rule is considered. If an element is matched by normal
styles in both the author's stylesheet and the reader's stylesheet, the
author's styles are used. For example, assume that the following styles
come from the indicated origins:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p em {color: black;}    /* author's stylesheet */

p em {color: yellow;}   /* reader's stylesheet */
```

In this case, emphasized text within paragraphs is colored black, not
yellow, because the author styles win out over the reader styles.
However, if both rules are marked [`!important`]{.keep-together}, the
situation changes:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p em {color: black !important;}    /* author's stylesheet */

p em {color: yellow !important;}   /* reader's stylesheet */
```

Now the emphasized text in paragraphs will be yellow, not black.

As it happens, the []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097552112
primary="user agent origin" data-type="indexterm"}user agent's default
styles---which are often influenced by the user preferences---are
figured into this step. The default style declarations are the least
influential of all. Therefore, if an author-defined rule applies to
anchors (e.g., declaring them to be `white`), then this rule overrides
the user agent's defaults.

To sum up, CSS has eight basic levels to consider in terms of
declaration precedence. In order of most to least precedence, these are
as follows:

1.  Transition declarations (see
    [Chapter 18](../Text/ch18.xhtml#x-transitions){data-type="xref"})

2.  User agent important declarations

3.  Reader important declarations

4.  Author important declarations

5.  Animation declarations (see
    [Chapter 19](../Text/ch19.xhtml#animation){data-type="xref"})

6.  Author normal declarations

## Sorting by Element Attachment {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_223}

Styles can be []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097523968 primary="cascade"

primary="element-attached styles, cascade rules"
data-type="indexterm"}attached to an element by using a markup attribute
such as `style`. These are called *element-attached* styles, and they
are outweighed only by considerations of origin and weight.

To understand this, consider the following rule and markup fragment:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: red;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1 style="color: green;">The Meadow Party</h1>
```

Given that the rule is applied to the `<h1>` element, you would still
probably expect the text of the `<h1>` to be green. This happens because
every inline declaration is element attached, and so has a higher weight
than styles that aren't element attached, like the `color: red` rule.

This []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797097496336 primary="inline styles"
data-type="indexterm"}means that even elements with `id` attributes that
match a rule will obey the inline style declaration. Let's modify the
previous example to include an `id`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1#meadow {color: red;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1 id="meadow" style="color: green;">The Meadow Party</h1>
```

Thanks to the inline declaration's weight, the text of the `<h1>`
element will still be green.

Just remember that inline styles are generally a bad practice, so try
not to use them if at all possible.

## Sorting by Cascade Layer {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_224}

*Cascade layers* allow []{#ch04.xhtml_ix_cascade_bylayer
primary="cascade" secondary="by cascade layer"
secondary-sortas="cascade layer" data-type="indexterm"}authors to group
styles together so that they share a precedence level within the
cascade. This might sound like `!important`; in some ways they are
similar---but in others, very different. This is easier to demonstrate
than it is to describe. The ability to create cascade layers means
authors can balance various needs, such as the needs of a component
library, against the needs of a specific page or part of a web app.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_225}

Cascade layers were introduced to CSS at the end of 2021, so browser
support for them exists only in browsers released from that point
forward.
:::

If []{#ch04.xhtml_ix_at_layer_rule primary="@layer rule"
primary-sortas="layer rule"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_atrule_layer primary="at-rules"
secondary="@layer" secondary-sortas="layer"
data-type="indexterm"}conflicting declarations apply to an element and
all have the same explicit weight and origin, and none are element
attached, they are next sorted by cascade layer. The order of precedence
for layers is set by the order in which the layers are first declared or
used, with later declared layers taking precedence over earlier declared
layers for normal styles. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@layer site {
     h1 {color: red;}
}
@layer page {
     h1 {color: blue;}
}
```

These `<h1>` elements will be colored blue. This is because the `page`
layer comes later in the CSS than the `site` layer, and so has higher
precedence.

Any style not part of a named cascade layer is assigned to an implicit
"default" layer, one that has higher precedence than any named layer for
unimportant rules. Suppose we alter the previous example as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: maroon;}
@layer site {
     h1 {color: red;}
}
@layer page {
     h1 {color: blue;}
}
```

The `<h1>` elements will now be maroon, because the implicit "default"
layer to which the `h1 {color: maroon;}` belongs has higher precedence
than any named layer.

You can also define a specific precedence order for named cascade
layers. Consider the following CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@layer site, page;

@layer page {
   h1 {color: blue;}
}

@layer site {
   h1 {color: red;}
}
```

Here, the first line defines an order of precedence for the layers: the
`page` layer will be given higher precedence than the `site` layer for
normal-weight rules like those shown in the example. Thus, in this case,
`<h1>` elements will be blue, because when the layers are sorted, `page`
is given more precedence than `site`. For important-flagged rules, the
order of precedence is reversed. Thus, if both rules were marked
`!important`, the precedence would flip and `<h1>` elements would be
red.

Let's talk a little bit more about how cascade layers specifically work,
especially since they're so new to CSS. Let's say you want to define
three layers: one for the basic site styles, one for individual page
styles, and one for a component library whose styles are imported from
an external stylesheet. []{#ch04.xhtml_ix_import_rule_ch4
primary="@import rule" primary-sortas="import rule"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_atrule_import2
primary="at-rules" secondary="@import" secondary-sortas="import"
data-type="indexterm"}The CSS might look like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@layer site, page;
@import url(/assets/css/components.css) layer(components);
```

This ordering will have normal-weight `components` styles override and
`page` and `site` normal-weight styles, and normal-weight `page` styles
will override only `site` normal-weight styles. Conversely, important
`site` styles will override all `page` and `components` styles, whether
they're important or normal weight, and `page` important styles will
override all `components` styles.

Here's a small example of how layers might be managed:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@layer site, component, page;
@import url(/c/lib/core.css) layer(component);
@import url(/c/lib/widgets.css) layer(component);
@import url(/c/site.css) layer(site);

@layer page {
   h1 {color: maroon;}
   p {margin-top: 0;}
}

@layer site {
   body {font-size: 1.1rem;}
   h1 {color: orange;}
   p {margin-top: 0.5em;}
}

p {margin-top: 1em;}
```

This example has three imported stylesheets, one of which is assigned to
the `site` layer and two of which are in the `component` layer. Then
some rules are assigned to the `page` layer, and a couple of rules are
placed in the `site` layer. The rules in the `@layer site {}` block will
be combined with the rules from `/c/site.css` into a single `site`
layer.

After that, there's a rule outside the explicit cascade layers, which
means it's part of the implicit "default" layer. Rules in this default
layer will override the styles of any of the other layers. So, given the
code shown, paragraphs will have top margins of `1em`.

But before all of that, a directive sets the precedence order of the
named layers: `page` overrules `component` and `site`, and `component`
overrules `site`. Here's how those various rules are grouped as far as
the cascade is concerned, with comments to describe their placement in
the sorting:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* 'site' layer is the lowest weighted */
@import url(/c/site.css) layer(site);
@layer site {
   body {font-size: 1.1rem;}
   h1 {color: orange;}
   p {margin-top: 0.5em;}
}

/* 'component' layer is the next-lowest weighted */
@import url(/c/lib/core.css) layer(component);
@import url(/c/lib/widgets.css) layer(component);

/* 'page' layer is the next-highest weighted */
@layer page {
   h1 {color: maroon;}
   p {margin-top: 0;}
}

/* the implicit layer is the highest weighted */
p {margin-top: 1em;}
```

As you can see, the later a layer comes in the ordering of the layers,
the more weight it's given by the cascade's sorting algorithm.

To be clear, cascade layers don't have to be named. Naming just keeps
things a lot clearer in terms of setting an order for them, and it also
enables adding styles to the layer. Here are some examples of using
unnamed cascade layers:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(base.css) layer;

p {margin-top: 1em;}

@layer {
   h1 {color: maroon;}
   body p {margin-top: 0;}
}
```

In this case, the rules imported from *base.css* are assigned to an
unnamed layer. Even though this layer doesn't actually have a name,
let's think of it as CL1. Then a rule outside the layers sets paragraph
top margins to `1em`. Finally, an unnamed layer block has a couple of
rules; let's think of this layer as CL2.

So now we have rules in three layers: CL1, CL2, and the implicit layer.
And that's the order they're considered in, so in the case of any
conflicting normal rules, the rules in the implicit default layer (which
comes last in the ordering) will win over conflicting rules in the other
two layers, and rules in CL2 will win over conflicting rules in CL1.

At least, that's the case for normal-weight rules. For `!important`
rules, the order of precedence is flipped, so those in CL1 will win over
conflicting important rules in the other two layers, and important rules
in CL2 win over conflicting important rules in the implicit layer.
Strange but true!

This sorting by order will come up again in just a little bit, but first
let's bring specificity into the
cascade.[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797101278384 primary=""

If conflicting []{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797107706400 primary="cascade"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797107705120
primary="specificity" secondary="in cascade rule order"
secondary-sortas="cascade rule order" data-type="indexterm"}declarations
apply to an element and those declarations all have the same explicit
weight, origin, element attachment (or lack thereof), and cascade layer,
they are then sorted by specificity. The most specific declaration wins
out, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@layer page {
  p#bright#bright#bright {color: grey;}
}
p#bright {color: silver;}
p {color: black;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p id="bright">Well, hello there!</p>
```

Given these rules, the text of the paragraph will be silver, as
illustrated in
[Figure 4-8](#ch04.xhtml_higher_specificity_wins_out_over_lower){data-type="xref"}.
Why? Because the specificity of `p#bright` (`1,0,1`) overrides the
specificity of `p` (`0,0,1)`, even though the latter rule comes later in
the stylesheet. The styles from the `page` layer, even though they have
the strongest selector (`3,0,1`), aren't even compared. Only the
declarations from the layer with precedence are in contention.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch04.xhtml_higher_specificity_wins_out_over_lower"
class="figure">

</div>
</figure>

Remember that this rule applies only if the rules are part of the same
cascade layer. If not, specificity doesn't matter: a `0,0,1` selector in
the implicit layer will win over any unimportant rule in an explicitly
created cascade layer, no matter how high the latter's specificity gets.

## Sorting by Order {#ch04.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_228}

Finally, if []{#ch04.xhtml_ix_order_cascade_by_ch4
primary="order, cascade by"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_cascade_order_ch4
primary="cascade" secondary="by order" secondary-sortas="order"
data-type="indexterm"}two rules have exactly the same explicit weight,
origin, element attachment, cascade layer, and specificity, then the one
that appears later in the stylesheet wins out, similar to the way
cascade layers are sorted in order so that later layers win over earlier
layers.

Let's return to an earlier example, where we find the following two
rules in the document's stylesheet:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body h1 {color: red;}
html h1 {color: blue;}
```

In this case, the value of `color` for all `<h1>` elements in the
document will be `blue`, not `red`. This is because the two rules are
tied with each other in terms of explicit weight and origin, are in the
same cascade layer, and the selectors have equal specificity, so the
last one declared is the winner. It doesn't matter how close together
the elements are in the document tree; even though `<body>` and `<h1>`
are closer together than `<html>` and `<h1>`, the later one wins. The
only thing that matters (when the origin, cascade layer, layer, and
specificity are the same) is the order in which the rules appear in the
CSS.

So what happens if rules from completely separate stylesheets conflict?
For example, suppose the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(basic.css);
h1 {color: blue;}
```

What if `h1 {color: red;}` appears in *basic.css*? In this case, since
there are no cascade layers in play, the entire contents of *basic.css*
are treated as if they were pasted into the stylesheet at the point
where the `@import` occurs. Thus, any rule contained in the document's
stylesheet occurs later than those from the `@import`. If they tie in
terms of explicit weight and specificity, the document's stylesheet
contains the winner. Consider the [following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p em {color: purple;}  /* from imported stylesheet */

p em {color: gray;}    /* rule contained within the document */
```

In this case, the second rule wins out over the imported rule because it
is the last one specified, and both are in the implicit cascade layer.

Order []{#ch04.xhtml_ix_lvfha_spellout_order
primary="link-visited-focus-hover-active (LVFHA) ordering"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_lvfha_acronym_order
primary="LVFHA (link-visited-focus-hover-active) ordering"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch04.xhtml_ix_link_lvfha primary="links"
secondary="LVFHA ordering" data-type="indexterm"}sorting is the reason
behind the often-recommended ordering of link styles. The recommendation
is that you write your link styles in the order `link`, `visited`,
`focus`, `hover`, `active`, or LVFHA, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link {color: blue;}
a:visited {color: purple;}
a:focus {color: green;}
a:hover {color: red;}
a:active {color: orange;}
```

Thanks to the information in this chapter, you now know that the
specificity of all of these selectors is the same: `0,1,1`. Because they
all have the same explicit weight, origin, and specificity, the last one
that matches an element will win out. An unvisited link that is being
clicked or otherwise activated, such as via the keyboard, is matched by
four of the rules---`:link`, `:focus`, `:hover`, and `:active`---so the
last one of those four will win out. Given the LVFHA ordering, `:active`
will win, which is likely what the author intended.

Assume for a moment that you decide to ignore the common ordering and
alphabetize your link styles instead. This would yield the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:active {color: orange;}
a:focus {color: green;}
a:hover {color: red;}
a:link {color: blue;}
a:visited {color: purple;}
```

Given this ordering, no link would ever show `:hover`, `:focus`, or
`:active` styles because the `:link` and `:visited` rules come after the
other three. Every link must be either visited or unvisited, so those
styles will always override the others.

Let's consider a variation on the LVFHA order that an author might want
to use. In this ordering, only unvisited links will get a hover style;
visited links will not. Both visited and unvisited links will get an
active style:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link {color: blue;}
a:hover {color: red;}
a:visited {color: purple;}
a:focus {color: green;}
a:active {color: orange;}
```

Such conflicts arise only when all the states attempt to set the same
property. If each state's styles address a different property, the order
does not matter. In the following case, the link styles could be given
in any order and would still function as intended:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link {font-weight: bold;}
a:visited {font-style: italic;}
a:focus {color: green;}
a:hover {color: red;}
a:active {background: yellow;}
```

You may also have realized that the order of the `:link` and `:visited`
styles doesn't matter. You could order the styles LVFHA or VLFHA with no
ill effect.

The ability to chain pseudo-classes together eliminates all these
worries. The following could be listed in any order without any
overrides, as the specificity of the latter two is greater than that of
the first two:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link {color: blue;}
a:visited {color: purple;}
a:link:hover {color: red;}
a:visited:hover {color: gray;}
```

Because each rule applies to a unique set of link states, they do not
conflict. Therefore, changing their order will not change the styling of
the document. The last two rules do have the same specificity, but that
doesn't matter. A hovered unvisited link will not be matched by the rule
regarding hovered visited links, and vice versa. If we were to add
active-state styles, order would start to matter again. Consider this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link {color: blue;}
a:visited {color: purple;}
a:link:hover {color: red;}
a:visited:hover {color: gray;}
a:link:active {color: orange;}
a:visited:active {color: silver;}
```

If the active styles were moved before the hover styles, they would be
ignored. Again, this would happen because of specificity conflicts. The
conflicts could be avoided by adding more pseudo-classes to the chains,
like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link:hover:active {color: orange;}
a:visited:hover:active {color: silver;}
```

This does have the effect of raising the specificity of the
selectors---both have a specificity value of `0,3,1`---but they don't
conflict because the actual selection states are mutually exclusive. A
link can't be both a visited hovered active link *and* an unvisited
hovered active link: only one of the two rules will
match.[]{#ch04.xhtml_idm45797107067360 primary=""

Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of Cascading Style Sheets is the
cascade itself---the process used to sort out conflicting declarations
and determine the final document presentation. Integral to this process
is the specificity of selectors and their associated declarations, and
the mechanism of inheritance.

In this chapter, we'll tackle features that are the basis for almost
everything you can do with CSS: the units that affect the colors,
distances, and sizes of a whole host of properties, as well as the units
that help define those values. Without units, you couldn't declare that
an image should have 10 pixels of blank space around it, or that a
heading's text should be a certain size. By understanding the concepts
put forth here, you'll be able to learn and use the rest of CSS much
more quickly.

For []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_values_keyword primary="values"
secondary="keywords"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_ix_keyword_value
primary="keywords, as values" data-type="indexterm"}those times when a
value needs to be described with a word of some kind, CSS has
*keywords*. A common example is the keyword `none`, which is distinct
from `0` (zero). Thus, to remove the underline from links in an HTML
document, you would write the [following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href] {text-decoration: none;}
```

Similarly, if you want to force underlines on the links, you would use
the keyword `underline` instead of `none`.

If a property accepts keywords, its keywords will be defined only for
the scope of that property. If two properties use the same word as a
keyword, the behavior of the keyword for one property will not
necessarily be shared with the other. As an example, `normal`, as

### Global keywords {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_233}

CSS []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_global_key primary="global keywords"
data-type="indexterm"}defines five *global* keywords that are accepted
by every property in the specification: `inherit`, `initial`, `unset`,
`revert`, and `revert-layer`.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="inherit" data-type="sect4"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_inherit .sect4}
#### inherit {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_234}

The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106939216 primary="inherit global keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}keyword `inherit` makes the value of a property on
an element the same as the value of that property on its parent element.
In other words, it forces inheritance to occur even in situations where
it would not normally operate. In many cases, you don't need to specify
inheritance, since many properties inherit naturally. Nevertheless,
`inherit` can still be useful.

For example, consider the following styles and markup:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
#toolbar {background: blue; color: white;}

<div id="toolbar">
<a href="one.xhtml">One</a> | <a href="two.xhtml">Two</a> |
<a href="three.xhtml">Three</a>
</div>
```

The `<div>` itself will have a blue background and a white foreground,
but the links will be styled according to the browser's preference
settings. They'll most likely end up as blue text on a blue background,
with white vertical bars between them.

You could write a rule that explicitly sets the links in the toolbar to
be white, but you can make things a little more robust by using
`inherit`. You just add the following rule to the stylesheet:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#toolbar a {color: inherit;}
```

This will cause the links to use the inherited value of `color` in place
of the user agent's default styles.

Ordinarily, directly assigned styles override inherited styles, but
`inherit` can undo that behavior. It might not always be a good
idea---for example, here links might blend into surrounding text too
much, and become a usability and accessibility concern---but it can be
done.

Similarly, you can pull a property value down from a parent even if it
wouldn't happen normally. Take `border`, for example, which is
(rightfully) not inherited. If you want a `<span>` to inherit the border
of its parent, all you need is `span {border: inherit;}`. More likely,
though, you just want the border on a `<span>` to use the same border
color as its parent. In that case, `span {border-color: inherit;}` will
do the trick.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="initial" data-type="sect4"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_initial .sect4}
#### initial {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_235}

The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106898752 primary="initial global keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}keyword `initial` sets the value of a property to
the defined initial value, which, in a way, means it "resets" the value.
For example, the default value of `font-weight` is `normal`. Therefore,
declaring `font-weight: initial` is the same as declaring
[`font-weight: normal`.]{.keep-together}

This might seem a little bit silly until you consider that not all
values have explicitly defined initial values. For example, the initial
value for `color` "depends on user agent." That's not a funky keyword
you should type! What it means is that the default value of `color`
depends on things like the preference settings in a browser. While
almost nobody changes the default text color setting from black, someone
might set it to a dark gray or even a bright red. By declaring
`color: initial;`, you're telling the browser to set the color of the
element to whatever the user's default color is set to be.

Another benefit of `initial` is that you can set a property back to its
initial value without having to know that initial value. This can be
especially useful when resetting a lot of properties all at once, either
via JS or CSS.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="unset" data-type="sect4"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_unset .sect4}
#### unset {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_236}

The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106878432 primary="unset keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}keyword `unset` acts as a universal stand-in for
both `inherit` and `initial`. If the property is inherited, `unset` has
the same effect as if `inherit` were used. If the property is *not*
inherited, `unset` has the same effect as if `initial` were used. This
makes `unset` useful for resetting a property by canceling out any other
styles that might be applied to it.
:::
::::

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="revert" data-type="sect4"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_revert .sect4}
#### revert {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_237}

The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106871456 primary="revert keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}keyword `revert` sets the value of a property to
the value the property would have had if no changes had been made by the
current style origin. In effect, `revert` lets you say, "All property
values for this element should be as if the author styles don't exist,
but user agent and user styles do exist."

Thus, given the following basic example, `p` elements will be rendered
as gray text with a transparent background:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background: lime; color: gray;}
p {background: revert;}
```

This does mean that any property whose value is inherited will be given
the same value as that of its parent. The `revert` keyword is useful
when you have a bunch of site-wide styles applying to an element, and
you want to strip them all away so as to apply a set of one-off styles
to just that element. Rather than having to override all those
properties, you can revert them to defaults---and you can do it with a
single property, `all`, which is the topic of the next section.

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="revert-layer" data-type="sect4"}
:::: {#ch05.xhtml_revert-layer .sect4}
#### revert-layer {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_238}

If you're using []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106850768
primary="revert-layer keyword" data-type="indexterm"}cascade layers (see
["Sorting by Cascade
Layer"](../Text/ch04.xhtml#sorting_by_layer){data-type="xref"}) and want
to "undo" whatever styles might be applied by the current layer, the
`revert-layer` value is here to help. The difference here is that
`revert-layer` effectively means, "All property values for this element
should be as if the author styles *in the current cascade layer* don't
exist, but other author cascade layers (including the default), user
agent, and user styles do exist."

Thus, given the following, paragraphs with a `class` containing the word
`example` will be rendered as red text on a yellow background:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@layer site, system;

p {color: red;}
@layer system {
	p {background: yellow; color: fuchsia;}
}
@layer site {
	p {background: lime; color: gray;}
	p.example {background: revert; color: revert;}
}
```

For the background, the browser looks at the assigned values in previous
cascade layers and picks the one with the highest weight. Only one layer
(`system`) sets a background color, so that's what's used instead of
`lime`. The same is done for the foreground color, and since a color is
assigned in the default layer, and the default layer overrides all
explicitly created layers, `red` is used instead of
`gray`.[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106734320 primary=""

The `all` property is a []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106717200
primary="direction property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106716464

properties *except* `direction`, `unicode-bidi`, and any custom
properties (see ["Custom
Properties"](#ch05.xhtml_custom_properties){data-type="xref"}). Thus, if
you declare `all: inherit` on an element, you're saying that you want
all properties except `direction`, `unicode-bidi`, and custom properties
to inherit their values from the element's parent. Consider the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {color: white; background: black; font-weight: bold;}
#example {all: inherit;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<section>
    <div id="example">This is a div.</div>
</section>
```

You might think this causes the `<div>` element to inherit the values of
`color`, `background`, and `font-weight` from the `<section>` element.
And it does do that, yes---but it will *also* force inheritance of the
values of *every single other property in CSS* (minus the two
exceptions) from the `<section>` element.

Maybe that's what you want, in which case, great. But if you just want
to inherit the property values you wrote out for the `<section>`
element, the CSS would need to look more like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {color: white; background: black; font-weight: bold;}
#example {color: inherit; background: inherit; font-weight: inherit;}
```

Odds are that what you really want in these situations is `all: unset`,
but your stylesheet may vary.

single or double quotes, and is represented in value definitions with
\<*`string`*\>. Here are two simple [examples:]{.keep-together}

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
"I like to play with strings."
'Strings are fun to play with.'
```

Note that the quotes balance, which is to say that you always start and
end with the same kind of quotes. Getting this wrong can lead to all
kinds of parsing problems, since starting with one kind of quote and
trying to end with the other means the string won't actually be
terminated. You could accidentally incorporate subsequent rules into the
string that way!

If you want to put []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106587168 primary="slashes"

primary="backslash (\\), escape character" data-type="indexterm"}quote
marks inside strings, that's OK, as long as they're either not the kind
you used to enclose the string or are escaped using a backslash:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
"I've always liked to play with strings."
'He said to me, "I like to play with strings."'
"It's been said that \"haste makes waste.\""
'There\'s never been a "string theory" that I\'ve liked.'
```

Note that the only acceptable string delimiters are `'` and `"`,
sometimes called *straight quotes*. That means you can't use *curly* or
*smart* quotes to begin or end a string value. You can use them inside a
string value, as in this code example, though, and they don't have to be
escaped:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
"It’s been said that “haste makes waste.”"
'There’s never been a “string theory” that I’ve liked.'
```

This requires that you use Unicode encoding (using the [Unicode
standard](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.xhtml)) for your
documents, but you should be doing that regardless.

If you have some reason to include a []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106578336
primary="newline character, in strings" data-type="indexterm"}newline in
your string value, you can do that by escaping the newline itself. CSS
will then remove it, making things as if it had never been there. Thus,
the following two string values are identical from a CSS point of view:

``` {.pagebreak-before data-type="programlisting"}
"This is the right place \
for a newline."
"This is the right place for a newline."
```

If, on the other []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106548912
primary="Unicode encoding" data-type="indexterm"}hand, you actually want
a string value that includes a newline character, use the Unicode
reference `\A` where you want the newline to occur:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
"This is a better place \Afor a newline."

data-type="indexterm"}case-sensitive strings that should not be quoted
are known as *identifiers*, represented in the CSS syntax as
\<*`ident`*\> or \<*`custom-ident`*\>, depending on the specification
and context. Identifiers are used as animation names, grid-line names,
and counter names, among others. In addition, \<*`dashed-ident`*\> is
used for custom properties. Rules for creating a custom identifier
include not starting the word with a number, a double hyphen, or a
single hyphen followed by a number. Other than that, really any
character is valid, including emojis, but if you use certain characters,
including a space or a backslash, you need to escape them with a
backslash.

Identifiers themselves are words and are case-sensitive; thus, `myID`
and `MyID` are, as far as CSS is concerned, completely distinct and
unrelated to each other. If a property accepts both an identifier and
one or more keywords, the author should take care to never define an
identifier that is identical to a valid keyword, including the global
keywords `initial`, `inherit`, `unset`, and `revert`. Using `none` is
also a really bad idea.

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="URLs" data-type="sect2"}

## URLs {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_244}

If you've []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_value_url primary="values" secondary="URLs"
data-type="indexterm"}written web pages, you're almost certainly
familiar with uniform resource locators (URLs). Whenever you need to
refer to one---as in the `@import` statement, which is used when
importing an external stylesheet---here is the general format:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
url(protocol://server/pathname/filename)
url("<string>")   /* can use single or double quotes, or no quotes. */
```

This example []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106528336 primary="absolute URL"
data-type="indexterm"}defines an *absolute URL*. This URL will work no
matter where (or rather, in what page) it's found, because it defines an
absolute location in web space. Let's say that you have a server called
*web.waffles.org*. On that server is a directory called *pix*, and in
this directory is an image *waffle22.gif*. In this case, the absolute
URL of that image would be as follows:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
https://web.waffles.org/pix/waffle22.gif
```

This URL is valid no matter where it is written, whether the page
containing it is located on the server *web.waffles.org* or
*web.pancakes.com*.

The []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_urls_images primary="URLs, images specified by"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_ix_rel_url primary="relative URLs"
data-type="indexterm"}other type of URL is a *relative URL*, so named
because it specifies a location that is relative to the document that
uses it. If you're referring to a relative location, such as a file in
the same directory as your web page, the general format is as follows:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
url(pathname)
url("<string>")   /* can use single or double quotes. */
```

This works only if the image is on the same server as the page that
contains the URL. For argument's sake, assume that you have a web page
located at *http://web.waffles.org/syrup.xhtml* and that you want the
image *waffle22.gif* to appear on this page. In that case, the URL would
be the following:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
pix/waffle22.gif
```

This path works because the web browser knows it should start with the
place it found the web document and then add the relative URL. In this
case, the pathname *pix/waffle22.gif* added to the server name
*http://web.waffles.org* equals
*http://web.waffles.org/pix/waffle22.gif*. You can almost always use an
absolute URL in place of a relative URL; it doesn't matter which you
use, as long as it defines a valid location.

In CSS, relative URLs are relative to the stylesheet itself, not to the
HTML document that uses the stylesheet. For example, you may have an
external stylesheet that imports another stylesheet. If you use a
relative URL to import the second stylesheet, it must be relative to the
first stylesheet. In fact, if you have a URL in any imported stylesheet,
it needs to be relative to the imported stylesheet.

As an example, consider an HTML document at
*http://web.waffles.org/toppings/tips.xhtml*, which has a `<link>` to
the stylesheet *http://web.waffles.org/styles/basic.css*:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
    href="http://web.waffles.org/styles/basic.css">
```

Inside the file *basic.css* is an `@import` statement referring to
another stylesheet:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(special/toppings.css);
```

This `@import` will cause the browser to look for the stylesheet at
*http://web.waffles.org/styles/special/toppings.css*, not at
*http://web.waffles.org/toppings/special/toppings.css*. If you have a
stylesheet at the latter location, the `@import` in *basic.css* should
read one of the two following ways:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(http://web.waffles.org/toppings/special/toppings.css);

@import url("../special/toppings.css");
```

Note that there cannot be a space between the `url` and the opening
parenthesis:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background: url(http://www.pix.web/picture1.jpg);}   /* correct */
body {background: url  (images/picture2.jpg);}          /* INCORRECT */
```

If the space is present, the entire declaration will be invalidated and
thus ignored.[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106383472 primary=""

An *image value* is a []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106375856 primary="values"
secondary="images"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106374848 primary="images"
secondary="value types" data-type="indexterm"}reference to an image, as
you might have guessed. Its syntax representation is \<*`image`*\>.

At the most basic level of support, which is to say the one every CSS
engine on the planet would understand, an \<*`image`*\> value is a
\<*`url`*\> value. In more modern user agents, \<*`image`*\> stands for
one of the following:

\<*`url`*\>

:   A []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106368720 primary="<url> value type"
    primary-sortas="url value type" data-type="indexterm"}URL identifier
    of an external resource---in this case, the URL of an image.

    primary="<gradient> value type" primary-sortas="gradient value type"
    data-type="indexterm"} to either a linear, radial, or conic gradient
    image, either singly or in a repeating pattern. Gradients are fairly
    complex and are covered in detail in
    [Chapter 9](../Text/ch09.xhtml#gradients){data-type="xref"}.

\<*`image-set`*\>

:   A []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106349136 primary="<image-set> value type"
    primary-sortas="image-set value type" data-type="indexterm"}set of
    images, chosen based on a set of conditions embedded into the value,
    which is defined as `image-set()` but is more widely recognized with
    the `-webkit-` prefix. For example, `-webkit-image-set()` could
    specify that a larger image be used for desktop layouts, whereas a
    smaller image (both in pixel size and file size) be used for a
    mobile design. This value is intended to at least approximate the
    behavior of the `srcset` attribute for `<picture>` elements. As of
    early 2023, `-webkit-image-set` is basically universally supported,
    with most browsers other than Safari also accepting `image-set()`
    (without the prefix).

\<*`cross-fade`*\>

:   Used to []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106343040
    primary="<cross-fade> value type"
    primary-sortas="cross-fade value type" data-type="indexterm"}blend
    two (or more) images together, with a specific transparency given to
    each image. Use cases include blending two images together, blending
    an image with a gradient, and so on. As of early 2023, this is
    supported as `-webkit-cross-fade()` in Blink- and WebKit-based
    browsers, and not supported at all in the Firefox family, with or
    without the prefix.

There are also the `image()` and `element()` functions, but as of early
2023, neither is supported by any browser, except for a vendor-prefixed
version of `element()` supported by Firefox. Finally, `paint()` refers
to an image painted by CSS Houdini's PaintWorklet. As of early 2023,
this is supported in only a basic form by Blink-based browsers like

# Numbers and Percentages {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_247}

Numbers and []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_value_number primary="values"
secondary="numbers" data-type="indexterm"}percentages serve as the
foundation for many other values types. For example, font sizes can be
defined using the `em` unit (covered later in this chapter) preceded by
a number. But what kind of number? Understanding the types of numbers
here will help you better grasp defining other value types later.

## Integers {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_248}

An *integer value* is []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106332272
primary="<integer> value type" primary-sortas="integer value type"
data-type="indexterm"}about as simple as it gets: one or more numbers,
optionally prefixed by a `+` or `–` (plus or minus) sign to indicate a
positive or negative value. That's it. Integer values are represented in
value syntax as \<*`integer`*\>. Examples include `712`, `13`, `−42`,
and `1066`.

Some properties define a range of acceptable integer values. Integer
values that fall outside a defined range are, by default, considered
invalid and cause the entire declaration to be ignored. However, some
properties define behavior that causes values outside the accepted range
to be set to the accepted value closest to the declared value, known as
*clamping*.

In cases (such as the property `z-index`) where there is no restricted
range, user agents must support values up to ±1,073,741,824 (±2^30^).

## Numbers {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_249}

A *number value* is []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106323072
primary="<number> value type" primary-sortas="number value type"
data-type="indexterm"}either an \<*`integer`*\> or a real number, which
is to say an integer followed by a dot and then some number of following
integers. Additionally, it can be prefixed by either `+` or `-` to
indicate positive or negative values. Number values are represented in
value syntax as \<*`number`*\>. Examples include `5`, `2.7183`,
`−3.1416`, `6.2832`, and `1.0218e29` (scientific notation).

The reason a \<*`number`*\> can be an \<*`integer`*\> and yet they are
separate value types is that some properties will accept only integers
(e.g., `z-index`), whereas others will accept any real number (e.g.,
`flex-grow`).

As with integer values, number values may have limits imposed on them by
a property definition; for example, `opacity` restricts its value to be
any valid \<*`number`*\> in the range `0` to `1`, inclusive. Some
properties define behavior that causes values outside the accepted range
to be clamped to an acceptable value closest to the declared value;
e.g., `opacity: 1.7` would be clamped to `opacity: 1`. For those that do
not, number values that fall outside a defined range are considered
invalid and cause the entire declaration to be ignored.

is represented in value syntax as \<*`percentage`*\>. Examples include
`50%` and `33.333%`. Percentage values are always relative to another
value, which can be anything---the value of another property [of
the]{.keep-together} same element, a value inherited from the parent
element, or a value of an ancestor element. Properties that accept
percentage values will define any restrictions on the range of allowed
percentage values, as well as the way in which the percentage is
[relatively calculated.]{.keep-together}

A *fraction value* (or *flexible ratio*) is a \<*`number`*\> followed by
the `fr` unit label. []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106299424

the number. Fraction values are not lengths (nor are they compatible
with \<*`length`*\> values, unlike some \<*`percentage`*\> values), so
they cannot be used with other unit types in `calc()` functions.

Many CSS properties, such as margins, depend on length measurements to
properly display various page elements. It's likely no surprise, then,
CSS provides multiple ways to measure length.

All length units can be expressed as either positive or negative numbers
followed by a label, although note that some properties will accept only
positive numbers. You can also use real numbers---that is, numbers with
decimal fractions, such as 10.5 or 4.561.

All length units are followed by a short abbreviation that represents
the actual unit of length being specified, such as `in` (inches) or `pt`
(points). The only exception to this rule is a length of `0` (zero),
which need not be followed by a unit when describing lengths.

These length units are divided into two types: *absolute length units*
and *relative length units*.

:::::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Absolute Length Units" data-type="sect2"}
::::::: {#ch05.xhtml_absolute_length_units .sect2}
## Absolute Length Units {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_254}

We'll []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_units_absol_length primary="units of measure"
secondary="absolute length"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_ix_absol_length
primary="absolute length units" data-type="indexterm"}start with
absolute units because they're easiest to understand. The seven types of
absolute units are as follows:

*Inches* (`in`)

:   As []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106276624 primary="in (inches) unit"
    data-type="indexterm"}you might expect, this notation refers to the
    inches you'd find on a ruler in the US. (The fact that this unit is
    in the specification, even though almost the entire world uses the
    metric system, is an interesting insight into the pervasiveness of
    US interests on the internet---but let's not get into virtual
    sociopolitical theory right now.)

*Centimeters* (`cm`)

:   Refers[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106273744
    primary="cm (centimeters) unit" data-type="indexterm"} to the
    centimeters that you'd find on rulers the world over. There are 2.54
    centimeters to an inch, and one centimeter equals 0.394 inches.

*Millimeters* (`mm`)

:   For those []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106270864
    primary="mm (millimeters) unit" data-type="indexterm"}Americans who
    are metric challenged, 10 millimeters are in 1 centimeter, so an
    inch equals 25.4 millimeters, and a millimeter equals 0.0394 inches.

*Quarter-millimeters* (`Q`)

:   There[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106267824
    primary="q (quarter-millimeters) unit" data-type="indexterm"} are 40
    Q units in a centimeter; thus, setting an element to be 1/10 of a
    centimeter wide---which is also a millimeter wide---would mean a
    value of `4Q`.

*Points* (`pt`)

:   Points[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106264144 primary="pt (points) unit"
    data-type="indexterm"} are standard typographical measurements that
    have been used by printers and typesetters for decades and by word
    processing programs for many years. Traditionally, there are 72
    points to an inch. Therefore the capital letters of text set to 12
    points should be one-sixth of an inch tall. For example,
    `p {font-size`: `18pt;}` is equivalent to `p {font-size`:
    `0.25in;}`.

*Picas* (`pc`)

:   A []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106259600 primary="pc (picas) unit"
    data-type="indexterm"}pica, which is another typographical term, is
    equivalent to 12 points, which means there are 6 picas to an inch.
    As just shown, the capital letters of text set to 1 pica should be
    one-sixth of an inch tall. For example, `p {font-size`: `1.5pc;}`
    would set text to the same size as the example declarations found in
    the definition of points.

*Pixels* (`px`)

:   A []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106255744 primary="px (pixels) unit"
    data-type="indexterm"}pixel is a small box onscreen, but CSS defines
    pixels more abstractly. In CSS terms, a pixel is defined to be the
    size required to yield 96 pixels per inch. Many user agents ignore
    this definition in favor of simply addressing the pixels on the
    screen. Scaling factors are brought into play when page zooming or
    printing, where an element `100px` wide can be rendered more than
    100 device dots wide.

These units are really useful only if the browser knows all the details
of the screen on which your page is displayed, the printer you're using,
or whatever other user agent might apply. On a web browser, display is
affected by the size of the screen and the resolution to which the
screen is set; there isn't much that you, as the author, can do about
these factors. If nothing else, measurements should be consistent in
relation to each other---that is, a setting of `1.0in` should be twice
as large as `0.5in`, as shown in
[Figure 5-1](#ch05.xhtml_setting_absolute-length_left_margins){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">

Let's make the (fairly suspect) assumption that your computer knows
enough about its display system to accurately reproduce real-world
measurements. You could make sure every paragraph has a top margin of
half an inch by declaring `p {margin-top`: `0.5in;}` in that case.

Absolute units are much more useful in defining stylesheets for printed
documents, where measuring things in terms of inches, points, and picas
is common.

### Pixel lengths {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_256}

On the face of things, []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106246432 primary="pixels"
data-type="indexterm"}pixels are straightforward. If you look at a
screen closely enough, you can see that it's broken into a grid of tiny
little boxes. Each box is a pixel. Say you define an element to be a
certain number of pixels tall and wide, as in the following markup:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>
The following image is 20 pixels tall and wide: <img src="test.gif"
  style="width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="" />
</p>
```

Then it follows that the element will be that many screen elements tall
and wide, as shown in
[Figure 5-2](#ch05.xhtml_using_pixel_lengths){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">

<h6 id="ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_257"><span class="label">Figure 5-2.
</span>Using pixel lengths</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The problem is, thanks to high-density displays like those found on
mobile devices and modern laptops, the individual screen elements aren't
treated as pixels anymore. Instead, the pixels used in your CSS are
translated into something that aligns with human expectations, which is
covered in the next section.
:::

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Pixel theory" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_pixel_theory .sect3}
### Pixel theory {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_258}

In its discussion of pixels, the CSS specification recommends that, when
a display's resolution density is significantly different from 96 pixels
per inch (ppi), user agents should scale pixel measurements to a
reference pixel.

The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#reference-pixel) defines
*reference pixel* as follows:

> The visual angle of one pixel on a device with a device pixel density
> of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm's length. For a
> nominal arm's length of 28 inches, the visual angle is therefore about
> 0.0213 degrees. For reading at arm's length, 1px thus corresponds to
> about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).

On most modern displays, the actual number of pixels per inch (ppi) is
higher than 96---sometimes much higher. The Retina display on an iPhone
13, for example, is physically 326 ppi, and the display on the iPad Pro
is physically 264 ppi. As long as a browser on one of those devices sets
the reference pixel such that an element set to be `10px` tall appears
to be 2.6 millimeters tall on the screen, the physical display density
isn't something you have to worry about, any more than having to worry
about the number of dots per inch on [a printout.]{.keep-together}

primary="resolution units"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106208736
primary="units of measure" secondary="resolution"
data-type="indexterm"}unit types are based on display resolution:

*Dots per inch* (`dpi`)

:   The number[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106205232
    primary="dpi (dots per inch) unit" data-type="indexterm"} of display
    dots per linear inch. This can refer to the dots on a paper
    printer's output, the physical pixels on an LED screen or other
    device, or the elements in an e-ink display such as that used by a
    Kindle.

*Dots per centimeter* (`dpcm`)

:   Same[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106202384
    primary="dpcm (dots per centimeter) unit" data-type="indexterm"} as
    `dpi`, except the linear measure is 1 centimeter instead of 1 inch.

*Dots per pixel unit* (`dppx`)

:   The number[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106176880
    primary="dppx (dots per pixel) unit"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106176176
    primary="pixels" data-type="indexterm"} of display dots per CSS `px`
    unit, with `1dppx` being equivalent to `96dpi` because CSS defines
    pixel units at that ratio. Just bear in mind that ratio could change
    in future versions of CSS.

These units are most often used in the context of media queries. As an
example, an author can create a media block to be used only on displays
that have higher than 500 dpi:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media (min-resolution: 500dpi) {
    /* rules go here */
}
```

Again, it's important to remember that CSS pixels are *not* device
resolution pixels. Text with `font-size: 16px` will be a relatively
consistent size whether the device has 96 dpi or 470 dpi. While a
reference pixel is defined to appear to be 1/96th of an inch in size,
when a device has more than 96 dpi, the content will not look smaller.
Zooming is created by expanding CSS pixels as much as is needed; an
image will appear larger, but the image size doesn't actually change:
rather, the width of the screen, in terms of reference pixels, gets
smaller.[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106159584 primary=""

## Relative Length Units {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_260}

Relative []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_units_relative_length
primary="units of measure" secondary="relative length"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_ix_relative_units
primary="relative length units" data-type="indexterm"}units are so
called because they are measured in relation to other things. The actual
(or absolute) distance they measure can change because of factors beyond
their control, such as screen resolution, the width of the viewing area,
the user's preference settings, and a whole host of other things. In
addition, for some relative units, their size is almost always relative
to the element that uses them and will thus change from element to
element.

First, let's consider the character-based length units, including `em`,
`ex`, and `ch`, which are closely related. Two other font-relative
units, `cap` and `ic`, are discussed later in [the
chapter.]{.keep-together}

:::: {.section .less_space .pagebreak-before pdf-bookmark="The em unit" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_the_em_unit .sect3}
### The em unit {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_261}

In CSS, `1em` is []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797106126704 primary="em unit"
data-type="indexterm"}defined to be the value of `font-size` for a given
font. If the `font-size` of an element is 14 pixels, then for that
element, `1em` is equal to 14 pixels.

As you may suspect, this value can change from element to element. For
example, let's say you have an `<h1>` with a font size of 24 pixels, an
`<h2>` element with a font size of 18 pixels, and a paragraph with a
font size of 12 pixels. If you set the left margin of all three at
`1em`, they will have left margins of 24 pixels, 18 pixels, and 12
pixels, respectively:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-size: 24px;}
h2 {font-size: 18px;}
p {font-size: 12px;}
h1, h2, p {margin-left: 1em;}
small {font-size: 0.8em;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>Left margin = <small>24 pixels</small></h1>
<h2>Left margin = <small>18 pixels</small></h2>
<p>Left margin = <small>12 pixels</small></p>
```

When setting the size of the font, on the other hand, the value of `em`
is relative to the font size of the parent element, as illustrated in
[Figure 5-3](#ch05.xhtml_using_em_for_margins_and_font_sizing){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">

</span>Using <code>em</code> for margins and font sizing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In theory, `1em` is equal to the width of a lowercase *m* in the font
used---that's where the name comes from, in fact. It's an old
typographer's term. However, this is not assured in CSS.

The `ex` []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797088171824 primary="ex unit"
data-type="indexterm"}unit refers to the height of a lowercase *x* in
the font being used. Therefore, if two paragraphs use text that is 24
points in size, but each paragraph uses a different font, then the value
of `ex` could be different for each paragraph. This is because different
fonts have different heights for *x*, as you can see in
[Figure 5-4](#ch05.xhtml_varying_x-heights){data-type="xref"}. Even
though the examples use 24-point text---and therefore each example's
`em` value is 24 points---the x-height for each [is
different.]{.keep-together}

::: {#ch05.xhtml_the_ch_unit .sect3}
### The ch unit {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_265}

The `ch` []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797088127648 primary="ch unit"
data-type="indexterm"}unit is broadly meant to represent *one
character*. [CSS Values and Units Level
4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-4/#ch) defines `ch` as follows:

> Equal to the advance measure of the "0" (ZERO, U+0030) glyph found in
> the font used to render it.

The term *advance measure* is a []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797088123712
primary="advance measure" data-type="indexterm"}CSS-ism that corresponds
to the term *advance width* in Western typography. CSS uses the term
*measure* because some scripts are not right to left or left to right,
but instead top to bottom or bottom to top, and so may have an advance
height rather than an advance width.

Without getting into too many details, a character glyph's advance width
is the distance from the start of a character glyph to the start of the
next. This generally corresponds to the width of the glyph itself plus
any built-in spacing to the sides (although that built-in spacing can be
either positive or negative).

The easiest way to demonstrate the `ch` unit is to run a bunch of zeros
together and then set an image to have a width with the same number of
`ch` units as the number of zeros, as shown in
[Figure 5-5](#ch05.xhtml_character-relative_sizing){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {height: 1em; width: 25ch;}
```

Given a monospace font like Courier, all characters are by definition
`1ch` wide. In any proportional face type, which is what the vast
majority of Western typefaces are, characters may be wider or narrower
than the 0 and so cannot be assumed to be exactly [`1ch`
wide.]{.keep-together}

### Other relative length units {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_267}

We have a few other relative length units to mention:

`ic`

:   The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797088093040 primary="ic unit"
    data-type="indexterm"}advance measure of 水 glyph (Chinese,
    Japanese, and Korean water ideograph, U+6C34) found in the first
    font that can render it. This is like `ch` in that it uses an
    advance measure, but defines a measure more useful for ideographic
    languages than the 0 character. If `ic` can't be calculated for a
    given situation, it's assumed to be equal to `1em`.

`cap`

:   The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797088089328 primary="cap unit"
    data-type="indexterm"}cap-height is approximately equal to the
    height of a capital Latin letter, even in fonts that do not contain
    Latin letters. If it can't be calculated for a given situation, it's
    assumed to be equal to the font's ascent height.

`lh`

:   Equal[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797088087056 primary="lh unit"
    data-type="indexterm"} to the computed value of the `line-height`
    property of the element on which it is used.

At the time of this writing, only Firefox supports `cap`, and only
Chromium-based [browsers]{.keep-together} support `lh`.

## Root-Relative Length Units {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_268}

Most of the []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_root_relative_value
primary="root-relative values" data-type="indexterm"}character-based
length units discussed in the previous section have a corresponding
root-relative value. A *root-relative value* is one that is calculated
with respect to the root element of the document, and thus provides a
uniform value no matter what [context]{.keep-together} it's used in. We
will discuss the most widely supported such unit and then
[summarize]{.keep-together} the rest.

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="The rem unit" data-type="sect3"}
:::: {#ch05.xhtml_the_rem_unit .sect3}
### The rem unit {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_269}

The `rem` []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797088064112 primary="rem unit"
data-type="indexterm"}unit is calculated using the font size of the
document's root element. In HTML, that's the `<html>` element. Thus,
declaring any element to have `font-size: 1rem;` sets it to have the
same font-size value as the root element of the document.

As an example, consider the following markup fragment. It will have the
result shown in
[Figure 5-6](#ch05.xhtml_ems_versus_rems){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p> This paragraph has the same font size as the root element thanks to
    inheritance.</p>
<div style="font-size: 30px; background: silver;">
  <p style="font-size: 1em;">This paragraph has the same font size as its parent
     element.</p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem;">This paragraph has the same font size as the root
     element.</p>
</div>
```

<figure>

</span>Using the <code>em</code> unit (middle sentence) versus the
<code>rem</code> unit (bottom)</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In effect, `rem` acts as a reset for font size: no matter what relative
font sizing has happened to the ancestors of an element, giving it
`font-size: 1rem;` will put it right back where the root element is set.
This will usually be the user's default font size, unless you (or the
user) have set the root element to a specific font size.

For example, given this declaration, `1rem` will always be equivalent to
`13px`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html {font-size: 13px;}
```

However, given *this* declaration, `1rem` will always be equivalent to
three-quarters the user's default font size:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html {font-size: 75%;}
```

In this case, if the user's default is 16 pixels, `1rem` will equal
`12px`. If the user has set their default to 12 pixels---and yes, some
people do this---then `1rem` will equal `9px`. If the default setting is
20 pixels, `1rem` equals `15px`. And so on.

You are not restricted to the value `1rem`. Any real number can be used,
just as with the `em` unit, so you can do fun things like set all of
your headings to be multiples of the root [element's]{.keep-together}
font size:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-size: 2rem;}
h2 {font-size: 1.75rem;}
h3 {font-size: 1.4rem;}
h4 {font-size: 1.1rem;}
h5 {font-size: 1rem;}
h6 {font-size: 0.8rem;}
```

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_271}

`font-size: 1rem` is equivalent to `font-size: initial` as long as no
font size is set for the root element.

# Viewport-Relative Units {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_273}

CSS provides []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_viewport_rel_unit
primary="viewport-relative units" data-type="indexterm"}six
*viewport-relative size units*. These are calculated with respect to the
size of the viewport---browser window, printable area, mobile device
display, etc.:

*Viewport width unit* (`vw`)

:   Equal[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087835600
    primary="vw (viewport width) unit" data-type="indexterm"} to the
    viewport's width divided by 100. Therefore, if the viewport is 937
    pixels wide, `1vw` is equal to `9.37px`. If the viewport's width
    changes (say, by dragging the browser window wider or narrower), the
    value of `vw` changes along with it.

*Viewport height unit* (`vh`)

:   Equal[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087831200
    primary="vh (viewport height) unit" data-type="indexterm"} to the
    viewport's height divided by 100. Therefore, if the viewport is 650
    pixels tall, `1vh` is equal to `6.5px`. If the viewport's height
    changes (say, by dragging the browser window taller or shorter), the
    value of `vh` changes along with it.

*Viewport block unit* (`vb`)

:   Equal[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087826800
    primary="vb (viewport block) unit" data-type="indexterm"} to the
    size of the viewport along the block axis, divided by 100. The block
    axis is explained in
    [Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"}.
    In top-to-bottom languages like English or Arabic, `vb` will be
    equal to `vh` by default.

*Viewport inline unit* (`vi`)

:   Equal[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087822176
    primary="vi (viewport inline) unit" data-type="indexterm"} to the
    size of the viewport along the inline axis, divided by 100. The
    inline axis is explained in
    [Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"}.
    In horizontally written languages like English or Arabic, `vi` will
    be equal to `vw` by default.

*Viewport minimum unit* (`vmin`)

:   Equal[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087817504
    primary="vmin (viewport minimum) unit" data-type="indexterm"} to
    1/100th of the viewport's width or height, whichever is *less*.
    Thus, given a viewport that is 937 pixels wide by 650 pixels tall,
    `1vmin` is equal to `6.5px`.

*Viewport maximum unit* (`vmax`)

:   Equal[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087813296
    primary="vmax (viewport maximum) unit" data-type="indexterm"} to
    1/100th of the viewport's width or height, whichever is *greater*.
    Thus, given a viewport that is 937 pixels wide by 650 pixels tall,
    `1vmax` is equal to `9.37px`.

Because these are length units like any other, they can be used anywhere
a length unit is permitted. You can scale the font size of a heading in
terms of the viewport height, for example, with something like
`h1 {font-size: 10vh;}`. This sets the font size to be 1/10th the height
of the viewport---a technique potentially useful for article titles and
the like.

These units can be particularly handy for creating full-viewport
interfaces, such as those we expect to find on a mobile device, because
the units allow elements to be sized compared to the viewport and not to
any of the elements within the document tree. It's thus very simple to
fill up the entire viewport, or at least major portions of it, and not
have to worry about the precise dimensions of the actual viewport in any
particular case.

A basic example of viewport-relative sizing is illustrated in
[Figure 5-7](#ch05.xhtml_viewport-relative_sizing){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {width: 50vh; height: 33vw; background: gray;}
```

An interesting (though perhaps not useful) fact about these units is
that they aren't bound to their own primary axis. Thus, for example, you
can declare `width: 25vh;` to make an element as wide as one-quarter the
height of the viewport.

Variants of these units accommodate the vagaries of viewports and how
they can be sized, particularly on devices where the UI may expand and
contract based on user input. These variants are based on four viewport
types:

Default

:   The default viewport size, as defined by the user agent (browser).
    This viewport type is expected to correspond to the units `vw`,
    `vh`, `vb`, `vi`, `vmin`, and `vmax`. The default viewport may
    correspond to one of the other viewport types; e.g., the default
    viewport could be the same as the large viewport, but that's up to
    each browser to decide.

Large

:   The largest possible viewport after any user-agent interfaces are
    contracted to their fullest extent. For example, on a mobile device,
    the browser *chrome* (the browser's address bar, navigation bar, and
    so on) may be minimized or hidden most of the time so that the
    maximum screen area can be used to show page content. This is the
    state described by the large viewport. If you want an element's size
    to be determined by the full viewport area, even if that will lead
    to it being overlapped by the UI, the large-viewport units are the
    way to go. The units corresponding to this viewport type are `lvw`,
    `lvh`, `lvb`, `lvi`, `lvmin`, and `lvmax`.

Small

:   The smallest possible viewport after any user-agent interfaces are
    expanded to their fullest extent. In this state, the browser's
    chrome takes up as much screen space as it possibly can, leaving a
    minimum space for the page content. If you want to be sure an
    element's sizing will take into account any possible interface
    actions, use these units. The units corresponding to this viewport
    type are `svw`, `svh`, `svb`, `svi`, `svmin`, and `svmax`.

Dynamic

:   The area in which content is visible, which can change as the UI
    expands or contracts. As an example, consider how the browser
    interface can appear or disappear on mobile devices, depending on
    how the content is scrolled or where on the screen the user taps. If
    you want to set lengths based on the size of the viewport at every
    moment, regardless of how it changes, these are the units for you.
    The units corresponding to this viewport type are `dvw`, `dvh`,
    `dvb`, `dvi`, `dvmin`, and `dvmax`.

As of late 2022, scrollbars (if any) are ignored for the purposes of
calculating all of the previous units. Thus, the calculated size of
`svw` or `dvw` will *not* change if scrollbars appear or disappear, or
at least shouldn't.[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087747568 primary=""

## Calculation Values {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_276}

When you []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087638400 primary="calc() function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087637696
primary="mathematical expressions (calc() function)"
data-type="indexterm"}need to do a little math, CSS provides a `calc()`
value. Inside the parentheses, you can construct simple mathematical
expressions. The permitted operators are `+` (addition), `-`
(subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `/` (division), as well as
parentheses. These follow the traditional precedence order of
parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and
subtraction (PEMDAS), although in this case it's really just PMDAS since
exponents are not permitted in `calc()`.

As an example, suppose you want your paragraphs to have a width that's 2
em less than 90% the width of their parent element. Here's how you
express that with `calc()`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {width: calc(90% - 2em);}
```

The `calc()` value can be used with any property that permits one of the
following value types: \<*`length`*\>, \<*`frequency`*\>, \<*`angle`*\>,
\<*`time`*\>, \<*`percentage`*\>, \<*`number`*\>, or \<*`integer`*\>.
You can also use all these unit types within a `calc()` value, though
CSS has some limitations to keep in mind.

The basic limitation is that `calc()` does basic type checking to make
sure that units are, in effect, compatible. The checking works like
this:

1.  To either side of a `+` or `–` sign, both values must have the same
    unit type, or be a \<*`number`*\> and \<*`integer`*\> (in which
    case, the result is a \<*`number`*\>). Thus, `5 + 2.7` is valid, and
    results in `7.7`. On the other hand, `5em + 2.7` is invalid, because
    one side has a length unit and the other does not. Note that
    `5em + 20px` *is* valid, because `em` and `px` are both length
    units.

2.  Given a `*`, one of the values involved must be a \<*`number`*\>
    (which, remember, includes integer values). So `2.5rem * 2` and
    `2 * 2.5rem` are both valid, and each results in `5rem`. On the flip
    side, `2.5rem * 2rem` is *not* valid, because the result would be
    `5rem`^`2`^, and length units cannot be area units.

3.  Given a `/`, the value on the *right* side must be a \<*`number`*\>.
    If the left side is an \<*`integer`*\>, the result is a
    \<*`number`*\>. Otherwise, the result is of the unit type used on
    the left side. This means that `30em / 2.75` is valid, but
    `30 / 2.75em` is not.

4.  Furthermore, any circumstance that yields division by zero is
    invalid. This is easiest to see in a case like `30px/0`, but there
    are other ways to get there.

One more notable []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087575040 primary="whitespace"
secondary="calc() function and" data-type="indexterm"}limitation is that
whitespace is *required* on both sides of the `+` and `-` operators,
while it is not for `*` and `/`. This was done to allow future
development of `calc()` values to support keywords that contain hyphens
(e.g., `max-content`).

Furthermore, it's valid (and supported) to nest `calc()` functions
inside each other. Thus you can say something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {width: calc(90% - calc(1em + 0.1vh));}
```

Beyond that, the CSS specification requires that user agents support a
*minimum* of 20 terms inside any single `calc()` function, where a term
is a number, percentage, or dimension (e.g., a length). If the number of
terms somehow exceeds the user agent's term limits, the entire function
is treated as invalid.

Calculation is nice, but []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087549216
primary="maximum values, function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087548544
primary="min() function" data-type="indexterm"}sometimes you just want
to make sure a property is set to one of a number of values, whichever
is smallest. In those cases, the `min()` function value comes in very
handy. Yes, this is confusing at first, but give us a minute and
hopefully it will make sense.

Suppose you want to make sure that an element is never wider than a
certain amount; say, an image should be one-quarter the width of the
viewport or 200 pixels wide, whichever is *smaller*. This allows it to
be constrained to 200 pixels of width on wide viewports, but take up to
a quarter the width of smaller viewports. For that, you'd say the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.figure {width: min(25vw, 200px);}
```

The browser will compute the width of `25vw` and compare that to
`200px`, and use whichever is smaller. If `200px` is smaller than 25%
the width of the viewport, then `200px` will be used. Otherwise, the
element will be 25% as wide as the viewport, which could easily be
smaller than `1em`. Note that *smaller* in this case means closest to
negative infinity, not closest to zero. Thus, if you compare two terms
that compute to (say) `-1500px` and `-2px`, `min()` will pick `-1500px`.

You can nest `min()` inside `min()`, or throw a mathematical expression
in there for one of the values, without having to wrap it in `calc()`.
For that matter, you can put in `max()` and `clamp()`, which we haven't
even discussed yet. You can supply as many terms as you like: if you
want to compare four ways of measuring something and then pick the
minimum, just separate them with commas. Here's a slightly contrived
example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.figure {width: min(25vw, 200px, 33%, 50rem - 30px);}
```

Whichever of those values is computed to be the minimum (closest to
negative infinity) will be used, thus defining a maximum for the `width`
value. The order you list them in doesn't matter, since the minimum
value will always be picked regardless of where it appears in the
function.

In general, `min()` can be used in any property value that permits
\<*`length`*\>, \<*`frequency`*\>, \<*`angle`*\>, \<*`time`*\>,
\<*`percentage`*\>, \<*`number`*\>, or \<*`integer`*\>.

###### Warning {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_278}

Remember that setting a maximum value on font sizes is an accessibility
concern. You should *never* set a maximum font size using pixels,
because that would likely prevent text zooming by users. You probably
shouldn't use `min()` for font sizing in any case, but if you do, keep
`px` lengths out of the values!

## Minimum Values {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_279}

The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087455280 primary="minimum values, function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087454576
primary="max() function" data-type="indexterm"}mirror image of `min()`
is `max()`, which can be used to set a minimum value for a property. It
can appear in the same places and can be nested in the same ways as
`min()`, and is generally just the same except that it picks the largest
(closest to positive infinity) value from among the alternatives given.

As an example, perhaps the top of a page's design should be a minimum of
100 pixels tall, but it can be taller if conditions permit. In that
case, you could use something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header {height: max(100px, 15vh, 5rem);}
```

Whichever of the values is largest will be used. For a desktop browser
window, that would probably be `15vh`, unless the base size text is
really enormous. For a handheld display, it's more likely that `5rem` or
`100px` will be the largest value. In effect, this sets a minimum size
of 100 pixels tall, since getting either `15vh` or `5rem` below that
value is easily possible.

Remember that setting even a minimum value on font sizes can create an
accessibility problem, since a too-small minimum is still too small. A
good way to handle this is to always include `1rem` in your `max()`
expressions for font sizes. Use something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.sosumi {font-size: max(1vh, 0.75em, 1rem);}
```

Alternatively, you could not use `max()` for font sizing at all. It's
probably best left to box sizing and other such uses.

## Clamping Values {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_280}

If you've []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087379056
primary="clamping values, functions" data-type="indexterm"}already been
thinking about ways to nest `min()` and `max()` to set upper and lower
bounds on a value, there's a way to not only do that, but set an
"ideal" value as well: `clamp()`. This function value takes three
parameters representing, in order, the minimum allowed value, preferred
value, and maximum allowed value.

For example, consider some text you want to be about 5% the height of
the viewport, while keeping its minimum the base font size and its
maximum three times the text around it. That would be expressed like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
footer {font-size: clamp(1rem, 2vh, 3em);}
```

Given those styles and assuming the base font size is 16 pixels, as it
is by default in most browsers, then the footer text will be equal to
the base font size up to a viewport height of 800 pixels (16 divided by
0.02). If the viewport gets taller, the text will start to get bigger,
unless doing so would make it bigger than `3em`. If the text ever gets
to the same size as `3em`, it will stop growing. (This is fairly
unlikely, but one never knows.)

If the maximum value of a `clamp()` is ever computed to be smaller than
the minimum value, the maximum is ignored and the minimum value is used
instead.

You can use `clamp()` anywhere you can use `min()` and `max()`,
including nesting them inside each other. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
footer {font-size: clamp(1rem, max(2vh, 1.5em), 3em);}
```

This is basically the same as the previous example, except in this case
the preferred value is either 2% the height of the viewport or 1.5 times
the size of the parent element's text, whichever is larger.

primary="attributes" secondary="pulling in values from HTML"
data-type="indexterm"}CSS properties, it's possible to pull in the value
of an HTML attribute defined for the element being styled. You do this
with the `attr()` function.

For example, with generated content, you can insert the value of any
attribute. It looks something like this (don't worry about understanding
the exact syntax, which we'll explore in
[Chapter 16](../Text/ch16.xhtml#lists-and-generated-content){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p::before {content: "[" attr(id) "]";}
```

That expression would prefix any paragraph that has an `id` attribute
with the value of that `id`, enclosed in square brackets. Therefore,
applying the previous style to the following paragraphs would have the
result shown in
[Figure 5-8](#ch05.xhtml_inserting_attribute_values){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}

While `attr()` is supported in the `content` property value, it isn't
parsed. In other words, if the `attr()` returns an image URL from an
attribute value, the generated content will be the URL written out as
text, and not the image that lives at that URL. This is true as of late
2022, anyway; there are plans for changes such that `attr()` can be
parsed (and also be used for all properties, not just
`content`).[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087207456 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087197616
primary="color values" secondary="named colors"
data-type="indexterm"}years, CSS has added a set of 148 colors that are
identified by human-readable names like `red` or `firebrickred`. CSS
calls these, logically enough, *named colors*. In the early days, CSS
used only the 16 basic color keywords defined in HTML 4.01:

-   `aqua`

-   `gray`

-   `navy`

-   `silver`

-   `black`

-   `green`

-   `purple`

-   `white`

-   `fuchsia`

-   `maroon`

-   `red`

-   `yellow`

So, let's say you want all first-level headings to be maroon. The best
declaration would be as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: maroon;}
```

Simple enough, isn't it?
[Figure 5-9](#ch05.xhtml_naming_colors){data-type="xref"} shows a few
more examples:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

and get a light-green (but not exactly lime) color applied to `<h1>`
elements.

The CSS color specification includes those original 16 named colors in a
longer list of 148 color keywords. This extended list is based on the
standard X11 RGB values that have been in use for decades and recognized
by browsers for many years, with the addition of some color names from
SVG (mostly involving variants of "gray" and "grey") and a memorial
color.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Color Keywords" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_color_keywords .sect2}
## Color Keywords {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_286}

CSS has two special []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087093760
primary="transparent keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087093024
primary="currentcolor keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087061136
primary="color values" secondary="keywords"
data-type="indexterm"}keywords that can be used anywhere a color value
is permitted: `transparent` and `currentcolor`.

As its name suggests, `transparent` defines a completely transparent
color. The CSS Color Module defines it to be equivalent to
`rgb(0 0 0 / 0%)`, and that's its computed value. This keyword is not
often used to set text color, for example, but it is the default value
for element background colors. It can also be used to define element
borders that take up space but are not visible, and is often used when
defining gradients---​all topics we'll cover in later chapters.

By contrast, `currentcolor` means "whatever the computed value of
`color` is for this element." Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {color: gray; border-color: currentcolor;}
```

The first []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087007344 primary="colors"
secondary="foreground"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087006080
primary="foreground colors" data-type="indexterm"}declaration causes any
`<main>` elements to have a foreground color of `gray`. The second
declaration uses `currentcolor` to copy the computed value of
`color`---in this case `gray`---and apply it to any borders the `<main>`
elements might have. Incidentally, `currentcolor` is actually the
default value for `border-color`, which we'll cover in
[Chapter 7](../Text/ch07.xhtml#padding-borders-outlines-and-margins){data-type="xref"}.

As with all the named colors, these color names are case-insensitive. We
show `currentcolor` with mixed capitalization because it is generally
written that way for legibility.

Fortunately, CSS has more detailed and precise ways to specify colors.
The advantage is that, with these methods, you can specify any color in
the color spectrum, not just a limited list of named
colors.[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797087037312 primary=""

primary colors red, green, and blue---a combination often referred to as
*RGB color*. So, it makes sense that you should be able to specify your
own combinations of these primary colors in CSS. That solution is a bit
complex, but possible, and the payoffs are worth it because CSS has very
few limits on which colors you can produce. You can produce color in
this manner in four ways, detailed in this section.

:::: {#ch05.xhtml_functional_rgb_colors .sect3}
### Functional RGB colors {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_288}

Two color value types use *functional RGB notation* as opposed to
hexadecimal notation. The generic syntax for this type of color value is
`rgb(`*`color`*`)`, where *`color`* is expressed using a triplet of
either percentages or numbers. The percentage values can be in the range
`0%`--`100%`, and the integers can be in the range `0`--`255`.

Thus, to specify white and black, respectively, using percentage
notation, the values would be as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rgb(100%,100%,100%)
rgb(0%,0%,0%)
```

Using the integer-triplet notation, the same colors would be represented
as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rgb(255,255,255)
rgb(0,0,0)
```

An important thing to remember is that you can't mix integers and
percentages in the same color value. Thus, `rgb(255,66.67%,50%)` would
be invalid and thus ignored.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_289}

In more recent browsers, the separating commas in RGB values can be
replaced with simple whitespace. Thus, black can be represented as
`rgb(0 0 0)` or `rgb(0% 0% 0%)`. This is true of all the color values
that allow commas that we'll see throughout the chapter. Bear in mind
that some of the newer color functions do not allow commas.
:::

Assume you want your `<h1>` elements to be a shade of red that lies
between the values for red and maroon. The `red` value is equivalent to
`rgb(100%,0%,0%)`, whereas `maroon` is equal to `(50%,0%,0%)`. To get a
color between those two, you might try this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: rgb(75%,0%,0%);}
```

This makes the red component of the color lighter than `maroon`, but
darker than `red`. If, on the other hand, you want to create a pale-red
color, you would raise the green and blue levels:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: rgb(75%,50%,50%);}
```

The closest equivalent color using integer-triplet notation is shown
here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: rgb(191,127,127);}
```

The easiest way to visualize how these values correspond to color is to
create a table of gray values. The result is shown in
[Figure 5-10](#ch05.xhtml_text_set_in_shades_of_gray){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.one {color: rgb(0%,0%,0%);}
p.two {color: rgb(20%,20%,20%);}
p.three {color: rgb(40%,40%,40%);}
p.four {color: rgb(60%,60%,60%);}
p.five {color: rgb(80%,80%,80%);}
p.six {color: rgb(0,0,0);}
p.seven {color: rgb(51,51,51);}
p.eight {color: rgb(102,102,102);}
p.nine {color: rgb(153,153,153);}
p.ten {color: rgb(204,204,204);}
```

</div>
</figure>

Since we're dealing in shades of gray, all three RGB values are the same
in each statement. If any one were different from the others, a color
hue would start to emerge. If, for example, `rgb(50%,50%,50%)` were
modified to be `rgb(50%,50%,60%)`, the result would be a medium-dark
color with just a hint of blue.

You can use fractional numbers in percentage notation. You might, for
some reason, want to specify that a color be exactly 25.5% red, 40%
green, and 98.6% blue:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {color: rgb(25.5%,40%,98.6%);}
```

Values that fall outside the allowed range for each notation are
*clipped* to the nearest range edge, meaning that a value that is
greater than `100%` or less than `0%` will default to those allowed
extremes. Thus, the following declarations would be treated as if they
were the values indicated in the comments:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
P.one {color: rgb(300%,4200%,110%);}   /*  100%,100%,100%  */
P.two {color: rgb(0%,-40%,-5000%);}   /*  0%,0%,0%  */
p.three {color: rgb(42,444,-13);}    /* 42,255,0  */
```

Conversion between percentages and integers may seem arbitrary, but
there's no need to guess at the integer you want---there's a simple
formula for calculating them. If you know the percentages for each of
the RGB levels you want, you need only apply them to the number 255 to
get the resulting values. Let's say you have a color of 25% red, 37.5%
green, and 60% blue. Multiply each of these percentages by 255, and you
get 63.75, 95.625, and 153. Round these values to the nearest integers,
and voilà: `rgb(64,96,153)`.

If you already know the percentage values, there isn't much point in
converting them into integers. Integer notation is more useful for
people who use programs such as Adobe Photoshop, which can display
integer values in the Info dialog, or for those who are so familiar with
the technical details of color generation that they normally think in
values [of 0--255]{.keep-together}.[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797086562816

secondary="RGBa" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797086514320
primary="RGBa colors" data-type="indexterm"}notations can include a
fourth parameter defining the alphatransparency value. By adding an
alpha value at the end of the RGB triplet, `rgb()` accepts a
red-green-blue-alpha, or RGBa, value, with the alpha value being a
measurent of opacity.

While the `rgb()` notation allows for three or four values, the alpha
value must be present in the legacy `rgba()` function to be valid.

For example, suppose you want an element's text to be half-opaque white.
That way, any background color behind the text would "shine through,"
mixing with the half-transparent white. You could write one of the
following two values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rgb(255 255 255 / 0.5)
rgba(100% 100% 100% / 0.5)  /* commas would also be allowed */
```

To make a color completely transparent, you set the alpha value to `0`;
to be completely opaque, the correct value is `1`. Thus `rgb(0,0,0)` and
`rgba(0,0,0,1)` will yield precisely the same result (black).
[Figure 5-11](#ch05.xhtml_text_set_in_progressive_translucency){data-type="xref"}
shows a series of paragraphs set in increasingly transparent black,
which is the result of the following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.one {color: rgb(0,0,0,1);}
p.two {color: rgba(0%,0%,0%,0.8);}
p.three {color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.6);}
p.four {color: rgba(0% 0% 0% / 0.4);}
p.five {color: rgb(0,0,0,0.2);}

Alpha values are always real numbers in the range `0` to `1`, or
percentages in the range `0%` to `100%`. Any value outside that range
will either be ignored or reset to the nearest valid alpha value.

Computers have been using hex notation for quite some time now, and
programmers are typically either trained in its use or pick it up
through experience. Their familiarity with hexadecimal notation likely
led to its use in setting colors in HTML. That practice was carried over
to CSS.

Here's how it works: by stringing together three hexadecimal numbers in
the range `00` through `FF`, you can set a color. The generic syntax for
this notation is `#RRGGBB`. Note that there are no spaces, commas, or
other separators between the three numbers.

Hexadecimal notation is mathematically equivalent to integer-pair
notation. For example, `rgb(255,255,255)` is precisely equivalent to
`#FFFFFF`, and `rgb(51,102,128)` is the same as `#336680`. Feel free to
use whichever notation you prefer---it will be rendered identically by
most user agents. If you have a calculator that converts between decimal
and hexadecimal, making the jump from one to the other should be pretty
simple.

For hexadecimal numbers that are composed of three matched pairs of
digits, CSS permits a shortened notation. The generic syntax of this
notation is `#RGB`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {color: #000;}   /* set H1s to black */
h2 {color: #666;}   /* set H2s to dark gray */
h3 {color: #FFF;}   /* set H3s to white */
```

As you can see from the markup, each color value has only three digits.
However, since hexadecimal numbers between `00` and `FF` need two digits
each, and you have only three total digits, how does this method work?

The answer is that the browser takes each digit and replicates it.
Therefore, `#F00` is equivalent to `#FF0000`, `#6FA` would be the same
as `#66FFAA`, and `#FFF` would come out `#FFFFFF`, which is the same as
`white`. Not every color can be represented in this manner. Medium gray,
for example, would be written in standard hexadecimal notation as
`#808080`. This cannot be expressed in shorthand; the closest equivalent
would be `#888`, which is the same as `#888888`.

As with non-alpha hexadecimal values, you can shorten a value composed
of matched pairs to a four-digit value. Thus, a value of `#663399AA` can
be written as `#639A`. If the value has any pairs that are not
repetitive, the entire eight-digit value must be written out:
`#663399CA` cannot be shortened to `#639CA`.

## HSL and HSLa Colors {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_296}

Hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_hsl_colors2
primary="HSL colors" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_ix_hsl_colors
primary="color values" secondary="HSL colors"
data-type="indexterm"}color notation is similar to hue, saturation, and
brightness (HSB), the color system in image editing software like
Photoshop, and just as intuitive. The hue is expressed as an angle
value, saturation is a percentage value from 0% (no saturation) to 100%
(full saturation), and lightness is a percentage value from 0%
(completely dark) to 100% (completely light). If you're intimately
familiar with RGB, HSL may be confusing at first. (But then, RGB is
confusing for people familiar with HSL.)

The *hue* angle is expressed in terms of a circle around which the full
spectrum of colors progresses. It starts with red at 0 degrees and then
proceeds through the rainbow until it comes to red again at 360 degrees.
When the hue value is a unitless number, it is interpreted as degrees.

*Saturation* measures the intensity of a color. A saturation of `0%`
always yields a shade of gray, no matter what hue angle you have set,
and a saturation of `100%` creates the most vivid possible shade of that
hue (in the HSL color space) for a given lightness.

Similarly, *lightness* defines how dark or light the color appears. A
lightness of `0%` is always black, regardless of the other hue and
saturation values, just as a lightness of `100%` always yields white.
Consider the results of the following styles, illustrated on the left
side of [Figure 5-13](#ch05.xhtml_varying_lightness){data-type="xref"}.

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.one {color: hsl(0,0%,0%);}
p.two{color: hsl(60 0% 25%);}
p.three {color: hsl(120deg,0%,50%);}
p.four {color: hsl(180deg 0% 75%);}
p.five {color: hsl(0.667turn,0%,0%);}

be replaced with whitespace.
:::

The gray you see on the left side isn't just a function of the
limitations of print: every one of those paragraphs is a shade of gray,
because every color value has `0%` in the saturation (middle) position.
The degree of lightness or darkness is set by the lightness (third)
position. In all seven examples, the hue angle changes, and in none of
them does it matter.

But that's only so long as the saturation remains at `0%`. If that value
is raised to, say, `50%`, then the hue angle will become very important,
because it will control what sort of color you see. Consider the same
set of values that we saw before, but all set to `50%` saturation; this
is illustrated on the right side of

*hue*, *white* level, and *black* level by using the `hwb()` functional
value. This function value accepts hue values expressed as an angle
value. After the hue angle, instead of lightness and saturation,
whiteness and blackness values are specified as percentages.

Unlike HSL, however, there is no legacy `hwba()` function. Instead, the
value syntax for `hwb()` allows an opacity to be defined after the HWB
values, separated from them by a forward slash (`/`). The opacity can be
expressed either as a percentage or as a real value from 0 to 1,
inclusive. Also unlike HSL, commas are not supported: the HWB values can
only be separated by whitespace.

## Lab Colors {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_300}

Historically, all CSS []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085827968
primary="color values" secondary="Lab colors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085826960
primary="Lab colors" data-type="indexterm"}colors were defined in the
sRGB color space, which encompassed more colors than older display
monitors could represent. Modern displays, on the other hand, can handle
about 150% of the sRGB color space, which still isn't the full range of
color humans can perceive, but it's a lot closer.

In 1931, the *Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage* (International
Commission on Illumination, or CIE) defined a scientific system for
defining colors created via light, as opposed to those created with
paint or dyes. Now, almost a century later, CSS has brought the work of
the CIE into its repertoire.

It does this using the `lab()` function value to express color in the
CIE L\*a\*b\* (hereafter shortened as *Lab*) color space. Lab is
designed to represent the entire range of color that humans can see. The
`lab()` function accepts three to four parameters: `lab(`*`L`* *`a`*
*`b`* / *`A`*`)`. Similar to HWB, the parameters must be space-separated
(no commas allowed) and a forward slash (`/`) precedes the alpha value,
if provided.

The *`L`* (Lightness) component specifies the CIE lightness, and is a
\<*`percentage`*\> from `0%` representing black to `100%` representing
white, or a \<*`number`*\> from `0` to `1`. The second component, *`a`*,
is the distance along the a-axis in the Lab color space. This axis runs
from a purplish red in the positive direction to a shade of green in the
negative direction. The third component, *`b`*, is the distance along
the b-axis in the Lab color space. This axis runs from a yellow in the
positive direction to a blue-violet in the negative direction.

The fourth, optional parameter is the opacity, with a value from 0 to 1
inclusive, or 0% to 100% inclusive. If omitted, the opacity defaults to
1 (100%), or full opacity.

Here are some examples of Lab color expressed in CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
lab(29.2345% 39.3825 -20.0664);
lab(52.2345% 40.1645 59.9971);
lab(52.2345% 40.1645 59.9971 / .5);
```

The main reason to bring Lab (and LCH, which we'll discuss in a moment)
colors into CSS is that they are systematically designed to be
*perceptually uniform*: color values that share a given coordinate will
seem consistent in terms of that coordinate. Two colors with different
hues but the same lightness will appear to have similar lightnesses. Two
colors with the same hue but different lightnesses will appear to be
shades of a single hue. This is often not the case with RGB and HSL
values, so Lab and LCH represent a [big improvement.]{.keep-together}

They're also defined to be device independent, so you should be able to
specify colors in these color spaces and get a visually consistent
result from one device to another.

## LCH Colors {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_302}

*Lightness Chroma Hue (LCH)* is a []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085734080
primary="color values" secondary="LCH colors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085705312
primary="LCH colors" data-type="indexterm"}version of Lab designed to
represent the entire spectrum of human vision. It does this using a
different notation: `lch(`*`L`* *`C`* *`H`* / *`A`*`)`. The main
difference is that *`C`* and *`H`* are polar coordinates, rather than
linear values along color axes.

The *`L`* (Lightness) component is the same as the CIE Lightness, and is
a *\<percentage\>* from `0%` representing black to `100%` representing
white.

The *`C`* (Chroma amount) component roughly represents the amount of
color. Its minimum value is `0`, and no maximum is defined. Negative `C`
values are clamped to 0.

The *`H`* (Hue angle) component is essentially a combination of the
*`a`* and *`b`* values in `lab()`. The value `0` points along the
positive a-axis (toward purplish red), `90` points along the positive
b-axis (toward mustard yellow), `180` points along the negative a-axis
(toward greenish cyan), and `270` points along the negative b-axis
(toward sky blue). This component loosely corresponds to HSL's Hue, but
the hue angles differ.

The optional *`A`* (alpha) component can be a \<*`number`*\> from 0 to
1, or else a \<*`percentage`*\>, where the number 1 corresponds to 100%
(full opacity). If present, it is preceded by a forward slash (`/`).
Here are some examples:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
lch(56% 132 331)
lch(52% 132 8)
lch(52% 132 8 / 50%)
```

To give an example of the capabilities of LCH, `lch(52% 132 8)` is a
very bright magenta equivalent to `rgb(118.23% -46.78% 40.48%)`. Notice
the large red value and the negative green value, which places the color
outside the sRGB color space. If you supplied that RGB value to a
browser, it would clamp the value to `rgb(100% 0% 40.48%)`. This is
within the sRGB color space, but it is visually quite distinct from the
color that is defined by `lch(52% 132 8)`.

set of visually similar colors and performing a numerical optimization
on them, yielding a color space with better hue linearity and
uniformity, and better chroma uniformity, than the CIE color spaces.
Oklch is a polar-coordinate version of Oklab, just as LCH is to Lab.

Because of this improved uniformity, Oklab and Oklch will be the default
for color-interpolation calculations in CSS going forward. However, as

The `color()` []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085655424

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085654688
primary="color values" secondary="color() function"
data-type="indexterm"}function value allows a color to be specified in a
named color space rather than the implicit sRGB color space. It accepts
four space-separated parameters, as well as an optional fifth opacity
value preceded by a forward slash (*/*).

The first parameter is a predefined, named color space. Possible values
as of late 2022 include `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `display-p3`, `a98-rgb`,
`prophoto-rgb`, `rec2020`, `xyz`, `xyz-d50`, and `xyz-d65`. The three
values that follow are specific to the color space declared in the first
parameter. Some color spaces may allow these values to be percentages,
while others may not.

As an example, the following values should yield the same color:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#7654CD
rgb(46.27% 32.94% 80.39%)
lab(44.36% 36.05 -58.99)
color(xyz-d50 0.2005 0.14089 0.4472)
color(xyz-d65 0.21661 0.14602 0.59452)
```

You could easily declare a color that lies outside the gamut of a given
color space. For example, `color(display-p3 -0.6112 1.0079 -0.2192);` is
outside the `display-p3` gamut. It's still a valid color, just not one
that can be expressed in that color space. When a color value is valid
but outside the gamut, it will be mapped to the closest color that lies
inside the color space's gamut.

If a color's value is straight-up invalid, opaque black is used.

primary="color values" secondary="applying color"
data-type="indexterm"}gone through all the possible color formats, let's
take a brief detour to talk about the property that uses color values
the most often: `color`. This property sets the color of an element's
text and the value of `currentcolor`.

```{=html}

```{=html}

```
This property accepts as a value any valid color type, such as `#FFCC00`
or `rgb(100% 80% 0% / 0.5)`.

For nonreplaced elements like paragraphs or `<em>` elements, `color`
sets the color of the text in the element. The following code results in
[Figure 5-14](#ch05.xhtml_cab_fig01){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="color: gray;">This paragraph has a gray foreground.</p>
<p>This paragraph has the default foreground.</p>
```

<h6 id="ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_309"><span class="label">Figure 5-14.
</span>Declared color versus default color</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this example, the default foreground color is black. That doesn't
have to be the case, since the user might have set their browser (or
other user agent) to use a different foreground (text) color. If the
browser's default text color was set to `green`, the second paragraph in
the preceding example would be green, not black---but the first
paragraph would still be gray.

You need not restrict yourself to such basic operations. There are
plenty of ways to use `color`. You might have some paragraphs that
contain text warning the user of a potential problem. To make this text
stand out more than usual, you might decide to color it red. Just apply
a class of `warn` to each paragraph that contains warning text
(`<p class="warn">`) and the following rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.warn {color: red;}
```

In the same document, you might decide that any unvisited hyperlinks
within a warning paragraph should be green:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.warn {color: red;}
p.warn a:link {color: green;}
```

Then you change your mind, deciding that warning text should be dark
red, and that unvisited links in such text should be medium purple. The
preceding rules need only be changed to reflect the new values. The
following code results in
[Figure 5-15](#ch05.xhtml_cab_fig02){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.warn {color: #600;}
p.warn a:link {color: #400040;}
```

Another use for `color` is to draw attention to certain types of text.
For example, boldfaced text is already fairly obvious, but you could
give it a different color to make it stand out even further---let's say,
maroon:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
b, strong {color: maroon;}
```

any of your text, you run the risk that a user's setup won't combine
well with your own. For example, if a user has set their browser's
background to be a pale yellow, like `#FFC`, then the previous rule
would generate light-yellow text on a pale-yellow background. Far more
likely is that it's still the default background of white, against which
light yellow is still going to be hard to read. It's therefore generally
a good idea to set foreground and background colors together. (We'll
talk about background colors shortly.)[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085307152

## Affecting Form Elements {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_311}

Setting a value for `color` should (in theory, anyway) apply to form
elements. Declaring `<select>` elements to have dark-gray text should be
as simple as this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
select {color: rgb(33%,33%,33%);}
```

This might also set the color of the borders around the edge of the
`<select>` element, or it might not. It all depends on the user agent
and its default styles.

elements---although, as you can see in
[Figure 5-16](#ch05.xhtml_cab_fig05){data-type="xref"}, doing so would
apply that color to all inputs, from text to radio buttons to checkbox
inputs:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
select {color: rgb(33%,33%,33%);}
input {color: red;}
```

</div>
</figure>

Note in [Figure 5-16](#ch05.xhtml_cab_fig05){data-type="xref"} that the
text color next to the checkboxes is still black. This is because the
rules shown assign styles only to elements like `<input>` and
`<select>`, not normal paragraph (or other) text.

Also note that the checkmark in the checkbox is black. This is due to
the way form elements are handled in some web browsers, which typically
use the form widgets built into the base operating system. Thus, when
you see a checkbox and checkmark, they really aren't content in the HTML
document---they're UI widgets that have been inserted into the document,
much as an image would be. In fact, form inputs are, [like
images,]{.keep-together} replaced elements. In theory, CSS does not
style the contents of form elements (though this may change in the
future).

In practice, the line is a lot blurrier than that, as
[Figure 5-16](#ch05.xhtml_cab_fig05){data-type="xref"} demonstrates.
Some form inputs have the color of their text and even portions of their
UI changed, while others do not. And since the rules aren't explicitly
defined, behavior is inconsistent across browsers. In short, form
elements are deeply tricky to style and should be approached with
extreme caution.

inherited. This makes sense, since if you declare `p {color: gray;}`,
you probably expect that any text within that paragraph will also be
gray, even if it's emphasized or boldfaced or whatever. If you *want*
such [elements]{.keep-together} to be different colors, that's easy
enough. The following code, for example, results in
[Figure 5-17](#ch05.xhtml_cab_fig06){data-type="xref"}:

Since color is inherited, it's theoretically possible to set all of the
ordinary text in a document to a color, such as red, by declaring
`body {color: red;}`. This should make all text that is not otherwise
styled (such as anchors, which have their own color styles)

talking about hue angles in a number of color value types, this is a
good time to talk about angle units. Angles in general are represented
as \<*`angle`*\>, which is a \<*`number`*\> followed by one of four unit
types:

`deg`

:   Degrees, []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085163312
    primary="deg (degrees) unit" data-type="indexterm"}of which there
    are 360 in a full circle.

    primary="grad (gradians) unit" data-type="indexterm"}of which there
    are 400 in a full circle. Also known as *grades* or *gons*.

`rad`

:   Radians, []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085157872
    primary="rad (radians) unit" data-type="indexterm"}of which there
    are 2π (approximately 6.28) in a full circle.

`turn`

:   Turns, []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797085155600 primary="turn unit"
    data-type="indexterm"}of which there is one in a full circle. This
    unit is mostly useful when animating a rotation and you wish to have
    it turn multiple times, such as `10turn` to make it spin 10 times.
    (Sadly, the pluralization `turns` is invalid, at least as of early
    2023, and will be ignored.)

To help understand the relationships among these angle types,
[Table 5-2](#ch05.xhtml_angle_equivalents){data-type="xref"} shows how
some angles are expressed in the various angle units. Unlike for length
values, when including angles, the unit is always required, even if the
value is `0deg`.

The first integer refers to the width (inline size) of an element, and
the second to the height (block size). Thus, to express a
height-to-width ratio of 16 to 9, you can write `16/9` or `16 / 9`.

As of late 2022, there is no facility to express a ratio as a single
real number (e.g., `1.777` instead of `16/9`), nor to use a colon

  [ left | center | right | <percentage> | <length> ]

  [ center | [ left | right ] [ <percentage> | <length> ]? ] &&
  [ center | [ top | bottom ] [ <percentage> | <length> ]? ]
]
```

That might seem a little nutty, but it's all down to the subtly complex
patterns that this value type has to allow.

If you declare only one value, such as `left` or `25%`, the second value
is set to `center`. Thus, `left` is the same as `left center`, and `25%`
is the same as `25% center`.

If you declare two values (either implicitly, as in the previous
example, or explicitly), and the first one is a \<*`length`*\> or
\<*`percentage`*\>, then it is *always* considered to be the horizontal
value. Therefore, given `25% 35px`, the `25%` is a horizontal distance
and the `35px` is a vertical distance. If you swap them to say
`35px 25%`, then `35px` is horizontal and `25%` is vertical. If you
write `25% left` or `35px right`, the entire value is invalid because
you have supplied two horizontal distances and no vertical distance.
(Similarly, a value of `right left` or `top bottom` is invalid and will
be ignored.) On the other hand, if you write `left 25%` or `right 35px`,
there is no problem because you've given a horizontal distance (with the
keyword) and a vertical distance (with the percentage or length).

If you declare four values (we'll deal with three in just a moment), you
must have two lengths or percentages, each of which is preceded by a
keyword. In this case, each length or percentage specifies an offset
distance, and each keyword defines the edge from which the offset is
calculated. Thus, `right 10px bottom 30px` means an offset of 10 pixels
to the left of the right edge, and an offset of 30 pixels up from the
bottom edge. Similarly, `top 50% left 35px` means a 50% offset from the
top and a 35-pixels-to-the-right offset from the left.

You []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797084981040
primary="background-position property" data-type="indexterm"}can declare
only three position values with the `background-position` property. If
you declare three values, the rules are the same as for four, except the
fourth offset is set to be 0 (no offset). Thus `right 20px top` is the
same as `right 20px top 0`.

like Less or Sass, you've probably created variables to hold values. CSS
itself has this capability as well. The technical term for this is
*custom properties*, even though what these really do is create
something like variables in your CSS.

Here's a basic example, with the result shown in
[Figure 5-18](#ch05.xhtml_val_css4_custom-values){data-type="xref"}
(though color won't be visible in the printed version):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html {
    --base-color: #639;
    --highlight-color: #AEA;
}

h1 {color: var(--base-color);}

<h6 id="ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_320"><span class="label">Figure 5-18.
</span>Using custom values to color headings</h6>
</div>
</figure>

There are two things to absorb here. The first is the definition of the
custom values [`--base-color`]{.keep-together} and `--highlight-color`.
These are not some sort of special color types. They're just names that
we picked to describe what the values contain. We could just as easily
have said this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html {
    --alison: #639;
    --david: #AEA;
}

h1 {color: var(--alison);}
h2 {color: var(--david);}
```

You probably shouldn't do that sort of thing, unless you're literally
defining colors that specifically correspond to people named Alison and
David. (Perhaps on an "About Our Team" page.) It's always better to
define custom identifiers that are self-documenting---things like
`main-color` or `accent-color` or `brand-font-face`.

The []{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797084875168
primary="-- (hyphens, double), in custom properties"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797084874464
primary="hyphens, double (--), in custom properties"
data-type="indexterm"}important point is that any custom identifier of
this type begins with *two* hyphens (`--`). It can then be invoked later
by using a `var()` value type. Note that these names are case-sensitive,
so `--main-color` and `--Main-color` are completely separate
identifiers.

These []{#ch05.xhtml_ix_var_func primary="var() function"
data-type="indexterm"}custom identifiers are often referred to as *CSS
variables*, which explains the `var()` pattern. An interesting feature
of custom properties is their ability to scope themselves to a given
portion of the DOM. If that sentence made any sense to you, it probably
gave a little thrill. If not, here's an example to illustrate scoping,
with the result shown in
[Figure 5-19](#ch05.xhtml_val_css4_custom-value-scoping){data-type="xref"}:

``` {.pagebreak-before code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

    --base-color: #666;
}

    --base-color: #CCC;

h1 {color: var(--base-color);}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<body>

<h1>Heading 1</h1><p>Main text.</p>

<aside>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1><p>An aside.</p>

</span>Scoping custom values to certain contexts</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the headings are a dark gray outside the `<aside>` element
and a light gray inside. That's because the variable `--base-color` was
updated for `<aside>` elements. The new custom value applies to any
`<h1>` inside an `<aside>` element.

A great many patterns are possible with CSS variables, even if they are
confined to value replacement. Here's an example suggested by Chriztian
Steinmeier combining variables with the `calc()` function to create a
regular set of indents for unordered lists:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
html {
    --gutter: 3ch;
    --offset: 1;
}
ul li {margin-left: calc(var(--gutter) * var(--offset));}
ul ul li {--offset: 2;}
ul ul ul li {--offset: 3;}
```

This particular example is basically the same as writing the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul li {margin-left: 3ch;}
ul ul li {margin-left: 6ch;}
ul ul ul li {margin-left: 9ch;}
```

The difference is that with variables, it's simple to update the
`--gutter` multiplier in one place and have everything adjust
automatically, rather than having to retype three values and make sure
all the math is correct.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Custom Property Fallbacks" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch05.xhtml_idm45797084578816 .sect2}
## Custom Property Fallbacks {#ch05.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_322}

When you're setting a value by using `var()`, you can specify a fallback
value. For example, you could say that if a custom property isn't
defined, you want a regular value used instead, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol li {margin-left: var(--list-indent, 2em);}
```

Given that, if `--list-indent` isn't defined, is determined to be
invalid, or is explicitly set to `initial`, `2em` will be used instead.
You get just the one fallback, and it can't be another custom property
name.

That said, it *can* be another `var()` expression, and that nested
`var()` can contain another `var()` as its fallback, and so on to
infinity. So let's say you're using a pattern library that defines
colors for various interface elements. If those aren't available for
some reason, you could fall back to a custom property value defined by
your basic site stylesheet. Then, if that's also not available, you
could fall back to a plain color value. It would look something like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.popup {color: var(--pattern-modal-color, var(--highlight-color, maroon));}
```

The thing to watch out for here is that if you manage to create an
invalid value, the whole thing gets blown up and the value is either
inherited or set to its initial value, depending on whether the property
in question is usually inherited or not, as if it were set to `unset`
(see ["unset"](#ch05.xhtml_unset){data-type="xref"}).

Suppose we wrote the following invalid `var()` values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:root {
	--list-color: hsl(23, 25%, 50%);
	--list-indent: 5vw;
}

li {
	color: var(--list-color, --base-color, gray);
	margin-left: var(--list-indent, --left-indent, 2em);
}
```

In the first case, the fallback is `--base-color, gray` as a single
string, not something that's parsed, so it's invalid. Similarly, in the
second case, the fallback `--left-indent` was never declared. In either
case, if the first custom property is valid, the invalid fallback
doesn't matter, because the browser never gets to it. But if, say,
`--list-indent` doesn't have a value, the browser will go to the
fallback, and here that's invalid. So what happens next?

For the color, since the property `color` is inherited, the list items
will inherit their color from their parent, almost certainly an `<ol>`
or `<ul>` element. If the parent's `color` value is `fuchsia`, the list
items will be fuchsia. For the left margin, the property `margin-left`
is not inherited, so the left margins of the list items will be set to
the initial value of `margin-left`, which is `0`. So the list items will
have no left margin.

This also happens if you try to apply a value to a property that can't
accept those kinds of values. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:root {
	--list-color: hsl(23, 25%, 50%);
	--list-indent: 5vw;
}

li {
	color: var(--list-indent, gray);
	margin-left: var(--list-color, 2em);
}
```

Here, everything looks fine at first glance, except the `color` property
is being given a length value, and the `margin-left` property is being
given a color value. As a result, the fallbacks of `gray` and `2em` are
not used. This is because the `var()` syntax is valid, so the result is
the same as if we declared `color: 5vw` and
`margin-left: hsl(23, 25%, 50%)`, both of which are tossed out as
invalid.

This means the outcome will be the same as we saw before: the list items
will inherit the color value from their parents, and their left margins
will be set to the initial value of 0, just as if the given values were
`unset`.[]{#ch05.xhtml_idm45797084317168 primary=""

As you've seen, CSS provides a wide range of value and unit types. These
units can have advantages and drawbacks, depending on the circumstances
in which they're used. You've already seen some of those circumstances,
and their nuances will be discussed throughout the rest of the book, as
appropriate.

You've []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_vis_format_ch6 primary="visual formatting"
data-type="indexterm"}likely experienced the frustration of having your
intended layout not render as expected. After adding 27 style rules to
get it perfect, you still might not know which rule solved your problem.
With a model as open and powerful as that contained within CSS, no book
could hope to cover every possible way of combining properties and
effects. You will undoubtedly go on to discover new ways of using CSS.
With a thorough grasp of how the visual rendering model works, however,
you'll be better able to determine whether a behavior is a correct (if
unexpected) consequence of the rendering engine CSS defines.

First, we'll quickly review the kinds of boxes we'll be discussing, as
well as some important terms that are needed to understand the
explanations to come:

Block flow direction

:   Also []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084290144 primary="visual formatting"
    secondary="block flow direction"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084289136
    primary="block direction (axis)" data-type="indexterm"}known as the
    *block axis*, this is the direction along which block-level element
    boxes are stacked. []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084287920
    primary="vertical writing direction" data-type="indexterm"}In many
    languages, including all European and European-derived languages,
    this direction is from top to bottom. In Chinese/Japanese/Korean
    (CJK) languages, this can be either right to left or top to bottom.
    The actual block flow direction is set by the writing mode, which is
    discussed in
    [Chapter 15](../Text/ch15.xhtml#text_properties){data-type="xref"}.

Inline base direction

:   Also []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084285008 primary="visual formatting"
    secondary="inline base direction"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084284000
    primary="inline base direction (axis)" data-type="indexterm"}known
    as the *inline axis*, this is the direction along which lines of
    text are written. In Romanic languages, among others, this is left
    to right. In languages such as Arabic or Hebrew, the inline base
    direction is right to left. In CJK languages, this can be either top
    to bottom or left to right. As with block flow, the inline base
    direction is set by the writing mode.

Normal flow

:   The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084281504 primary="visual formatting"
    secondary="normal flow"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084280496
    primary="normal flow" data-type="indexterm"}default system by which
    elements are placed inside the browser's viewport, based on the
    parent's writing mode. Most elements are in the normal flow, and the
    only way for an element to leave the normal flow is to be floated,
    positioned, or made into a flexible box, grid layout, or table
    element. The discussions in this chapter cover elements in the
    normal flow, unless otherwise stated.

Block box

:   This is a []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084278416 primary="blocks"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084277680
    primary="blocks" secondary="element boxes"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084276736
    primary="element boxes" secondary="blocks" data-type="indexterm"}box
    generated by an element such as a paragraph, heading, or `<div>`.
    These boxes generate blank spaces both before and after their boxes
    when in the normal flow so that block boxes in the normal flow stack
    along the block flow axis, one after another. Pretty much any
    element can be made to generate a block box by declaring
    `display: block`, though there are other ways to make elements
    generate block boxes (e.g., float them or make them flex items).

Inline box

:   This is a []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084273072 primary="inline boxes"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084272336
    primary="element boxes" secondary="inline boxes"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084271392
    primary="boxes" secondary="element boxes" tertiary="inline boxes"
    data-type="indexterm"}box generated by an element such as `<strong>`
    or `<span>`. These boxes are laid out along the inline base
    direction, and do not generate line breaks before or after
    themselves. An inline box longer than the inline size of its element
    will (by default, if it's nonreplaced) wrap to multiple lines. Any
    element can be made to generate an inline box by declaring
    `display: inline`.

Nonreplaced element

:   This is an []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084267584
    primary="nonreplaced elements"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084266848
    primary="positioning" secondary="nonreplaced elements"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084265904
    primary="absolute positioning" secondary="nonreplaced elements"
    data-type="indexterm"}element whose content is contained within the
    document. For example, a paragraph (`<p>`) is a nonreplaced element
    because its textual content is found within the element itself.

Replaced element

:   This is an []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084262704 primary="positioning"
    secondary="replaced elements"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084261728

    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084260080
    primary="absolute positioning" secondary="replaced elements"
    data-type="indexterm"}element that serves as a placeholder for
    something else. The classic example of a replaced element is
    `<img>`, which simply points to an image file that is inserted into
    the document's flow at the point where the `<img>` element itself is
    found. []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084257968 primary="form elements"
    secondary="as replaced elements"
    secondary-sortas="replaced elements" data-type="indexterm"}Most form
    elements are also replaced (e.g., `<input type="radio">`).

Root element

:   This is the []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084254768 primary="root elements"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084254064
    primary="elements" secondary="root" data-type="indexterm"}element at
    the top of the document tree. In HTML documents, this is the element
    `<html>`. In XML documents, it can be whatever the language permits:
    for example, the root element of RSS files is `<rss>`, whereas in an
    SVG document, the root element is
    `<svg>`.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084251552 primary=""

We need to []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084247632

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084246624

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084245008
primary="positioning" secondary="containing blocks and"
data-type="indexterm"}examine one more kind of box in detail, and in
this case enough detail that it merits its own section: the *containing
block*.

Every element's box is laid out with respect to its containing block. In
a very real way, the containing block is the *layout context* for a box.
CSS defines a series of rules for determining a box's containing block.

For a given element, the containing block
[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084242080 primary="content edge"
data-type="indexterm"}forms from the *content edge* of the nearest
ancestor element that generates a list item or block box, which includes
all table-related boxes (e.g., those generated by table cells). Consider
the following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<body>
    <div>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </div>
</body>
```

In this simple markup, the containing block for the `<p>` element's
block box is the `<div>` element's block box, as that is the closest
ancestor element box that has a block or a list item box (in this case,
it's a block box). Similarly, the `<div>`'s containing block is the
`<body>`'s box. Thus, the layout of the `<p>` is dependent on the layout
of the `<div>`, which is in turn dependent on the layout of the `<body>`
element.

And []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084213632 primary="initial containing block"
data-type="indexterm"}above that in the document tree, the layout of the
`<body>` element is dependent on the layout of the `<html>` element,
whose box creates what is called the *initial containing block*. It's
unique in that the viewport---the browser window in screen media, or the
printable area of the page in print media---determines the dimensions of
the initial containing block, not the size of the content of the root
element. This matters because the content can be shorter, and usually
longer, than the size of the viewport. Most of the time it doesn't make
a difference, but when it comes to things such as fixed positioning or
viewport units, the difference is real.

Now that you []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084210976
primary="visual formatting" secondary="outlines"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084209968
primary="visual formatting" secondary="borders"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084209024
primary="border-style property" data-type="indexterm"}understand some of
the terminology, we can address the properties that make up
[Figure 6-1](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig01){data-type="xref"}. The various
margin, border, and padding features, such as `border-style`, can be set
using various side-specific longhand properties, such as
`margin-inline-start` or `border-bottom-width`. (The outline properties
do not have side-specific properties; a change to an outline property
affects all four sides.)

The content's []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084205888 primary="backgrounds"
secondary="containing block" data-type="indexterm"}background---a color
or tiled image, for example---is applied within the padding and border
areas by default, but this can be changed. The margins are always
transparent, allowing the background(s) of any parent element(s) to be
visible. Padding and borders cannot be of a negative length, but margins
can. We'll explore the effects of negative margins in ["Negative Margins
and
Collapsing"](#ch06.xhtml_negative-margins-and-collapsing){data-type="xref"}.

Borders are []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084203296 primary="borders"
secondary="containing block" data-type="indexterm"}most often generated
using defined styles, with a `border-style` such as `solid`, `dotted`,
or `inset`, and their colors are set using the `border-color` property.
If no color is set, the value defaults to `currentcolor`. Borders can
also be generated from images. If a border style has gaps of some type,
as with `border-style: dashed` or with a border generated from a
partially transparent image, then the element's background is visible
through those gaps by default, though it is possible to clip the
background to stay inside the border (or the
padding).[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797084199008 primary=""

We're going to ignore the `ruby`- and `table`-related values, since
they're far too complex for this chapter. We'll also temporarily ignore
the value `list-item`, since it's very similar to block boxes and is
explored in detail in
[Chapter 16](../Text/ch16.xhtml#lists-and-generated-content){data-type="xref"}.
For now, we'll spend a moment talking about how altering an element's
display role can alter layout.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Changing Roles" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch06.xhtml_changing-roles .sect2}
## Changing Roles {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_330}

When it comes to styling a document, it's sometimes handy to be able to
change the type of box an element generates. For example, suppose we
have a series of links in a `<nav>` that we'd like to lay out as a
vertical sidebar:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<nav>
    <a href="index.xhtml">WidgetCo Home</a>
    <a href="products.xhtml">Products</a>
    <a href="services.xhtml">Services</a>
    <a href="fun.xhtml">Widgety Fun!</a>
    <a href="support.xhtml">Support</a>
    <a href="about.xhtml" id="current">About Us</a>
    <a href="contact.xhtml">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

By default, the links will generate inline boxes, and thus get sort of
mushed together into what looks like a short paragraph of nothing but
links. We could put all the links into their own paragraphs or list
items, or we could just make them all block-level elements, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav a {display: block;}
```

This will make every `<a>` element within the navigation element `<nav>`
generate a block box, instead of its usual inline box. If we add on a
few more styles, we could have a result like that shown in
[Figure 6-2](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig02){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig02" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0602.png" width="573" height="515"
alt="css5 0602" />
<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_331"><span class="label">Figure 6-2.
</span>Changing the display role from inline to block</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Changing display roles can be useful when you want the navigation links
to be inline elements if the CSS isn't available (perhaps by failing to
load), but to lay out the same links as block-level elements in
CSS-aware contexts. You could also present the links as inline on
desktop displays and block on mobile devices, or vice versa. With the
links laid out as blocks, you can style them as you would `<div>` or
`<p>` elements, with the advantage that the entire element box becomes
part of the link.

You may also want to take elements and make them inline. Suppose we have
an [unordered]{.keep-together} list of names:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ul id="rollcall">
    <li>Bob C.</li>
    <li>Marcio G.</li>
    <li>Eric M.</li>
    <li>Kat M.</li>
    <li>Tristan N.</li>
    <li>Arun R.</li>
    <li>Doron R.</li>
    <li>Susie W.</li>
</ul>
```

Given []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083956000 primary="list-item display"
data-type="indexterm"}this markup, say we want our display to show a
series of inline names with vertical bars between them (and on each end
of the list). The only way to do so is to change their display role. The
following rules will have the effect shown in
[Figure 6-3](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig03){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#rollcall li {display: inline; border-right: 1px solid; padding: 0 0.33em;}
#rollcall li:first-child {border-left: 1px solid;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig03" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0603.png" width="600" height="17"
alt="css5 0603" />
<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_332"><span class="label">Figure 6-3.
</span>Changing the display role from <code>list-item</code> to
<code>inline</code></h6>
</div>
</figure>

Understand that you are, for the most part, changing the display role of
elements---not changing their inherent nature. In other words, causing a
paragraph to generate an inline box does *not* turn that paragraph into
an inline element. In HTML, for example, some elements are block while
others are inline. While a `<span>` can easily be placed inside a
paragraph, a `<span>` should not be wrapped around a paragraph.

We say "for the most part" because while
[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083875904 primary="accessibility issues"
secondary="element display role changes" data-type="indexterm"}CSS
mostly impacts presentation and not content, CSS properties can impact
accessibility in more ways than just color contrast. For example,
changing the `display` value can impact the way an element is perceived
by assistive technologies. Setting an element's `display` property to
`none` removes the element from the accessibility tree. Setting the
`display` property on a `<table>` to `grid` may cause the table to be

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_write_mode_flow
primary="writing modes (flow direction)" data-type="indexterm"}CSS deals
with the block directions and inline directions, as well as block sizes
and inline sizes. Block and inline sizes are descriptions of the size of
the content area (by default) along the block and inline axes.

By contrast, the *width* (sometimes referred to as the *physical width*)
of a block box is defined as the distance between the inner edges of the
content area (again, by default) along the horizontal axis (left to
right), regardless of the writing direction, and the *height* (*physical
height*) is the distance along the vertical axis (top to bottom).
Properties are available to set all these sizes, which we'll talk about
shortly.

Something important to note in
[Figure 6-4](#ch06.xhtml_css5_07box){data-type="xref"} is the use of
*start* and *end* to describe various parts of the element box.
[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083816896 primary="logical properties"
secondary="margins" data-type="indexterm"}For example, you'll see a
block-start margin and a block-end margin. The *start edge* is the edge
that you come to first as you move along an axis.

This []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083814928 primary="boxes"

clearer if you look at
[Figure 6-5](#ch06.xhtml_css5_07block-inline-axes){data-type="xref"} and
trace your finger along each axis from arrow tail to tip. As you move
along a block axis, the first edge you come to for each element is that
element's block-start edge. As you pass out of the element, you move
through the block-end edges. Similarly, as you move along an inline
axis, you go through the inline-start edges, across the inline dimension
of the content, and then out the inline-end edges. Try it for each of
the three examples.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083812752 primary=""

These properties allow you to set the size of an element along its block
axis, or to constrain the lengths of lines of text along the inline
axis, regardless of the direction of text flow. If you write
`block-size: 500px`, the element's block size will be 500 pixels wide,
even if that leads to content spilling out of the element box. (We'll
discuss that in more detail later in the chapter.)

Consider the following, which has the results shown in
[Figure 6-6](#ch06.xhtml_sizing-elements-inline-axis){data-type="xref"}
when applied in various writing modes:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {inline-size: 25ch;}
```

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_338"><span class="label">Figure 6-6.
</span>Sizing elements along their inline axis</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As seen in
[Figure 6-6](#ch06.xhtml_sizing-elements-inline-axis){data-type="xref"},
the elements are sized consistently along their inline axis, regardless
of the writing direction. If you tilt your head to the side, you can see
that the lines wrap in exactly the same places. This yields a consistent
line length across all writing modes.

Similarly, you can set a block size for elements. This is used a bit
more often for replaced elements like images, but it can be used in any
circumstance that makes sense. Take this as an example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p img {block-size: 1.5em;}
```

Having done that, any `<img>` element found inside a `<p>` element will
have its block size set to one and a half times the size of the
surrounding text. (This works on images because they're inline replaced
elements; it wouldn't work on inline nonreplaced elements.) You could
also use `block-size` to constrain the block length of grid layout items
to be a minimum or maximum size, such as this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#maingrid > nav {block-size: clamp(2rem, 4em, 25vh);}
```

It should be said that usually block size is determined automatically,
because elements in the normal flow often don't have an explicitly set
block size. For example, if an element's block flow is top to bottom and
it's 8 lines long, and each line is 1/8th of an inch tall, then its
block size will be 1 inch. If it's 10 lines tall, the block size is
instead 1.25 inches. In either case, as long as `block-size` is `auto`,
the block size is determined by the content of the element, not by the
author. This is usually what you want, particularly for elements
containing text. When `block-size` is explicitly set and there isn't
enough content to fill the box, empty space will appear inside the box;
if there is more content than can fit, the content may overflow the box
or scrollbars may appear.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083659280 primary=""

setting block and inline sizes, a few keywords provide content-based

    data-type="indexterm"} up the most space possible to fit in the
    content, even suppressing line wrapping in the case of text content.

`min-content`

:   Take[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083667824 primary="min-content keyword"
    data-type="indexterm"} up the least space possible to fit in the
    content.

`fit-content`

:   Take[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083665328 primary="fit-content keyword"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083664592
    primary="flex-basis property" secondary="fit-content keyword"
    data-type="indexterm"} up the amount of space determined by
    calculating the values of `max-content`, `min-content`, and regular
    content sizing, taking the maximum of `min-content` and regular
    sizing, and then taking the minimum of `max-content` and whichever
    value was the greater of `min-content` and regular sizing. Yes, that
    all sounds a bit confusing, but we'll explain it in a moment.

If you've worked at all with CSS Grid (covered in
[Chapter 12](../Text/ch12.xhtml#grid-layout){data-type="xref"}), you may
recognize these keywords, as they were originally defined as ways to
size grid items. Now they're making their way into other areas of CSS.
Let's consider the first two keywords, which are
[demonstrated]{.keep-together} in
[Figure 6-7](#ch06.xhtml_content-sizing){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_content-sizing" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0607.png" width="600" height="231"
alt="css5 0607" />
<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_340"><span class="label">Figure 6-7.
</span>Content sizing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The paragraph on the left is set to `max-content`, and that's what
happens: the paragraph is made as wide as needed to fit all of the
content. It's as narrow as it is only because there isn't much content.
Had we added another three sentences, the single line of text would have
just kept going and going with no line wrapping, even if it ran right
off the page (or out of the browser window).

In the paragraph on the right, the content is as narrow as possible
without forcing breaks or hyphens inside words. In this particular case,
the element is *just* wide enough to fit the word "paragraph," which is
the longest word in the content. For every other line of text in the
example, the browser places as many words as will fit into the space
needed for "paragraph," and goes to the next line when it runs out of
room. If we added "antidisestablishmentarianism" to the text, the
element would become just wide enough to fit *that* word, and every
other line of text would very likely contain multiple words.

Notice that, at the end of the `min-content` example in
[Figure 6-7](#ch06.xhtml_content-sizing){data-type="xref"}, the browser
took advantage of the presence of the hyphen in `min-content` to trigger
a line wrap there. Had it not made that choice, `min-content` would
almost certainly have been the longest piece of content in the
paragraph, and the element's width would have been set to that length.
This means that if your content contains symbols that browsers
understand to be natural line-wrapping points (e.g., spaces and
hyphens), they'll likely be considered in the `min-content`
calculations. If you want to squeeze the element width even further, you
can enable auto-hyphenating of words with the `hyphens` property (see
[Chapter 15](../Text/ch15.xhtml#text_properties){data-type="xref"}).

For some more examples of `min-content` sizing, see
[Figure 6-8](#ch06.xhtml_minimum-content-sizing){data-type="xref"}.

The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083628000 primary="fit-content keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083627264
primary="flex-basis property" secondary="fit-content keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}third keyword, `fit-content`, is interesting in
that it does its best to fit the element to the content. What that means
in practice is that if you have only a little content, the element's
inline size (usually its width) will be just big enough to enclose it,
as if `max-content` were used. If there's enough content to wrap to
multiple lines or otherwise threaten to overflow the element's
container, the inline size stops there. This is illustrated in
[Figure 6-9](#ch06.xhtml_fit-content-sizing){data-type="xref"}.

In each case, the element is fit to the content without overspilling the
element's container. At least, that's what happens with elements in the
normal flow. The behavior can be quite different in flexbox and grid
contexts, and is further explored in later
chapters.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083622112 primary=""

```
These properties can be very useful when you know you want upper and
lower bounds on the sizing of an element's box, and are willing to allow
the browser to do whatever it wants as long as it obeys those
restrictions. As an example, you might set part of a layout like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {min-inline-size: min-content; max-inline-size: 75ch;}
```

That keeps the `<main>` element from getting any narrower than the
widest bit of inline content, whether that's a long word or an
illustration or something else. It also keeps the `<main>` element from
getting any wider than around 75 characters, thus keeping line lengths
to a readable amount.

It's also possible to set bounds on block sizing. A good example is
limiting any image embedded in the normal flow to be its intrinsic size
up to a certain point. The following CSS would have the effects shown in
[Figure 6-10](#ch06.xhtml_maximum-block-sizing){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

code, you're probably used to thinking of "top margin" and "bottom
margin." That's because, originally, all box model aspects were
described in terms of their physical directions: top, right, bottom, and
left. You can still work with the physical directions! CSS has simply
added new directions to the mix.

If you were to change `inline-size` to `width` in the previous code
example, you'd get a result more like that shown in
[Figure 6-11](#ch06.xhtml_sizing-elements-width){data-type="xref"} (in

The `height` and `width` properties are []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083464608
primary="physical properties" data-type="indexterm"}known as *physical
properties*. They refer to physical directions, as opposed to the
writing-dependent directions of block size and inline size. Thus,
`height` really does refer to the distance from the top to the bottom of
the element's inner edge, regardless of the direction of the block axis.

In writing with a horizontal inline axis, such as English or Arabic, if
both `inline-size` and `width` are set on the same element, the one
declared later will take precedence over the first one declared. The
same is true if `block-size` and `height` are both declared; if origin,
layer, and specificity are the same, the one declared last takes
precedence. In vertical writing modes, `inline-size` corresponds to
`height`, and `block-size` to `width`.

Setting a block box's height or width as a \<*`length`*\> means it will
be that length tall or wide, regardless of the content within it. If you
set an element that generates a block box to `width: 200px`, it will be
200 pixels wide, even if it has a 500-pixel-wide image inside it.

Setting the value of `width` to a \<*`percentage`*\> means the width of
the element will be that percentage of its containing block's width. If
you set a paragraph to `width: 50%` and its containing block is 1,024
pixels wide, then the paragraph's `width` will be computed to 512
pixels.

Setting `height` to a \<*`percentage`*\> works similarly, except this
works only if the containing block has an explicitly set height. If the
containing block's height is automatically set, a percentage value is
treated as `auto` instead, as seen in the `#cb4` example in
[Figure 6-12](#ch06.xhtml_heights-and-widths){data-type="xref"}.

###### Note {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_350}

The handling of `auto` top and bottom margins is different for
positioned elements, as well as flexible-box and grid elements. The
differences are covered in Chapters
[11](../Text/ch11.xhtml#flexbox){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"} and
[12](../Text/ch12.xhtml#grid-layout){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"}.
:::

Here are some examples of these values and combinations, with the result
shown in
[Figure 6-12](#ch06.xhtml_heights-and-widths){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

You can also use `max-content` and `min-content` with the `height`
property, but in top-to-bottom block flows, both are the same as
`height: auto`. In writing modes using a horizontal block axis, setting
these values for `height` will have similar effects as setting them for
`width` in vertical block flows.

In addition, these properties don't apply to inline nonreplaced
elements. For example, if you try to declare a `height` and `width` for
a hyperlink that's in the normal flow and generates an inline box,
CSS-conformant browsers *must* ignore those declarations. Assume the
following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:any-link {color: red; background: silver; height: 15px; width: 60px;}
```

You'll end up with red unvisited links on silver backgrounds whose
height and width are determined by the content of the links. The links
will *not* have content areas that are 15 pixels tall by 60 pixels wide,
as these must be ignored when applied to inline nonreplaced elements.
If, on the other hand, you add a `display` value, such as `inline-block`
or `block`, then `height` and `width` *will* set the height and width of
the links' content areas.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083279520 primary=""

This property changes what the values of the `height`, `width`,
`block-size`, and `inline-size` properties do.

If you declare `inline-size: 400px` and don't declare a value for
`box-sizing`, the element's content area will be 400 pixels in the
inline direction, and any padding, borders, and so on will be added to
that. If, on the other hand, you declare `box-sizing: border-box`, the
element box will be 400 pixels from the inline-start border edge to the
inline-end border edge; any inline-start or -end border or padding will
be placed within that distance, thus shrinking the inline size of the
content area. This is illustrated in
[Figure 6-13](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig05){data-type="xref"}.

Put []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_vis_format_border primary="visual formatting"
secondary="borders" data-type="indexterm"}another way, if you declare
`width: 400px` and don't declare a value for `box-sizing`, the element's
content area will be 400 pixels wide, and any padding, borders, and so
on will be added to that. If, on the other hand, you declare
`box-sizing: border-box`, the element box will be 400 pixels from the
left outer border edge to the right outer border edge; any left or right
border or padding will be placed within that distance, thus shrinking
the width of the content area (again, as seen in
[Figure 6-13](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig05){data-type="xref"}).

We're talking about the `box-sizing` property here because, as stated,
it applies to "all elements that accept `width` or `height` values"
(because it was defined before logical properties were commonplace).
That's most often elements generating block boxes, though it also
applies to replaced inline elements like images, as well as inline-block
boxes.

Having established how to size elements in both logical and physical
ways, let's widen our scope and look at all the properties that affect
block sizing.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083206912 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}total, block-axis formatting is affected by seven
related properties: `margin-block-start`, `border-block-start`,
`padding-block-start`, `height`, `padding-block-end`,
`border-block-end`, and `margin-block-end`. These properties are
diagrammed in [Figure 6-14](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig20){data-type="xref"}.
These properties are all covered in detail in
[Chapter 7](../Text/ch07.xhtml#padding-borders-outlines-and-margins){data-type="xref"};
here, we will talk about the general principles and behavior of these
properties before looking at the details of their values.

The block-start and -end padding and borders must be set to specific
values, or else they default to a width of 0, assuming no border style
is declared. If `border-style` has been set, the thickness of the
borders is set to `medium`, which is 3 pixels wide in all known
browsers. [Figure 6-14](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig20){data-type="xref"} depicts
the block-axis formatting properties in two writing modes and indicates
which parts of the box may have a value of `auto` and which may not.

</div>
</figure>

Interestingly, if either `margin-block-start` or `margin-block-end` is
set to `auto` for a block box in the normal flow, but not both, they
both evaluate to `0`. A value of `0`, unfortunately, prevents easy
block-direction centering of normal-flow boxes in their containing
blocks (though such centering is fairly straightforward in flexbox or
grid layout).

The `block-size` property[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083177952
primary="block-size property" data-type="indexterm"} must be set to
`auto` or to a nonnegative value of some type; it can never be less than
0.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083170688
primary="block-axis properties" secondary="auto block sizing"
data-type="indexterm"}simplest case, a normal-flow block box with
`block-size: auto` is rendered just tall enough to enclose the line
boxes of its inline content (including text). If an auto-block-size,
normal-flow block box has only block-level children and has no
block-edge padding or borders, the distance from its first child's
border-start edge to its last child's border-end edge will be the box's
block size. This is the case because the margins of the child elements
can "stick out" of the element that contains them thanks to what's known
as *margin collapsing*, which we'll talk about in ["Collapsing
Block-Axis
Margins"](#ch06.xhtml_collapsing-block-axis-margins){data-type="xref"}.

However, if a block-level element has either block-start or -end
padding, or block-start and -end borders, its block size will be the
distance from the block-start margin edge of its first child to the
block-end margin edge of its last child:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="block-size: auto; background: silver;">
    <p style="margin-block-start: 2em; margin-block-end: 2em;">A paragraph!</p>
</div>
<div style="block-size: auto; border-block-start: 1px solid;
     border-block-end: 1px solid; background: silver;">
    <p style="margin-block-start: 2em; margin-block-end: 2em;">
         Another paragraph!</p>
</div>
```

[Figure 6-15](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig23){data-type="xref"} demonstrates both
of these behaviors.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083111568 primary=""
startref="ix_vis_format_border" data-type="indexterm"}

If we changed the borders in the previous example to be padding instead,
the effect on the block size of the `<div>` would be the same: it would
still enclose the paragraph's margins within it.

primary="vertical formatting" secondary="percentage heights"
data-type="indexterm"}saw earlier how length-value block sizes are
handled, so let's spend a moment on percentages. If the block size of a
normal-flow block box is set to a percentage value, that value is taken
as a percentage of the block size of the box's containing block,
assuming the container has an explicit, non-`auto` block size of its
own. Given the following markup, the paragraph will be 3 em long along
the block axis:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="block-size: 6em;">
    <p style="block-size: 50%;">Half as tall</p>
</div>
```

If the block size of the containing block is *not* explicitly declared,
percentage block sizes are reset to `auto`. If we change the previous
example so that the `block-size` of the `<div>` is `auto`, the paragraph
will now have its block size determined automatically:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="block-size: auto;">
    <p style="block-size: 50%;">NOT half as tall; block size reset to auto</p>
</div>
```

[Figure 6-16](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig22){data-type="xref"} illustrates these
two possibilities. (The spaces between the paragraph borders and the
`<div>` borders are the block-start and -end margins on the paragraphs.)

Before we move on, take a closer look at the first example in
[Figure 6-16](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig22){data-type="xref"}, the half-as-tall
paragraph. It may be half as tall, but it isn't centered along the block
axis. That's because the containing `<div>` is 6 em tall, which means
the half-as-tall paragraph is 3 em tall. It has block-start and -end
margins of 1 em thanks to the browser's default styles, so its overall
block size is 5 em. That means there is actually 2 em of space between
the block end of the paragraph's visible box and the `<div>`'s block-end
border, not 1 em.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082992784 primary=""

The []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_vert_format_overflow primary="vertical formatting"
secondary="overflowing content, handling" data-type="indexterm"}default
value of `visible` means that the element's content may be visible
outside the element's box. Typically, this leads to the content running
outside its own element box, but not altering the shape of that box. The
following markup would result in
[Figure 6-18](#ch06.xhtml_overflow_methods){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#sidebar {block-size: 7em; background: #BBB; overflow: visible;}
```

If `overflow` is set to `hidden`, the element's content is clipped at
the edges of the element box. With the `hidden` value, there is no way
to get at the parts of the content that are clipped
off.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082941296 primary="hidden keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}

If `overflow` is set to `clip`, the element's content is also
clipped---that is, hidden---at the edges of the element box, with no way
to get at the parts that are clipped
off.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082938320 primary="boxes"

If `overflow` is set to `scroll`, the overflowing content is clipped,
but the content can be made available to the user via scrolling methods,
including a scrollbar (or set of them).
[Figure 6-18](#ch06.xhtml_overflow_methods){data-type="xref"} depicts
one possibility.

If `scroll` is used, the panning mechanisms (e.g., scrollbars) should
always be rendered. To quote the specification, "this avoids any problem
with scrollbars appearing or disappearing in a dynamic environment."
Thus, even if the element has sufficient space to display all its
content, the scrollbars may still appear and take up space (though they
may not).[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082933296 primary="scrolling"

In addition, when printing a page or otherwise displaying the document

`overflow` were declared to be

Finally, `overflow: auto` allows user agents to determine which of the
previously described behaviors to use, although user agents are
encouraged to provide a scrolling mechanism whenever necessary. This is
a potentially useful way to use overflow, since user agents could
interpret it to mean "provide scrollbars only when needed." (They may
not, but generally do.)

By []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082883504 primary="scrolling"
secondary="block box overflow" data-type="indexterm"}setting the
overflow behavior separately along each axis, you're essentially
deciding where scrollbars will appear and where they won't. Consider the
following, which is [rendered]{.keep-together} in
[Figure 6-19](#ch06.xhtml_overflow_x_y){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div.one   {overflow-x: scroll; overflow-y: hidden;}
div.two   {overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: scroll;}
div.three {overflow-x: scroll; overflow-y: scroll;}

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_367"><span class="label">Figure 6-19.
</span>Setting overflow separately for x- and y-axes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082846528 primary="horizontal formatting"
secondary="negative margins" data-type="indexterm"}first case, an empty
scrollbar is set up for the x-axis (horizontal), but none for the y-axis
(vertical), even though the content overflowed along the y-axis. This is
the worst of both worlds: a scrollbar that's empty because it isn't
needed, and no scrollbar where it is needed.

The second case is the much more useful inverse: no scrollbar is set
along the x-axis, but one is available for the y-axis, so the overflowed
content can be accessed by means of scrolling.

In the third case, `scroll` is set for both axes, so access to the
overflowing content is available via scrolling, but we also have an
unnecessary scrollbar (which is empty) for the x-axis. This is
equivalent to simply declaring `overflow: scroll`.

This brings us to the true nature of `overflow`: it's a shorthand
property that brings `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` together under one
roof. The following is exactly equivalent to the previous example and
will have the same result shown in
[Figure 6-19](#ch06.xhtml_overflow_x_y){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div.one   {overflow: scroll hidden;}
div.two   {overflow: hidden scroll;}
div.three {overflow: scroll;} /* 'scroll scroll' would also work */
```

As you see, you can give `overflow` two keywords, which are always in
the order *x*, then *y*. If only one value is given, it's used for both
the x- and y-axes. This is why `scroll` and `scroll scroll` are the same
thing as values of `overflow`. Similarly, `hidden` would be the same as
saying `hidden hidden`.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082781696 primary=""

secondary="negative margins and collapsing"

to move the margin edge inward toward the center of the element's box.
Consider this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.neg {margin-block-start: -50px; margin-block-end: 0;
    border: 3px solid gray;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

    <p class="neg">
        A paragraph.
    </p>
    A div.
</div>
```

As we see in [Figure 6-20](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig28){data-type="xref"}, the
paragraph has been pulled upward by its negative block-start margin.
Note that the content of the `<div>` that follows the paragraph in the
markup has also been pulled up the block axis by 50 pixels.

What's happening? The elements following the `<div>` are placed
according to the location of the block-end margin edge of the `<div>`,
which is 50 pixels higher than it would be without the negative margin.
As [Figure 6-21](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig29){data-type="xref"} shows, the
block-end of the `<div>` is actually *above* the visual block-end of its
child paragraph. The next element after the `<div>` is the appropriate
distance from the block-end of the `<div>`.

secondary="collapsing margins"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_block_axis_margin
primary="block-axis properties"
secondary="collapsing block-axis margins"
data-type="indexterm"}important aspect of block-axis formatting is the
*collapsing* of adjacent margins, which is a way of comparing adjacent
margins in the block direction, and then using only the largest of those
margins to set the distance between the adjacent block elements. Note
that []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082522928 primary="padding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082522256
primary="visual formatting" secondary="borders"
data-type="indexterm"}collapsing behavior applies only to margins.
Padding and borders never collapse.

An unordered list, with list items that follow one another along the
block axis, is a perfect environment for studying margin collapsing.
Assume that the following is declared for a list that contains three
items:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li {margin-block-start: 10px; margin-block-end: 15px;}
```

Each list item has a 10-pixel block-start margin and a 15-pixel
block-end margin. When the list is rendered, however, the visible
distance between adjacent list items is 15 pixels, not 25. This happens
because, along the block axis, adjacent margins are collapsed. In other
words, the smaller of the two margins is eliminated in favor of the
larger. [Figure 6-22](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig24){data-type="xref"} shows the
difference between collapsed and uncollapsed margins.

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig24" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0622.png" width="600" height="412"
alt="css5 0622" />
<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_372"><span class="label">Figure 6-22.
</span>Collapsed versus uncollapsed margins</h6>
</div>
</figure>

User agents will collapse block-adjacent margins as shown in the first
list in [Figure 6-22](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig24){data-type="xref"}, so that
15-pixel spaces appear between each list item. The second list shows
what happens if browsers don't collapse margins, resulting in 25-pixel
spaces between list items.

Another word to use, if you don't like "collapse," is "overlap."
Although the margins are not really overlapping, you can visualize
what's happening by using the following analogy.

Imagine that each element, such as a paragraph, is a small piece of
paper with the content of the element written on it. Around each piece
of paper is a certain amount of clear plastic, which represents the
margins. The first piece of paper (say an `<h1>` piece) is laid down on
the canvas. The second (a paragraph) is laid below it along the block
axis and then slid upward along that axis until the edge of one piece's
plastic touches the edge of the other's paper. If the first piece of
paper has half an inch of plastic along its block-end edge, and the
second has a third of an inch along its block-start, then when they
slide together, the first piece's block-end plastic will touch the
block-start edge of the second piece of paper. The two are now done
being placed on the canvas, and the plastic attached to the pieces is
overlapping.

Collapsing also occurs where multiple margins meet, such as at the end
of a list. Adding to the earlier example, let's assume the following
rules apply:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {margin-block-end: 15px;}
li {margin-block-start: 10px; margin-block-end: 20px;}
h1 {margin-block-start: 28px;}
```

The last item in the list has a block-end margin of 20 pixels, the
block-end margin of the `<ul>` is 15 pixels, and the block-start margin
of a succeeding `<h1>` is 28 pixels. So once the margins have been
collapsed, the distance between the end of the last `<li>` in the list
and the beginning of the `<h1>` is 28 pixels, as shown in
[Figure 6-23](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig25){data-type="xref"}.

If you add a []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082398944 primary="padding"
data-type="indexterm"} []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082398208

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082396448
primary="containing blocks" secondary="collapsing margins"
data-type="indexterm"}border or padding to a containing block, this
causes the margins of its child elements to be entirely contained within
it. We can see this behavior in operation by adding a border to the
`<ul>` element in the previous example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {margin-block-end: 15px; border: 1px solid;}
li {margin-block-start: 10px; margin-block-end: 20px;}
h1 {margin-block-start: 28px;}
```

With this change, the block-end margin of the `<li>` element is now
placed inside its parent element (the `<ul>`). Therefore, the only
margin collapsing that takes place is between the `<ul>` and the `<h1>`,
as illustrated in
[Figure 6-24](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig26){data-type="xref"}.

Negative []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_neg_margin primary="negative margins"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_margin_neg primary="margins"
secondary="negative" data-type="indexterm"}margin collapsing is slightly
different. When a negative margin participates in margin collapsing, the
browser takes the absolute value of the negative margin and subtracts it
from any adjacent positive margins. In other words, the negative length
is added to the positive length(s), and the resulting value is the
distance between the elements, even if that distance is a negative
length. [Figure 6-25](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig27){data-type="xref"} provides
some concrete examples.

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig27" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0625.png" width="511" height="344"

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_375"><span class="label">Figure 6-25.
</span>Examples of negative block-axis margins</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now let's consider an example where the margins of a list item, an
unordered list, and a paragraph are all collapsed. In this case, the
unordered list and paragraph are assigned negative margins:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li {margin-block-end: 20px;}
ul {margin-block-end: -15px;}
h1 {margin-block-start: -18px;}
```

The negative margin of the greatest magnitude (`-18px`) is added to the
largest positive margin (`20px`), yielding `20px` -- `18px` = `2px`.
Thus, we have only 2 pixels between the block-end of the list item's
content and the block-start of the `<h1>`'s content, as we can see in
[Figure 6-26](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig30){data-type="xref"}.

When elements overlap each other because of negative margins, it's hard
to tell which elements are on top of others. You may also have noticed
that very few of the examples in this section use background colors. If
they did, the background color of a following element might overwrite
the content of a preceding element. This is expected behavior, since
browsers usually render elements in order from beginning to end, so a
normal-flow element that comes later in the document can generally be
expected to overwrite an earlier element, assuming the two end up
overlapping.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082251968 primary=""

primary="visual formatting" secondary="inline-axis formatting"
data-type="indexterm"}elements along the inline axis can be more complex
than you'd think. Part of the complexity has to do with the default
behavior of `box-sizing`. With the default value of `content-box`, the
value given for `inline-size` affects the inline width of the content
area, *not* the entire visible element box. Consider the following
example, where the inline axis runs left to right:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="inline-size: 200px;">wideness?</p>
```

This []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_pad_addit_subtract primary="padding"
secondary="additive versus subtractive"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_addit_subtract_pad
primary="additive versus subtractive padding"
data-type="indexterm"}makes the paragraph's content area 200 pixels
wide. If we give the element a background, this will be quite obvious.
However, any padding, borders, or margins you specify are *added* to the
width value. Suppose we do this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="inline-size: 200px; padding: 10px; margin: 20px;">wideness?</p>
```

The visible element box is now 220 pixels in inline size, since we've
added 10 pixels of padding to every side of the content. The margins
will now extend another 20 pixels to both inline sides for an overall
element inline size of 260 pixels. This is illustrated in
[Figure 6-27](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig06){data-type="xref"}.

If we change the styles to use `box-sizing: border-box`, the results
will be different. In that case, the visible box will be 200 pixels wide
along the inline axis with a content inline size of 180 pixels, and a
total of 40 pixels of margin on the inline sides, giving an overall box
inline size of 240 pixels, as illustrated in
[Figure 6-28](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig07){data-type="xref"}.

In either case, the CSS specification has a rule that says the sum of
the inline components of a block box in the normal flow always equals
the inline size of the containing block (which is why, as you'll see in
just a bit, `margin: auto` centers content in the inline direction).
Let's consider two paragraphs within a `<div>` whose margins have been
set to `1em`, and whose `box-sizing` value is the default `content-box`.
The content size (the value of `inline-size`) of each paragraph in this
example, plus its inline-start and -end padding, borders, and margins,
will always add up to the inline size of the `<div>`'s content area.

Let's say the inline size of the `<div>` is `30em`. That makes the sum
total of the content size, padding, borders, and margins of each
paragraph 30 em. In
[Figure 6-29](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig08){data-type="xref"}, the "blank"
space around the paragraphs is actually their
margins.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082160864 primary=""

inline formatting---`margin-inline-start`, `border-inline-start`,

`padding-inline-end`, and `padding-inline-end`---are diagrammed in
[Figure 6-30](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig09){data-type="xref"}.

The values of these seven properties must add up to the inline size of
the element's containing block, which is usually the value of
`inline-size` for a block element's parent (since block-level elements
nearly always have block-level elements for parents).

Of these seven properties, only three may be set to `auto`: the inline
size of the element's content, and the inline-start and -end margins.
The remaining properties must either be set to specific values or
default to a width of 0.
[Figure 6-30](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig09){data-type="xref"} shows which parts
of the box can take a value of `auto` and which cannot. (That said, CSS
is forgiving: if any part that can't accept `auto` is erroneously set to
`auto`, it will default to `0`.)

The `inline-size` property must either be set to `auto` or a nonnegative
value. When you do use `auto` in inline-axis formatting, different
effects can occur.

## Using auto {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_383}

In []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inlineaxis_format_auto
primary="inline-axis formatting" secondary="auto, using"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_horiz_format_auto
primary="horizontal formatting" secondary="auto settings for"
data-type="indexterm"}certain situations, it makes a lot of sense to
explicitly set one or more of the inline margins and size to `auto`. By
default, the two inline margins are set to `0`, and the inline size is
set to `auto`. Let's explore how moving the `auto` around can have
different effects, and why.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Only one auto" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch06.xhtml_only_one_auto .sect3}
### Only one auto {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_384}

If you set one of `inline-size`, `margin-inline-start`, or
`margin-inline-end` to a value of `auto`, and give the other two
properties specific values, then the property that is set to `auto` is
set to the length required to make the element box's overall inline size
equal to the parent element's content inline size.

Let's say the sum of the seven inline-axis properties must equal 500
pixels, no padding or borders are set, the inline-end margin and inline
size are set to `100px`, and the inline-start margin is set to `auto`.
The inline-start margin will thus be 300 pixels wide:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px;}
p {margin-inline-start: auto; margin-inline-end: 100px;
    inline-size: 100px;} /* inline-start margin evaluates to 300px */
```

In a sense, `auto` can be used to make up the difference between
everything else and the required total. However, what if all three of
these properties (both inline margins and the inline size) are set to
`100px` and *none* of them are set to `auto`?

If all []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082086320 primary="overconstraining"
secondary="formatting properties" data-type="indexterm"}three properties
are set to something other than `auto`---or, in CSS parlance, when these
formatting properties have been *overconstrained*---then the margin at
the inline end is *always* forced to be `auto`. This means that if both
inline margins and the inline size are set to `100px`, the user agent
will reset the inline-end margin to `auto`. The inline-end margin's
width will then be set according to the rule that one `auto` value
"fills in" the distance needed to make the element's overall inline size
equal to that of its containing block's content inline size.
[Figure 6-31](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig11){data-type="xref"} shows the result
of the following markup in left-to-right languages like English:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px;}
p {margin-inline-start: 100px; margin-inline-end: 100px;
    inline-size: 100px;} /* inline-end margin forced to be 300px */

If both side margins are set explicitly, and `inline-size` is set to
`auto`, then `inline-size` will be whatever value is needed to reach the
required total (which is the content inline size of the parent element).
The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797082016032

This type of formatting is the most common, since it is equivalent to
setting the margins and not declaring anything for the `inline-size`.
The result of the following markup is exactly the same as that shown in

You []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081911008 primary="box-sizing property"
data-type="indexterm"}might be wondering what happens if `box-sizing` is
set to `padding-box`. In that case, all the same principles described
here apply, which is why this section discussed only `inline-size` and
the inline-side margins without introducing any padding or borders.

In other words, the handling of `inline-size: auto` in this section and
the following sections is the same regardless of the value of
`box-sizing`. The details of what gets placed where inside the
`box-sizing`-defined box may vary, but the treatment of `auto` values
does not, because `box-sizing` determines what `inline-size` refers to,
not how it behaves in relation to the margins.

::: {#ch06.xhtml_more-than-one-auto .sect3}
### More than one auto {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_387}

Now let's see what happens when two of the three properties
(`inline-size`, `margin-inline-start`, and `margin-inline-end`) are set
to `auto`. If both margins are set to `auto` but the `inline-size` is
set to a specific length, then both margins are set to equal lengths,
thus centering the element within its parent along the inline axis. The
following code creates this layout, illustrated in
[Figure 6-33](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig13){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px;}
p {inline-size: 300px; margin-inline-start: auto; margin-inline-end: auto;}
  /* each margin is 100 pixels, because (500-300)/2 = 100 */
```

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_388"><span class="label">Figure 6-33.
</span>Setting an explicit inline size</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Another way of sizing elements along the inline axis is to set one of
the inline margins and `inline-size` to `auto`. In this case, the margin
set to `auto` is reduced to 0:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px;}
p {margin-inline-start: auto; margin-inline-end: 100px; inline-size: auto;}
  /* inline-start margin evaluates to 0; inline-size becomes 400px  */
```

The `inline-size` property is then set to the value necessary to make
the element fill its containing block; in the preceding example, it
would be 400 pixels, as shown in
[Figure 6-34](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig14){data-type="xref"}.

### Too many autos {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_390}

Finally, what happens when all three properties are set to `auto`? The
answer: both margins are set to 0, and the `inline-size` is made as wide
as possible. This result is the same as the default situation, when no
values are explicitly declared for margins or the inline size. In such a
case, the margins default to 0 and `inline-size` defaults to `auto`.

Note that since inline margins do not collapse (unlike block margins, as
discussed earlier), the padding, borders, and margins of a parent
element can affect the inline layout of its children. The effect is
indirect in that the margins (and so on) of an element can induce an
offset for child elements.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081764624 primary=""

## Negative Margins {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_392}

As you've []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_neg_margin2 primary="negative margins"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_horiz_format_neg_margin
primary="horizontal formatting" secondary="negative margins"
data-type="indexterm"}seen with block-axis margins, it's possible to set
negative values for inline-axis margins. Setting negative inline margins
can result in some interesting effects.

Remember that the total of the seven inline-axis properties always
equals the inline size of the content area of the parent element. As
long as all inline properties are 0 or greater, an element's inline size
can never be greater than its parent's content area inline size.
However, consider the following markup, depicted in
[Figure 6-36](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig16){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px; border: 3px solid black;}
p.wide {margin-inline-start: 10px; margin-inline-end: -50px;
    inline-size: auto;}
```

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_393"><span class="label">Figure 6-36.
</span>Wider children through negative margins</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Yes indeed, the child element is wider than its parent along the inline
axis! This is mathematically correct. Let's solve for inline size:

-   10 px + 0 + 0 + 540 px + 0 + 0 -- 50 px = 500 px

The `540px` is the evaluation of `inline-size: auto`, which is the
number needed to balance out the rest of the values in the equation.
Even though it leads to a child element sticking out of its parent, it
all works because the values of the seven properties add up to the
required total.

Now, let's add some borders to the mix:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px; border: 3px solid black;}
p.wide {margin-inline-start: 10px; margin-inline-end: -50px;
    inline-size: auto; border: 3px solid gray;}
```

The resulting change will be a reduction in the evaluated width of
`inline-size`:

-   10 px + 3 px + 0 + 534 px + 0 + 3 px -- 50 px = 500 px

Or, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the content size instead
of for the width of the parent:

-   500 px -- 10 px -- 3 px -- 3 px + 50 px = 534 px

If we were to introduce padding, the value of `inline-size` would drop
even more (assuming `box-sizing: content-box`).

Conversely, it's possible to have `auto` inline-end margins evaluate to
negative amounts. If the values of other properties force the inline-end
margin to be negative in order to satisfy the requirement that elements
be no wider than their containing block, that's what will happen.
Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px; border: 3px solid black;}
p.wide {margin-inline-start: 10px; margin-inline-end: auto;
    inline-size: 600px; border: 3px solid gray;}
```

The equation works out like this:

-   500 px -- 10 px -- 600 px -- 3 px -- 3 px = --116 px

In this case, the inline-end margin evaluates to `-116px`. No matter
what explicit value it's given in the CSS, this margin will still be
forced to `-116px` because of the rule stating that when an element's
dimensions are overconstrained, the inline-end margin is reset to
whatever is needed to make the numbers work out correctly.

Let's consider another example, illustrated in
[Figure 6-37](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig17){data-type="xref"}, in which the
inline-start margin is set to be negative:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {inline-size: 500px; border: 3px solid black;}
p.wide {margin-inline-start: -50px; margin-inline-end: 10px;
    inline-size: auto; border: 3px solid gray;}
```

When it []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081398848 primary="horizontal formatting"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081397840
primary="inline-axis formatting" secondary="percentages"
data-type="indexterm"}comes to percentage values for the inline size,
padding, and margins, the same basic rules we discussed in previous
sections apply. It doesn't really matter whether the values are declared
with lengths or percentages.

Percentages can be very useful. Suppose we want an element's content to
be two-thirds the inline size of its containing block, the padding sides
to be 5% each, the inline-start margin to be 5%, and the inline-end
margin to take up the slack. That would be written something like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="inline-size: 67%;
     padding-inline-end: 5%; padding-inline-start: 5%;
     margin-inline-end: auto; margin-inline-start: 5%;">
     playing percentages</p>
```

The inline-end []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081340192
primary="margin-inline-end property" data-type="indexterm"}margin would
evaluate to 18% (100% -- 67% -- 5% -- 5% -- 5%) of the width of the
containing block.

Mixing percentages and length units can be tricky, however. Consider the
following example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="inline-size: 67%; padding-inline-end: 2em; padding-inline-start: 2em;
     margin-inline-end: auto; margin-inline-start: 5em;">mixed lengths</p>
```

In this case, the element's box can be defined like this:

-   5 em + 0 + 2 em + 67% + 2 em + 0 + auto = containing block width

In order for the inline-end margin's inline size to evaluate to 0, the
element's containing block must be 27.272727 em wide (with the content
area of the element being 18.272727 em wide) along the inline axis. Any
wider than that, and the inline-end margin will evaluate to a positive
value. Any narrower, and the inline-end margin will be a negative value.

The situation gets even more complicated if we start mixing length-value
unity types, like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="inline-size: 67%;
     padding-inline-end: 15px; padding-inline-start: 10px;
     margin-inline-end: auto; margin-inline-start: 5em;">more mixed lengths</p>
```

And, just to make things more complex, []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081291344
primary="borders" secondary="lack of percentage values for"
data-type="indexterm"}borders cannot accept percentage values, only
length values. The bottom line is that it isn't really possible to
create a fully flexible element based solely on percentages unless
you're willing to avoid using borders or use approaches such as flexible
box layout. That said, if you do need to mix percentages and length
units, using the `calc()` and `minmax()` value functions can be a life
changer, or at least a layout changer.

primary="inline-size property" data-type="indexterm"}been dealing with
the inline-axis formatting of nonreplaced block boxes in the normal flow
of text. Replaced elements are a bit simpler to manage. All of the rules
given for nonreplaced blocks hold true, with one exception: if
`inline-size` is `auto`, the `inline-size` of the element is the
content's intrinsic width. (*Intrinsic* means the original size---the
size of the element by default when no external factors are applied to
it.) The image in the following example will be 20 pixels wide because
that's the width of the original image:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<img src="smile.svg" style="display: block; inline-size: auto; margin: 0;"
   alt="smile">
```

If the actual image were 100 pixels wide instead, the element (and thus
the image) would be laid out as 100 pixels wide.

We can override this rule by assigning a specific value to
`inline-size`. Suppose we modify the previous example to show the same
image three times, each with a different width value:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<img src="smile.svg" style="display: block; inline-size: 25px; margin: 0;"

Note that the []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081166112
primary="block-size property" data-type="indexterm"}block size of the
elements also increases. When a replaced element's `inline-size` is
changed from its intrinsic width, the value of `block-size` is scaled to
match, maintaining the object's initial aspect ratio, unless
`block-size` has been set to an explicit value of its own. The reverse
is also true: if `block-size` is set, but `inline-size` is left as
`auto`, then the inline size is scaled proportionately to the change in
block size.

primary="inline-axis formatting" secondary="list items"

are typically preceded by a marker, such as a round bullet mark or a
number.

The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081157392
primary="list-style-position property" data-type="indexterm"}marker
attached to a list item element can be either outside the content of the
list item or treated as an inline marker at the beginning of the
content, depending on the value of the property `list-style-position`,
as illustrated in
[Figure 6-39](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig32){data-type="xref"}.

If the marker stays outside the content, it is placed a specified
distance from the inline-start content edge of the content. No matter
how the list's styles are altered, the marker stays the same distance
from the content edge.

Remember that list-item boxes define containing blocks for their
descendant boxes, just like regular block boxes.

to force elements to be square while still letting their sizes flex. In
these cases, the `aspect-ratio` property can help.

Let's say we know we'll have a bunch of elements, and we don't know how
wide or tall each will be, but we want them all to be squares. First,
pick an axis you want to size on. We'll use `height` here. Make sure the
other axis is autosized, and set an aspect ratio:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery div {width: auto; aspect-ratio: 1/1;}
```

[Figure 6-40](#ch06.xhtml_aspect-ratio){data-type="xref"} shows the same
set of HTML, both with and without the previous CSS applied.

The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081064336 primary="box-sizing property"
data-type="indexterm"}ratio is maintained over the distances defined by
`box-sizing` (see ["Altering Box
Sizing"](#ch06.xhtml_altering-box-sizing){data-type="xref"}), so given
the following CSS, the result will be an element whose outer border
distances are in an exact 2:1 ratio:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.cards div {height: auto; box-sizing: border-box; aspect-ratio: 2/1;}
```

The default value, `auto`, means that boxes that have an intrinsic
aspect ratio---boxes generated by images, for example---will use that
aspect ratio. For elements that don't have an intrinsic aspect ratio,
such as most HTML elements like `<div>`, `<p>`, and so on, the axis
sizes of the box will be determined by the
content.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797081016832 primary=""

# Inline Formatting {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_404}

*Inline formatting* isn't as simple as
[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_vis_format_inline primary="visual formatting"
secondary="inline formatting"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_ch6
primary="inline formatting" data-type="indexterm"}formatting block-level
elements, which just generates block boxes and usually doesn't allow
anything to coexist with them. By contrast, look *inside* a block-level
element, such as a paragraph. You may well ask, how was the size and
wrapping of each line determined? What controls the lines' arrangement?
How can I affect it?

## Line Layout {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_405}

To understand how []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_line_layout primary="line layout"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_line
primary="inline formatting" secondary="line layout"
data-type="indexterm"}lines are generated, first consider an element
containing one very long line of text, as shown in
[Figure 6-41](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig33){data-type="xref"}. Note that we've
put a border around the line by wrapping the entire line in a `<span>`
element and then assigning it a border style:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
span {border: 1px dashed black;}
```

</figure>

[Figure 6-41](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig33){data-type="xref"} shows the
simplest case of an inline element contained by a block-level
[element.]{.keep-together}

To get from this simplified state to something more familiar, all we
have to do is determine how wide (along the inline axis) the element
should be, and then break up the line so that the resulting pieces will
fit into the content inline size of the element. Therefore, we arrive at
the state shown in
[Figure 6-42](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig34){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig34" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_407"><span class="label">Figure 6-42.
</span>A multiple-line inline element</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Nothing has really changed. All we did was take the single line and
break it into pieces, and then stack those pieces one after the other
along the direction of the block flow.

In [Figure 6-42](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig34){data-type="xref"}, the borders
for each line of text also happen to coincide with the top and bottom of
each line. This is true only because no padding has been set for the
inline text. Notice that the borders overlap each other slightly; for
example, the bottom border of the first line is just below the top
border of the second line. This is because the border is drawn on the
next pixel to the *outside* of each line. Since the lines are touching
each other, their borders overlap as shown in
[Figure 6-42](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig34){data-type="xref"}.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_408}

For simplicity, we use terms such as *top* and *bottom* when talking
about the edges of line boxes. In this context, the top of a line box is
the one closest to the block-start, and the bottom of a line box is the
one closest to the block-end. Similarly, *tall* and *short* refer to the
size of line boxes along the block axis.
:::

If we alter the span styles to have a []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080946304
primary="inline formatting" secondary="background"
data-type="indexterm"}background color, the actual placement of the
lines becomes clearer. Consider
[Figure 6-43](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig35){data-type="xref"}, which shows four
paragraphs in each of two writing modes, and the effects of different
values of `text-align` (see
[Chapter 15](../Text/ch15.xhtml#text_properties){data-type="xref"}), by
each paragraph having the backgrounds of its lines [filled
in.]{.keep-together}

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig35" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_409"><span class="label">Figure 6-43.
</span>Showing lines in different alignments and writing modes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As [Figure 6-43](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig35){data-type="xref"} shows, not
every line reaches to the edge of its parent paragraph's content area,
which has been denoted with a dashed gray border. For the left-aligned
paragraph, the lines are all pushed flush against the left content edge
of the paragraph, and the end of each line happens wherever the line is
broken. The reverse is true for the right-aligned paragraph. For the
centered paragraph, the centers of the lines are aligned with the center
of the paragraph.

In the last []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080938816 primary="spacing"
seealso="whitespace" data-type="indexterm"}case, where the value of
`text-align` is `justify`, each line (except the last) is forced to be
as wide as the paragraph's content area so that the line's edges touch
the content edges of the paragraph. The difference between the natural
length of the line and the width of the paragraph's content area is made
up by altering the spacing between letters and words in each line.
Therefore, the value of `word-spacing` can be overridden when the text
is justified. (The value of `letter-spacing` cannot be overridden if it
is a length value.)

That pretty well covers how lines are generated in the simplest cases.
As you're about to see, however, the inline formatting model is far from
simple.

## Basic Terms and Concepts {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_410}

Before we go any further, let's []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_terms
primary="inline formatting" secondary="terms and concepts"
data-type="indexterm"}review some terms of inline layout, which will be
crucial in navigating the following sections:

Anonymous text

:   Any []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080930176 primary="anonymous text"
    data-type="indexterm"}string of characters that is not contained
    within an inline element. Thus, in the markup
    `<p> I'm <em>so</em> happy!</p>`, the sequences " I'm " and "
    happy!" are anonymous text. Note that the spaces are part of the
    text, since a space is a character like any other.

Em box

:   This is []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080927536 primary="boxes"
    secondary="em box (em square)"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080926528
    primary="character box (em box)"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080925856
    primary="em box (em square)"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080925184
    primary="fonts" secondary="glyphs not matching em boxes"
    data-type="indexterm"}defined in the given font, otherwise known as
    the character box. Actual glyphs can be taller or shorter than their
    em boxes. In CSS, the value of `font-size` determines the height of
    each em box.

Content area

:   In []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080922448 primary="content area"
    secondary="inline-level elements" data-type="indexterm"}nonreplaced
    elements, the content area can be one of two things, and the CSS
    specification allows user agents to choose which one. The content
    area can be the box described by the em boxes of every character in
    the element, strung together; or it can be the box described by the
    character glyphs in the element. In this book, we use the em box
    definition for simplicity, and that's what is used by most browsers.
    In replaced elements, the content area is the intrinsic height of
    the element plus any margins, borders, or padding.

Leading

:   Leading []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080919680 primary="leading"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_font_size_prop
    primary="font-size property" secondary="inline element height from"
    data-type="indexterm"}(pronounced "led-ing") is the difference
    between the values of `font-size` and `line-height`. This difference
    is divided in half, with one half applied to the top and one half to
    the bottom of the content area. These additions to the content area
    are called, perhaps unsurprisingly, *half-leading*.
    []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080916336 primary="half-leading"
    data-type="indexterm"}Leading is applied only to nonreplaced
    elements.

Inline box

:   This is the box[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080914352
    primary="replaced elements" secondary="inline"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080913344
    primary="inline formatting" secondary="replaced elements"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080912400
    primary="inline boxes"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080911728
    primary="elements" secondary="inline-level" data-type="indexterm"}
    described by the addition of the leading to the content area. For
    nonreplaced elements, the height of the inline box of an element
    will be exactly equal to the value of the `line-height` property.
    For replaced elements, the height of the inline box of an element
    will be exactly equal to the content area, since leading is not
    applied to replaced elements.

Line box

:   This is the []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080908928 primary="line boxes"
    data-type="indexterm"}shortest box that bounds the highest and
    lowest points of the inline boxes that are found in the line. In
    other words, the top edge of the line box is placed along the top of
    the highest inline-box top, and the bottom of the line box is placed
    along the bottom of the lowest inline-box bottom. Remember that
    "top" and "bottom" are considered with respect to the block flow
    direction.

CSS also contains a set of behaviors and useful concepts that fall
outside of the preceding list of terms and definitions:

-   The content area[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080906272
    primary="content area" secondary="inline-level elements"
    data-type="indexterm"} of an inline box is analogous to the content
    box of a block box.

-   The background[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080904272 primary="backgrounds"
    secondary="inline elements" data-type="indexterm"} of an inline
    element is applied to the content area plus any padding.

-   Any border[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080902304 primary="borders"
    secondary="inline elements" data-type="indexterm"} on an inline
    element surrounds the content area plus any padding.

-   Padding, borders, and margins on nonreplaced inline elements have no
    vertical effect on the inline elements or the boxes they generate;
    they do *not* affect the height of an element's inline box (and thus
    the line box that contains the element).

-   Margins and borders on replaced elements *do* affect the height of
    the inline box for that element and, by implication, the height of
    the line box for the line that contains the element.

One more thing to note: inline boxes are vertically aligned within the
line according to their values for the property `vertical-align` (see
[Chapter 15](../Text/ch15.xhtml#text_properties){data-type="xref"}).

Before moving on, let's look at a []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080896096
primary="line boxes" data-type="indexterm"}step-by-step process for
constructing a line box, which you can use to see how the various pieces
of a line fit together to determine its height. Determine the height of
the inline box for each element in the line by following these steps:

1.  Find the []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_line_height_prop
    primary="line-height property" data-type="indexterm"}values of
    `font-size` and `line-height` for each inline nonreplaced element
    and text that is not part of a descendant inline element and combine
    them. This is done by subtracting the `font-size` from the
    `line-height`, which yields the leading for the box. The leading is
    split in half and applied to the top and bottom of each em box.

2.  Find the value of `height`, along with the values for the margins,
    padding, and borders along the block-start and block-end edges of
    each replaced element, and add them together.

3.  Figure out, for each content area, how much of it is above the
    baseline for the overall line and how much of it is below the
    baseline. This is not an easy task: you must know the position of
    the baseline for each element and piece of anonymous text and the
    baseline of the line itself, and then line them all up. In addition,
    the block-end edge of a replaced element sits on the baseline for
    the overall line.

4.  Determine the []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080887888
    primary="vertical-align property" secondary="line heights"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080886880
    primary="vertical formatting"
    secondary="line heights, inline formatting"
    data-type="indexterm"}vertical offset of any elements that have been
    given a value for `vertical-align`. This will tell you how far up or
    down that element's inline box will be moved along the block axis,
    and that will change how much of the element is above or below the
    baseline.

5.  Now that you know where all of the inline boxes have come to rest,
    calculate the final line box height. To do so, just add the distance
    between the baseline and the highest inline-box top to the distance
    between the baseline and the lowest inline-box bottom.

Let us consider the whole process in detail, which is the key to
intelligently styling [inline

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Line Heights" data-type="sect2"}

## Line Heights {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_411}

First, []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_height
primary="inline formatting" secondary="line heights"
data-type="indexterm"}know that all elements have a `line-height`,
whether it's explicitly declared or not. This value greatly influences
the way inline elements are displayed, so let's give it due attention.

A line's height (or the height of a line box) is determined by the
height of its constituent elements and other content, such as text. It's
important to understand that `line-height` affects inline elements and
other inline content, *not* block-level elements---at least, not
directly. We can []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080874240 primary="blocks"
secondary="line height for" data-type="indexterm"}set a `line-height`
value for a block-level element, but the value will have a visual impact
only as it's applied to inline content within that block-level element.
Consider the following empty paragraph, for example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="line-height: 0.25em;"></p>
```

Without content, the paragraph won't have anything to display, so we
won't see anything. The fact that this paragraph has a `line-height` of
any value---be it `0.25em` or `25in`---makes no difference without some
content to create a line box.

We can set a `line-height` value for a block-level element and have that
apply to all of the content within the block, whether it's contained in
an inline element or anonymous text. In a certain sense, then, each line
of text contained within a block-level element is its own inline
element, whether or not it's surrounded by tags. If you like, picture a
fictional tag sequence like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>
<line>This is a paragraph with a number of</line>
<line>lines of text that make up the</line>
<line>contents.</line>
</p>
```

Even though the `line` tags don't actually exist, the paragraph behaves
as if they did, and each line of text "inherits" styles from the
paragraph. You bother to create `line-height` rules for block-level
elements only so you don't have to explicitly declare a `line-height`
for all of their inline elements, fictional or otherwise.

The fictional `line` element clarifies the behavior that results from
setting `line-height` on a block-level element. According to the CSS
specification, declaring `line-height` on a block-level element sets a
*minimum* line-box height for the content of that block-level element.
Declaring `p.spacious {line-height: 24pt;}` means that the *minimum*
height for each line box is 24 points. Technically, content can inherit
this line height only if an inline element does so. Most text isn't
contained by an inline element. If you pretend that each line is
contained by the fictional `line` element, the model works out very
nicely.

primary="inline formatting" secondary="nonreplaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}formatting knowledge, let's move on to the
construction of lines that contain only nonreplaced elements (or
anonymous text). Then you'll be in a good position to understand the
differences between nonreplaced and replaced elements in inline layout.

###### Note {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_413}

In this section, we use *top* and *bottom* to label where half-leading
is placed and how line boxes are placed together.
[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080801376 primary="half-leading"
data-type="indexterm"}Always remember that these terms are in relation
to the direction of block flow: the *top edge* of an inline box is the
one closest to the block-start edge, and the *bottom edge* of an inline
box is closest to its block-end edge. Similarly, *height* means the
distance along the inline box's block axis, and *width* is the distance
along its inline axis.

## Building the Boxes {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_414}

First, for an []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_box
primary="inline formatting" secondary="building boxes"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_nonrep_elem_inline_box
primary="nonreplaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_box_ch6
primary="inline boxes" data-type="indexterm"}inline nonreplaced element
or piece of anonymous text, the value of `font-size` determines the
height of the content area. If an inline element has a `font-size` of
`15px`, the content area's height is 15 pixels because all of the em
boxes in the element are 15 pixels tall, as illustrated in
[Figure 6-44](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig36){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_415"><span class="label">Figure 6-44.
</span>Em boxes determine content area height</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The next thing to consider is the value of `line-height` for the
element, and the difference between it and the value of `font-size`. If
an inline nonreplaced element has a `font-size` of `15px` and a
`line-height` of `21px`, the difference is 6 pixels. The user agent
splits the 6 pixels in half and applies half (3 pixels) to the top and
half (3 pixels) to the bottom of the content area, which yields the
inline box. [Figure 6-45](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig37){data-type="xref"}
illustrates this process.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig37" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0645.png" width="600" height="127"
alt="css5 0645" />
<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_416"><span class="label">Figure 6-45.
</span>Content area plus leading equals inline box</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now, let's break stuff so we can better understand how line height
works. Assume the [following]{.keep-together} is true:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 12px;">
This is text, <em>some of which is emphasized</em>, plus other text<br>
that is <strong style="font-size: 24px;">strongly emphasized</strong>
and that is<br>
larger than the surrounding text.
</p>
```

In this example, most of the text has a `font-size` of `12px`, while the
text in one inline nonreplaced element has a size of `24px`. However,
*all* of the text has a `line-height` of `12px` since `line-height` is
an inherited property. Therefore, the `<strong>` element's `line-height`
is also `12px`.

Thus, for each piece of text where both `font-size` and `line-height`
are `12px`, the content height does not change (since the difference
between `12px` and `12px` is 0), so the inline box is 12 pixels high.
For the strong text, however, the difference between `line-height` and
`font-size` is `-12px`. This is divided in half to determine the
half-leading (`-6px`), and the half-leading is added to both the top and
bottom of the content height to arrive at an inline box. Since we're
adding a negative number in both cases, the inline box ends up being 12
pixels tall. The 12-pixel inline box is centered vertically within the
24-pixel content height of the element, so the inline box is smaller
than the content area.

So far, it sounds like we've done the same thing to each bit of text,
and that all the inline boxes are the same size, but that's not quite
true. The inline boxes in the second line, although they're the same
size, don't line up because the text is all baseline aligned (see
[Figure 6-46](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig38){data-type="xref"}), a concept we'll
discuss later in the chapter.

Since inline boxes determine the height of the overall line box, their
placement with respect to one another is critical. The line box is
defined as the distance from the top of the highest inline box in the
line to the bottom of the lowest inline box, and the top of each line
box butts up against the bottom of the line box for the preceding line.

In [Figure 6-46](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig38){data-type="xref"}, three boxes
are being laid out for a single line of text: the two anonymous text
boxes to either side of the `<strong>` element, and the `<strong>`
element itself. Because the enclosing paragraph has a `line-height` of
`12px`, each of the three boxes will have a 12-pixel-tall inline box.
These inline boxes are centered within the content area of each box. The
boxes then have their baselines lined up, so the text all shares a
common baseline.

But because of where the inline boxes fall with respect to those
baselines, the inline box of the `<strong>` element is a little bit
higher than the inline boxes of the anonymous text boxes. Thus, the
distance from the top of the `<strong>`'s inline box to the bottoms of
the anonymous inline boxes is more than 12 pixels, while the visible
content of the line isn't completely contained within the line box.

</figure>

After all that, the middle line of text is placed between two other
lines of text, as depicted in
[Figure 6-47](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig39){data-type="xref"}. The bottom edge
of the first line of text is placed against the top edge of the line of
text we saw in [Figure 6-46](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig38){data-type="xref"}.
Similarly, the top edge of the third line of text is placed against the
bottom edge of the middle line of text. Because the middle line of text
has a slightly taller line box, the result is that the lines of text
look irregular, because the distances between the three baselines are
not consistent.

data-type="indexterm"}vertical alignment of the inline boxes, the same
height determination principles apply. Suppose that we give the
`<strong>` element a vertical alignment of `4px`:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 12px;">
This is text, <em>some of which is emphasized</em>, plus other text<br>
that is <strong style="font-size: 24px; vertical-align: 4px;">strongly
emphasized</strong>  and that is<br>
larger than the surrounding text.
</p>
```

That small change raises the `<strong>` element 4 pixels, which pushes
up both its content area and its inline box. Because the `<strong>`
element's inline-box top was already the highest in the line, this
change in vertical alignment also pushes the top of the line box upward
by 4 pixels, as shown in
[Figure 6-48](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig40){data-type="xref"}.

A formal definition for `vertical-align` can be found in
[[Chapter 15](../Text/ch15.xhtml#text_properties){data-type="xref"}.]{.keep-together}
:::

Let's consider another situation. Here, we have another inline element
in the same line as the strong text, and its alignment is other than the
baseline:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 12px;">
This is text, <em>some of which is emphasized</em>,<br>
plus other text that is <strong style="font-size: 24px; vertical-align: 4px;">
strong</strong> and <span style="vertical-align: top;">tall</span> and is<br>
larger than the surrounding text.
</p>
```

Now we have the same result as in our earlier example, where the middle
line box is taller than the other line boxes. However, notice how the
"tall" text is aligned in
[Figure 6-49](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig41){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig41" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_423"><span class="label">Figure 6-49.
</span>Aligning an inline element to the line box</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this case, the top of the "tall" text's inline box is aligned with
the top of the line box. Since the "tall" text has equal values for
`font-size` and `line-height`, the content height and inline box are the
same. However, consider this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 12px;">
This is text, <em>some of which is emphasized</em>,<br>
plus other text that is <strong style="font-size: 24px; vertical-align: 4px;">
strong</strong> and <span style="vertical-align: top; line-height: 2px;">
tall</span> and is<br> larger than the surrounding text.
</p>
```

Since the `line-height` for the "tall" text is less than its
`font-size`, the inline box for that element is smaller than its content
area. This tiny fact changes the placement of the text itself, because
the top of its inline box must be aligned with the top of the line box
for its line. Thus, we get the result shown in
[Figure 6-50](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig42){data-type="xref"}.

## Managing the Line Height {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_425}

In previous sections, you saw that changing the `line-height` of an
inline element can cause text from one line to overlap another. In each
case, though, the changes were made to individual elements. So how can
you affect the `line-height` of elements in a more general way in order
to keep content from overlapping?

One way to do this is to use the `em` unit in conjunction with an
element whose `font-size` has changed. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {line-height: 1em;}
strong {font-size: 250%; line-height: 1em;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>
Not only does this paragraph have "normal" text, but it also<br>
contains a line in which <strong>some big text</strong> is found.<br>
This large text helps illustrate our point.
</p>
```

By setting a `line-height` for the `<strong>` element, we increase the
overall height of the line box, providing enough room to display the
`<strong>` element without overlapping any other text and without
changing the `line-height` of all lines in the paragraph. We use a value
of `1em` so that the `line-height` for the `<strong>` element will be
set to the same size as `<strong>`'s `font-size`. Remember,
`line-height` is set in relation to the `font-size` of the element
itself, not the parent element.
[Figure 6-51](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig43){data-type="xref"} shows the
results.

<figure>

</span>Assigning the <code>line-height</code> property to inline
elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Make sure you really understand the previous sections, because readable
formatting of the text gets trickier when we try to add borders. Let's
say we want to put 5-pixel borders around any hyperlink:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:any-link {border: 5px solid blue;}
```

If we don't set a large-enough `line-height` to accommodate the border,
it will be in danger of overwriting other lines. We could increase the
size of the inline box for hyperlinks by using `line-height`, as we did
for the `<strong>` element in the earlier example; in this case, we'd
just need to make the value of `line-height` 10 pixels larger than the
value of `font-size` for those links. However, that will be difficult if
we don't actually know the size of the font in pixels.

Another solution is to increase the `line-height` of the paragraph. This
will affect every line in the entire element, not just the line in which
the bordered hyperlink appears:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {line-height: 1.8em;}
a:link {border: 5px solid blue;}
```

Because extra space is added above and below each line, the border
around the hyperlink doesn't impinge on any other line, as shown in
[Figure 6-52](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig44){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>

</span>Increasing <code>line-height</code> to leave room for inline
borders</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This approach works because all of the text is the same size. If the
line contained other elements that changed the height of the line box,
our border situation might also change. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;}
a:link {border: 5px solid blue;}
strong {font-size: 150%; line-height: 1.5em;}
```

Given these rules, the height of the inline box of a `<strong>` element
within a paragraph will be 31.5 pixels (14 × 1.5 × 1.5), and that will
also be the height of the line box. To keep baseline spacing consistent,
we must make the `<p>` element's `line-height` equal to or greater than
`32px`.

### Understanding baselines and line heights {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_428}

The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080137408 primary="baselines"
secondary="line heights and" data-type="indexterm"}actual height of each
line box depends on the way its component elements line up with one
another. This alignment tends to depend very much on where the baseline
falls within each element (or piece of anonymous text) because that
location determines how the inline boxes are arranged vertically.

Consistent baseline spacing tends to be more of an art than a science.
If you declare all of your font sizes and line heights by using a single
unit, such as ems, you have a good chance of consistent baseline
spacing. If you mix units, however, that feat becomes a great deal more
difficult, if not impossible.

As of late 2022, proposals call for properties that would let authors
enforce consistent baseline spacing regardless of the inline content,
which would greatly simplify certain aspects of online typography. None
of these proposed properties have been implemented, which makes their
adoption a distant hope at best.

::: {#ch06.xhtml_scaling-line-heights .sect3}
### Scaling line heights {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_429}

The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080133280 primary="scaling factor"
data-type="indexterm"}best way to set `line-height`, as it turns out, is
to use a raw number as the value. This method is best because the number
becomes the *scaling factor*, and that factor is an inherited, not a
computed, value. Let's say we want the `line-height` of all elements in
a document to be one and a half times their `font-size`. We would
declare the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {line-height: 1.5;}
```

This scaling factor of 1.5 is passed down from element to element, and,
at each level, the factor is used as a multiplier of the `font-size` of
each element. Therefore, the following markup would be displayed as
shown in [Figure 6-53](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig45){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;}
small {font-size: 66%;}
strong {font-size: 200%;}

<p>This paragraph has a line-height of 1.5 times its font-size. In addition,
any elements within it <small>such as this small element</small> also have
line-heights 1.5 times their font-size...and that includes <strong>this big
element right here</strong>. By using a scaling factor, line-heights scale
to match the font-size of any element.</p>
```

In this example, the line height for the `<small>` element turns out to
be 15 pixels, and for the `<strong>` element, it's 45 pixels. If we
don't want our big `<strong>` text to generate too much extra leading,
we can give it its own `line-height` value, which will override the
inherited scaling factor:[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797080004960 primary=""

## Adding Box Properties to Nonreplaced Elements {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_431}

As you []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_nonrep
primary="inline formatting" secondary="nonreplaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}may recall from previous discussions, while
padding, margins, and borders may all be applied to inline nonreplaced
elements, these properties have no impact on the height of the inline
element's line box.

The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079881536 primary="borders"
secondary="inline elements" data-type="indexterm"}border edge of inline
elements is controlled by `font-size`, not `line-height`. In other
words, if a `<span>` element has a `font-size` of `12px` and a
`line-height` of `36px`, its content area is `12px` high, and the border
will surround that content area.

Alternatively, we can assign padding to the inline element, which will
push the borders away from the text itself:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
span {padding: 4px;}
```

This []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083769712 primary="inline formatting"
secondary="padding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797083768976 primary="padding"
secondary="inline elements" data-type="indexterm"}padding does not alter
the actual shape of the content height, and so it will not affect the
height of the inline box for this element. Similarly, adding borders to
an inline element will not affect the way line boxes are generated and
laid out, as illustrated in
[Figure 6-54](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig47){data-type="xref"} (both with and
without the 4-pixel padding).

<figure>

alt="css5 0654" />
<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_432"><span class="label">Figure 6-54.
</span>Padding and borders do not alter line height</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As for margins, they do not, practically speaking, apply to the block
edges of an inline nonreplaced element, as they don't affect the height
of the line box. The inline ends of the element are another story.

Recall the idea that an inline element is basically laid out as a single
line and then broken into pieces. So, if we apply margins to an inline
element, those margins will appear at its beginning and end: these are
the inline-start and inline-end margins, respectively. Padding also
appears at these edges. Thus, although padding and margins (and borders)
do not affect line heights, they can still affect the layout of an
element's content by pushing text away from its ends. In fact, negative
inline-start and -end margins can pull text closer to the inline
element, or even cause overlap.

So, what []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079839232 primary="inline formatting"
secondary="background" data-type="indexterm"}happens when an inline
element has a background and enough padding to cause the lines'
backgrounds to overlap? Take the following situation as an example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: 15px; line-height: 1em;}
p span {background: #FAA;
     padding-block-start: 10px; padding-block-end: 10px;}
```

All of the text within the `<span>` element will have a content area 15
pixels tall, and we've applied 10 pixels of padding to the top and
bottom of each content area. The extra pixels won't increase the height
of the line box, which would be fine, except there is a background
color. Thus, we get the result shown in
[Figure 6-55](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig48){data-type="xref"}.

</span>Padding and margins on inline elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

CSS explicitly states that the line boxes are drawn in document order:
"This will cause the borders on subsequent lines to paint over the
borders and text of previous lines." The same principle applies to
backgrounds as well, as
[Figure 6-55](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig48){data-type="xref"}
shows.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079764192 primary=""

that when an inline nonreplaced element is broken across multiple lines,
it's treated as if it were one long single-line element that's sliced
into smaller boxes, one slice per line break.

data-type="indexterm"}That's just the default behavior, and it can be
changed via the property `box-decoration-break`.

The default value, `slice`, is what you saw in the previous section. The
other value, `clone`, causes each fragment of the element to be drawn as
if it were a standalone box. What does that mean? Compare the two
examples in [Figure 6-56](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig50){data-type="xref"}, in
which exactly the same markup and styles are treated as either sliced or
cloned.

Many of the differences may be apparent, but a few are perhaps more
subtle. Among the effects are the application of padding to each
element's fragment, including at the ends where the line breaks occur.
Similarly, the border is drawn around each fragment individually,
instead of being broken up.

</span>Sliced and cloned inline fragments</h6>
</div>
</figure>

More subtly, notice how the `background-image` positioning changes
between the two. In the sliced version, background images are sliced
along with everything else, meaning that only one of the fragments
contains the origin image. In the cloned version, however, each
background acts as its own copy, so each has its own origin image. This
means, for example, that even if we have a nonrepeated background image,
it will appear once in each fragment instead of in only one fragment.

The `box-decoration-break` property will most often be used with inline
boxes, but it applies anytime there's a break in an element---for
example, when a page break interrupts an element in paged media. In such
a case, each fragment is a separate slice. If we set
`box-decoration-break: clone`, each box fragment will be treated as a
copy when it comes to borders, padding, backgrounds, and so on. The same
holds true in multicolumn layout: if an element is split by a column
break, the value of `box-decoration-break` will affect how it is
rendered.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079722048
primary="inline formatting" secondary="content area versus glyphs"
data-type="indexterm"}when you try to keep inline nonreplaced element
backgrounds from overlapping, it can still happen, depending on which
font is in use. The problem lies in the difference between a font's em
box and its character glyphs. Most fonts, as it turns out, don't have em
boxes whose heights match the character glyphs.

That []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079720528 primary="em box (em square)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079719792 primary="boxes"
secondary="em box (em square)" data-type="indexterm"}may sound abstract,
but it has practical consequences. The "painting area" of an inline
nonreplaced element is left to the user agent. If a user agent takes the
em box to be the height of the content area, the background of an inline
nonreplaced element will be equal to the height of the em box (which is
the value of `font-size`). If a user agent uses the maximum ascender and
descender of the font, the background may be taller or shorter than the
em box. Therefore, you could give an inline nonreplaced element a
`line-height` of `1em` and still have its background overlap the content
of other lines.

Inline []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_replaced_elem_inline
primary="replaced elements" secondary="inline"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_replaced
primary="inline formatting" secondary="replaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}replaced elements, such as images, are assumed to
have an intrinsic height and width; for example, an image will be a
certain number of pixels high and wide. Therefore, a replaced element
with an intrinsic height can cause a line box to become taller than
normal. This does *not* change the value of `line-height` for any
element in the line, *including the replaced element itself*. Instead,
the line box is made just tall enough to accommodate the replaced
element, plus any box properties. In other words, the entirety of the
replaced element---content, margins, borders, and padding---is used to
define the element's inline box. The following styles lead to one such
example, as shown in
[Figure 6-57](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig51){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;}
img {block-size: 30px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none;}

Despite all the []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079648848
primary="vertical formatting" secondary="alignment setting"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079647840
primary="alignment" secondary="vertical"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079646896
primary="line-height property" data-type="indexterm"}blank space, the
effective value of `line-height` has not changed, either for the
paragraph or the image itself. The `line-height` value has no effect on
the image's inline box. Because the image in
[Figure 6-57](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig51){data-type="xref"} has no padding,
margins, or borders, its inline box is equivalent to its content area,
which is, in this case, 30 pixels tall.

Nonetheless, an inline replaced element still has a value for
`line-height`. Why? In the most common case, it needs the value in order
to correctly position the element if it's been vertically aligned.
Recall that, for example, percentage values for `vertical-align` are
calculated with respect to an element's `line-height`. Thus:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;}
img {vertical-align: 50%;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>The image in this sentence <img src="test.gif" alt="test">
will be raised 9 pixels.</p>
```

The inherited value of `line-height` causes the image to be raised 9
pixels instead of some other number. Without a value for `line-height`,
it wouldn't be possible to perform percentage-value vertical alignments.
The height of the image itself has no relevance when it comes to
vertical alignment; the value of `line-height` is all that matters.

However, for other replaced elements, it might be important to pass on a
`line-height` value to descendant elements within that replaced element.
An example would be an SVG image, which can use CSS to style text found
within the image.

## Adding Box Properties to Replaced Elements {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_440}

After everything we've just been through, applying margins, borders, and
padding to inline replaced elements seems almost simple.

Padding and borders[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079570688
primary="replaced elements" secondary="padding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079569680

secondary="replaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079567792 primary="borders"
secondary="replaced elements" data-type="indexterm"} are applied to
replaced elements as usual; padding inserts space around the actual
content, and the border surrounds the padding. What's unusual about the
process is that the padding and border actually influence the height of
the line box because they are part of the inline box of an inline
replaced element (unlike with inline nonreplaced elements). Consider
[Figure 6-58](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig52){data-type="xref"}, which results
from the following styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {block-size: 50px; inline-size: 50px;}
img.one {margin: 0; padding: 0; border: 3px dotted;}
img.two {margin: 10px; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid;}
```

Note that the first line box is made tall enough to contain the image,
whereas the second is tall enough to contain the image, its padding, and
its border.

Margins[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079499648 primary="margins"
secondary="replaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079498640
primary="replaced elements" secondary="margins" data-type="indexterm"}
are also contained within the line box, but they have their own
wrinkles. Setting a positive margin is no mystery; it will make the
inline box of the replaced element taller. Setting negative margins has
a similar effect: it decreases the size of the replaced element's inline
box. This is illustrated in
[Figure 6-59](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig53){data-type="xref"}, where we can see
that a negative top margin is pulling down the line above the image:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.two {margin-block-start: -10px;}
```

Negative []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797079455088 primary="negative margins"
data-type="indexterm"}margins operate the same way on block-level
elements, as shown earlier in the chapter. In this case, the negative
margins make the replaced element's inline box smaller than ordinary.
Negative margins are the only way to cause inline replaced elements to
bleed into other lines, and it's why the boxes that replaced inline
elements generate are often assumed to be inline-block.

## Replaced Elements and the Baseline {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_443}

You may have []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_baseline
primary="inline formatting" secondary="baselines"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_ix_baseline_replaced
primary="baselines" secondary="inline replaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}noticed by now that, by default, inline replaced
elements sit on the baseline. If you add bottom (block-end) padding, a
margin, or a border to the replaced element, then the content area will
move upward along the block axis. Replaced elements do not have
baselines of their own, so the next best thing is to align the bottom of
their inline boxes with the baseline. Thus, it is actually the outer
block-end margin edge that is aligned with the baseline, as illustrated
in [Figure 6-60](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig54){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="width-75">
<div id="ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig54" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_444"><span class="label">Figure 6-60.
</span>Inline replaced elements sit on the baseline</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This baseline alignment leads to an unexpected (and unwelcome)
consequence: an image placed in a table cell all by itself should make
the table cell tall enough to contain the line box containing the image.
The resizing occurs even if no actual text, not even whitespace, is in
the table cell with the image. Therefore, the common sliced-image and
spacer-GIF designs of years past can fall apart quite dramatically in
modern browsers. (We know that *you* don't create such things, but this
is still a handy context in which to explain this behavior.) Consider
the simplest case:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
td {font-size: 12px;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<td><img src="spacer.gif" height="1" width="10" alt=""></td>
```

Under the CSS inline formatting model, the table cell will be 12 pixels
tall, with the image sitting on the baseline of the cell. So we might
have 3 pixels of space below the image and 8 above it, although the
exact distances would depend on the font family used and the placement
of its baseline.

This behavior is not confined to images inside table cells; it will also
happen anytime an inline replaced element is the sole descendant of a
block-level or table-cell element. For example, an image inside a
`<div>` will also sit on the baseline.

Here's another interesting effect of inline replaced elements sitting on
the baseline: if we apply a negative bottom (block-end) margin, the
element will get pulled downward because the bottom of its inline box
will be higher than the bottom of its content area. Thus, the following
rule would have the result shown in
[Figure 6-61](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig55){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p img {margin-block-end: -10px;}

## Inline-Block Elements {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_446}

As befits the []{#ch06.xhtml_ix_inline_format_inblock
primary="inline formatting" secondary="inline-block elements"
data-type="indexterm"}hybrid look of the value name `inline-block`,
inline-block elements are indeed a hybrid of block-level and inline
elements.

An inline-block element relates to other elements and content as an
inline box just as an image would: inline-block elements are formatted
within a line as a replaced element. This means the bottom (block-end)
edge of the inline-block element will rest on the baseline of the text
line by default and will not line break within itself.

Inside the inline-block element, the content is formatted as though the
element were block-level. The properties `width` and `height` apply to
the element (and thus so does `box-sizing`), as they do to any
block-level or inline replaced element, and those properties will
increase the height of the line if they are taller than the surrounding
content.

Let's consider some example markup that should help make this clearer:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div id="one">
   This text is the content of a block-level element. Within this
   block-level element is another block-level element.  <p>Look, it's a
   block-level paragraph.</p> Here's the rest of the DIV, which is still
   block-level.
</div>
<div id="two">
   This text is the content of a block-level element. Within this
   block-level element is an inline element.  <p>Look, it's an inline
   paragraph.</p>  Here's the rest of the DIV, which is still block-level.
</div>
<div id="three">
   This text is the content of a block-level element. Within this
   block-level element is an inline-block element.  <p>Look, it's an inline-block
   paragraph.</p>  Here's the rest of the DIV, which is still block-level.
</div>
```

To this markup, we apply the following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {margin: 1em 0; border: 1px solid;}
p {border: 1px dotted;}
div#one p {display: block; inline-size: 6em; text-align: center;}
div#two p {display: inline; inline-size: 6em; text-align: center;}
div#three p {display: inline-block; inline-size: 6em; text-align: center;}

</figure>

Notice that in the second `<div>`, the inline paragraph is formatted as
normal inline content, which means `width` and `text-align` get ignored
(since they do not apply to inline elements). For the third `<div>`,
however, the inline-block paragraph honors both properties, since it is
formatted as a block-level element. That paragraph's margins also force
its line of text to be much taller, since it affects line height as
though it were a replaced [element.]{.keep-together}

If an inline-block element's `width` is not defined or explicitly
declared `auto`, the element box will shrink to fit the content. The
element box is exactly as wide as necessary to hold the content, and no
wider. Inline boxes act the same way, although they can break across
lines of text, whereas inline-block elements cannot. Thus, we have the
following rule, when applied to the previous markup
example:[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078976080 primary=""
startref="ix_inline_format_inblock" data-type="indexterm"}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#three p {display: inline-block; block-size: 4em;}
```

This will create a tall box that's just wide enough to enclose the
content, as shown in
[Figure 6-63](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_fig57){data-type="xref"}.

## Flow Display {#ch06.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_449}

The `display` values `flow` and `flow-root` deserve a moment of
explanation. []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078954128 primary="display property"
secondary="flow display"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078930944

primary="flow-root display"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078928880
primary="inline formatting" secondary="flow display"
data-type="indexterm"}Declaring an element to be laid out using
`display: flow` means that it should use block-and-inline layout, the
same as normal---that is, unless it's combined with `inline`, in which
case it generates an inline box.

In other words, the first two of the following rules will result in a
block box, whereas the third will yield an inline box:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#first {display: flow;}
#second {display: block flow;}
#third {display: inline flow;}
```

The []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078899120 primary="display roles"

primary="inner display type"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078897632
primary="outer display type" data-type="indexterm"}reason for this
pattern is that CSS is (very) slowly moving to a system that supports
two kinds of display: the *outer display type* and the *inner display
type*. Value keywords like `block` and `inline` represent the outer
display type, which determines how the display box interacts with its
surroundings. The inner display (in this case, `flow`), describes what
should happen inside the element.

This approach allows for declarations like `display: inline block` to
indicate that an element should generate a block-formatting context
within, but relate to its surrounding content as an inline element. (The
new two-term `display` value has the same effect as the fully supported
`inline-block` value.)

Using `display: flow-root`, on the other hand, always generates a block
box, with a new block formatting context inside itself. This is the sort
of thing that would be applied to the root element of a document, like
`<html>`, to say, "This is where the formatting root lies."

The old `display` values you may be familiar with are still available.
[Table 6-1](#ch06.xhtml_display_values_reference){data-type="xref"}

A []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078844848 primary="display roles"
secondary="contents display"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078843840
primary="inline formatting" secondary="content display"
data-type="indexterm"}fascinating new addition to `display` is the value
`contents`. When applied to an element, `display: contents` causes the
element to be removed from page formatting, and effectively "elevates"
its child elements to its level. As an example, consider the following
basic CSS and HTML:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {border: 1px solid red;}
li {border: 1px solid silver;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ul>
<li>The first list item.</li>
<li>List Item II: The Listening.</li>
<li>List item the third.</li>
</ul>
```

This yields an unordered list with a red border, and three list items
with silver borders.

If we then apply `display: contents` to the `<ul>` element, the user
agent will render the list as if the `<ul>` and `</ul>` lines had been
deleted from the document source.
[Figure 6-64](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_css4_display_contents){data-type="xref"}
shows the difference between the regular result and the `contents`
result.

The list items are still list items, and act like them, but visually,
the `<ul>` is gone, as if it had never been. Not only does the list's
border go away, but also the top and bottom margins that usually
separate the list from surrounding content. This is why the second list
in
[Figure 6-64](#ch06.xhtml_bvf_css4_display_contents){data-type="xref"}
appears higher up than the first.

`visibility: visible`, it is, as you might expect, visible. If an
element is set to `visibility: hidden`, it is made "invisible" (to use
the wording in the specification). In its invisible state, the element
still affects the document's layout as though it were `visible`. In
other words, the element is still there---you just can't see it.

Note the difference between this and `display: none`. In the latter
case, the element is not displayed *and* is removed from the document
altogether so that it doesn't have any effect on document layout.
[Figure 6-65](#ch06.xhtml_making_elements_invisible){data-type="xref"}

Everything visible about a hidden element---such as content, background,
and borders---is made invisible. The space is still there because the
element is still part of the document's layout. We just can't see it.

We can set the descendant element of a `hidden` element to be `visible`.
This causes the element to appear wherever it normally would, even
though the ancestor is invisible. To do so, we explicitly declare the
descendant element `visible`, since `visibility` is
[inherited:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.clear {visibility: hidden;}
p.clear em {visibility: visible;}
```

As for `visibility: collapse`, this value is used in CSS table rendering
and flexible box layout, where it has an effect very similar to
`display: none`. The difference is that in table rendering, a row or
column that's been set to `visibility: hidden` is hidden and the space
it would have occupied is removed, but any cells in the hidden row or
column are used to determine the layout of intersecting columns or rows.
This allows you to quickly hide or show rows and columns without forcing
the browser to recalculate the layout of the whole table.

If `collapse` is applied to an element that isn't a flex item or part of
a table, it has the same meaning as `hidden`.

If you []{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078588704 primary="animation"
secondary="of visibility" secondary-sortas="visibility"
data-type="indexterm"}want to animate a change from visible visibility
to one of the other values of [`visibility`,]{.keep-together} that is
possible. The catch is that you won't see a slow fade from one to the
other. Instead, the browser calculates where in the animation a change
from `0` to `1` (or vice versa) would reach the end value, and instantly
changes the value of `visibility` at that point. Thus, if an element is
set to `visibility: hidden` and then animated to
` `[`visibility:`]{.keep-together}` visible`, the element will be
completely invisible until the end point is reached, at which time it
will become instantly visible. (See Chapters

Although some aspects of the CSS formatting model may seem
counterintuitive at first, they begin to make sense the more you work
with them. In many cases, rules that seem nonsensical or even idiotic
turn out to exist in order to prevent bizarre or otherwise undesirable
document displays. Block-level elements are in many ways easy to
understand, and affecting their layout is typically a simple
task.[]{#ch06.xhtml_idm45797078575344 primary=""
startref="ix_vis_format_ch6" data-type="indexterm"} Inline elements, on
the other hand, can be trickier to manage, as multiple factors come into
play, not the least of which is whether the element is replaced or
nonreplaced.

In

we talked about the basics of element display. In this chapter, we'll
look at the CSS properties and values you can use to affect how element
boxes are drawn and separated from one another. These include the
padding, borders, and margins around an element, as well as any outlines
that may be added.

secondary="in box model" secondary-sortas="box model"
data-type="indexterm"}discussed in the preceding chapter, all document
elements generate a rectangular box called the *element box*, which
describes the amount of space that an element occupies in the layout of
the document. Therefore, each box influences the position and size of
other element boxes. For example, if the first element box in the
document is an inch tall, the next box will begin at least an inch below
the top of the document. If the first element box is changed and made to
be 2 inches tall, every following element box will shift downward an
inch, and the second element box will begin at least 2 inches below the
top of the [document.]{.keep-together}

By default, a visually rendered document is composed of numerous
rectangular boxes that are distributed so that they don't overlap. Boxes
can overlap if they have been manually positioned or placed on a grid,
and visual overlap can occur if negative margins are used on normal-flow
elements.

To understand how margins, padding, and borders are handled, you must
understand the *box model*, illustrated in
[Figure 7-1](#ch07.xhtml_TheCSSboxmodel){data-type="xref"}.

By default, []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797078480016 primary="borders"
secondary="padding and" data-type="indexterm"}elements have no padding.
The separation between paragraphs, for example, has traditionally been
enforced with margins alone (as you'll see later). On the other hand,
without padding, the border of an element will come very close to the
content of the element itself. Thus, when putting a border on an
element, it's usually a good idea to add some padding as well, as
[Figure 7-3](#ch07.xhtml_Theeffectofpaddingonborderedblock-levelelements){data-type="xref"}
illustrates.

<figure class="bordernone">

</span>The effect of padding on bordered block-level elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Any length value is permitted, from ems to inches. The simplest way to
set padding is with a single length value, which is applied equally to
all four padding sides. At times, however, you might desire a different
amount of padding on each side of an element. If you want all `<h1>`
elements to have a top padding of 10 pixels, a right padding of 20
pixels, a bottom padding of 15 pixels, and a left padding of 5 pixels,
you can just say this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;}
```

The order of the values is important and follows this pattern:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
padding: top right bottom left
```

A good way to remember this pattern is to keep in mind that the four
values go clockwise around the element, starting from the top. The
padding values are *always* applied in this order, so to get the effect
you want, you have to arrange the values correctly.

An easy way to remember the order in which sides must be declared, other
than thinking of it as being clockwise from the top, is to keep in mind
that getting the sides in the correct order helps you avoid
"TRouBLe"---that is, *TRBL*, for *top, right, bottom, left*.

This ordering reveals that `padding`, like `height` and `width`, is a
physical property: it refers to the physical directions of the page,
such as top or left, rather than being based on writing direction. (CSS
does have writing-mode padding properties, as you'll see in a bit.)

It's entirely possible to mix up the types of length values you use. You
aren't restricted to using a single length type in a given rule, but can
use whatever makes sense for a given side of the element, as shown here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {padding: 14px 5em 0.1in 3ex;} /* value variety! */
```

Sometimes the []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_rep_value_padding
primary="replicating values, padding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_value_rep_padding
primary="values" secondary="replicating in padding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_padding_rep_value
primary="padding" secondary="replicating values"
data-type="indexterm"}values you enter can get a little repetitive:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {padding: 0.25em 1em 0.25em 1em;}  /* TRBL - Top Right Bottom Left */
```

You don't have to keep typing in pairs of numbers like this, though.
Instead of the [preceding]{.keep-together} rule, try this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {padding: 0.25em 1em;}
```

These two values are enough to take the place of four. But how? CSS
defines a few rules to accommodate fewer than four values for `padding`
(and many other shorthand properties):

-   If the value for *left* is missing, use the value provided for
    *right*.

-   If the value for *bottom* is also missing, use the value provided
    for *top*.

-   If the value for *right* is also missing, use the value provided for
    *top*.

If you prefer a more visual approach, take a look at
[Figure 7-5](#ch07.xhtml_Valuereplicationpattern){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Valuereplicationpattern" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0705.png" width="600" height="140"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_469"><span class="label">Figure 7-5.
</span>Value-replication pattern</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In other words, if three values are given for `padding`, the fourth
(*left*) is copied from the second (*right*). If two values are given,
the fourth is copied from the second, and the third (*bottom*) from the
first (*top*). Finally, if only one value is given, all the other sides
copy that value.

This mechanism allows you to supply only as many values as necessary, as
shown here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {padding: 0.25em 0 0.5em;} /* same as '0.25em 0 0.5em 0' */
h2 {padding: 0.15em 0.2em;}   /* same as '0.15em 0.2em 0.15em 0.2em' */
p {padding: 0.5em 10px;}      /* same as '0.5em 10px 0.5em 10px' */
p.close {padding: 0.1em;}     /* same as '0.1em 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em' */
```

The method presents a small drawback, which you're bound to eventually
encounter. Suppose you want to set the top and left padding for `<h1>`
elements to be 10 pixels, [and the]{.keep-together} bottom and right
padding to be 20 pixels. You'd have to write the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {padding: 10px 20px 20px 10px;} /* can't be any shorter */
```

You get what you want, but it takes a while to get it all in.
Unfortunately, there is no way to cut down on the number of values
needed in such a circumstance. Let's take another example, one where you
want all of the padding to be 0---except for the left padding, which
should be 3 em:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {padding: 0 0 0 3em;}
```

Using []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797078198544 primary="margins"
secondary="padding and"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797078197696 primary="padding"
secondary="margins and" data-type="indexterm"}padding to separate the
content areas of elements can be trickier than using the traditional
margins, although it's not without its rewards. For example, to keep
paragraphs the traditional "one blank line" apart with padding, you'd
have to write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {margin: 0; padding: 0.5em 0;}
```

The half-em top and bottom padding of each paragraph butt up against
each other and total an em of separation. Why would you bother to do
this? Because then you could insert separation borders between the
paragraphs, and the side borders will touch to form the appearance of a
solid line. The following code defines these effects, illustrated in
[Figure 7-6](#ch07.xhtml_Usingpaddinginsteadofmargins){data-type="xref"}:[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797078153728

CSS []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_singleside_padding primary="single-side padding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_padding_singleside
primary="padding" secondary="single-side" data-type="indexterm"}provides
a way to assign a value to the padding on a single side of an
[element.]{.keep-together} Four ways, actually. Let's say you want to
set only the left padding of `<h2>` [elements]{.keep-together} to be
`3em`. Rather than writing out `padding: 0 0 0 3em`, you can take this
approach:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {padding-left: 3em;}
```

The `padding-left` option is one of []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797078068768

```
These properties operate in a manner consistent with their names. For
example, the following two rules will yield the same amount of padding
(assuming no other CSS):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {padding: 0 0 0 0.25in;}
h2 {padding-left: 0.25in;}
```

Similarly, these rules will create equal padding:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {padding: 0.25in 0 0;}  /* left padding is copied from right padding */
h2 {padding-top: 0.25in;}
```

For that matter, so will these rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {padding: 0 0.25in;}
h2 {padding-right: 0.25in; padding-left: 0.25in;}
```

It's possible to use more than one of these single-side properties in a
single rule; [for example:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 2em;
    padding-right: 0; padding-top: 0;
    background: silver;}
```

As you can see in
[Figure 7-7](#ch07.xhtml_Morethanonesingle-sidepadding){data-type="xref"},
the padding is set as we wanted. In this case, it might have been easier
to use `padding` after all, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {padding: 0 0 2em 3em;}
```

In general, once you're trying to set padding for more than one side,
it's easier to use the shorthand `padding`. From the standpoint of your
document's display, however, it doesn't really matter which approach you
use, so choose whichever is easiest for

These []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077774144 primary="backgrounds"
secondary="padding with" data-type="indexterm"}properties are handy when
you want to make sure your text has padding that has a consistent effect
regardless of the writing direction. For example, you might want a
little bit of padding to set the background edges away from the start
and end of each block element, and more padding to the sides of each
line of text. Here's a way to make that [happen]{.keep-together}, with
the result shown in

Percentage values for these logical padding properties are always
calculated with respect to the *physical* width or height of the
element's container, not its logical width or height. Thus, for example,
`padding-inline-start: 10%` will calculate to 100 pixels when the
container has `width: 1000px`, even in a vertical writing mode. This may
change going forward, but that is the consistent (and specified)
behavior as of late 2022.

With these shorthand properties, you can set block padding in one go,
and inline padding in another. The following CSS would have the same
result as that shown in ["Logical
Padding"](#ch07.xhtml_logical-padding){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {
     padding-block: 0.25em;
     padding-inline: 1em;
}
```

Each property accepts one or two values. If there are two values,
they're always in the order *start end*. If there's only one value, as
shown before, the same value is used for both the start and end sides.
Thus, to give an element 10 pixels of block-start padding and 1 em of
block-end padding, you could write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {
     padding-block: 10px 1em;
}
```

A more compact shorthand doesn't exist for logical padding,
unfortunately---no `padding-logical` that accepts four values, the way
`padding` does. Proposals have been made to extend the `padding`
property with a keyword value (such as `logical`) to allow it to set
logical padding instead of physical padding, but as of late 2022, those
proposals have not been adopted. As of this writing, the most compact
you can get with logical padding is to use `padding-block` and
`padding-inline`.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077620240 primary=""

## Percentage Values and Padding {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_479}

We can set []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_padding_percent primary="padding"
secondary="percentage values" data-type="indexterm"}percentage values
for the padding of an element. Percentages are computed in relation to
the width of the parent element's content area, so they change if the
parent element's width changes in some way.

For example, assume the following, which is illustrated in
[Figure 7-9](#ch07.xhtml_Paddingpercentagesandthewidthsofparentelements){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {padding: 10%; background-color: silver;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="width: 600px;">
    <p>
        This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 600 pixels,
        so its padding will be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent
        element. Given the declared width of 600 pixels, the padding will be 60
        pixels on all sides.
    </p>
</div>
<div style="width: 300px;">
    <p>
        This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 300 pixels,
        so its padding will still be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent.
        There will, therefore, be half as much padding on this paragraph as
        on the first paragraph.

You may have noticed something odd about the paragraphs in
[Figure 7-9](#ch07.xhtml_Paddingpercentagesandthewidthsofparentelements){data-type="xref"}.
Not only did their side padding change according to the width of their
parent elements, but so did their top and bottom padding. That's the
desired behavior in CSS. Refer back to the property definition, and
you'll see that percentage values are defined to be relative to the
*width* of the parent element. This applies to the top and bottom
padding as well as to the left and right. Thus, given the following
styles and markup, the top padding of the paragraph will be 50 pixels:

``` {.pagebreak-before code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div p {padding-top: 10%;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="width: 500px;">
    <p>
        This is a paragraph, and its top margin is 10% the width of its parent
        element.
    </p>
</div>
```

If all this seems strange, consider that most elements in the normal
flow are (as we are assuming) as tall as necessary to contain their
descendant elements, including padding. If an element's top and bottom
padding were a percentage of the parent's height, an infinite loop could
result where the parent's height was increased to accommodate the top
and bottom padding, which would then have to increase to match the new
height, and so on.

Rather than ignore percentages for top and bottom padding, the
specification authors decided to make it relate to the width of the
parent's content area, which does not change based on the width of its
descendants. This allows authors to get a consistent padding all the way
around an element by using the same percentage on all four sides.

By contrast, consider elements without a declared width. In such cases,
the overall width of the element box (including padding) is dependent on
the width of the parent element. []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077472976
primary="fluid pages" data-type="indexterm"}This leads to the
possibility of *fluid* pages, where the padding on elements enlarges or
reduces to match the actual size of the parent element. If you style a
document so that its elements use percentage padding, then as the user
changes the width of a browser window, the padding will expand or shrink
to fit. The design choice is up to you.

You also can mix percentages with length values. Thus, to set `<h2>`
elements to have top and bottom padding of one-half em, and side padding
of 10% the width of their parent elements, you can declare the
following, illustrated in
[Figure 7-10](#ch07.xhtml_Mixedpadding){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {padding: 0.5em 10%;}

Here, although the top and bottom padding will stay constant in any
situation, the side padding will change based on the width of the parent
element.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077451136 primary=""

You may []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_padding_inline_elem primary="padding"
secondary="inline elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_inline_format_padding
primary="inline formatting" secondary="padding"
data-type="indexterm"}have noticed that the discussion so far has been
solely about padding set for elements that generate block boxes. When
padding is applied to inline nonreplaced [elements]{.keep-together}, the
effects are a little different.

Let's say you want to set top and bottom padding on strongly emphasized
text:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom: 50px;}
```

This is allowed in the specification, but since you're applying the
padding to an inline nonreplaced element, it will have absolutely no
effect on the line height. []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_background_padding
primary="backgrounds" secondary="padding with"
data-type="indexterm"}Since padding is transparent when there's no
visible background, the preceding declaration will have no visual effect
whatsoever. This happens because padding on inline nonreplaced elements
doesn't change the line height of an element.

Be careful: an inline nonreplaced element with a background color and
padding can have a background that extends above and below the element,
like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {padding-top: 0.5em; background-color: silver;}
```

[Figure 7-11](#ch07.xhtml_Paddingonaninlinenonreplacedelement){data-type="xref"}
gives you an idea of what this might look like.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Paddingonaninlinenonreplacedelement" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_483"><span class="label">Figure 7-11.
</span>Top padding on an inline nonreplaced element</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The line height isn't changed, but since the background color does
extend into the padding, each line's background ends up overlapping the
lines that come before it. That's the expected result.

The preceding behaviors are true only for the top and bottom sides of
inline [nonreplaced]{.keep-together} elements; the left and right sides
are a different story. We'll start by considering the case of a small,
inline nonreplaced element within a single line. Here, if you set values
for the left or right padding, they will be visible, as
[Figure 7-12](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwithleftpadding){data-type="xref"}
makes clear (so to speak):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {padding-left: 25px; background: silver;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwithleftpadding"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0712.png" width="600" height="40"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_484"><span class="label">Figure 7-12.
</span>An inline nonreplaced element with left padding</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note the extra space between the end of the word just before the inline
nonreplaced element and the edge of the inline element's background. You
can add that extra space to both ends of the inline if you want:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 25px; background: silver;}
```

As expected,
[Figure 7-13](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwith25-pixelsidepadding){data-type="xref"}
shows a little extra space on the right and left sides of the inline
element, and no extra space above or below it.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwith25-pixelsidepadding"

</span>An inline nonreplaced element with 25-pixel side padding</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now, when an inline nonreplaced element stretches across multiple lines,
the situation changes a bit.
[Figure 7-14](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwith25-pixelsidepaddingdisplayedacrosstwolinesoftext){data-type="xref"}
shows what happens when an inline nonreplaced element with padding is
displayed across multiple lines:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {padding: 0 25px; background: silver;}
```

The left padding is applied to the beginning of the element, and the
right padding to the end of it. By default, padding is *not* applied to
the right and left side of each line. Also, you can see that, if not for
the padding, the line may have broken after "background" instead of
where it did. The `padding` property affects line breaking only by
changing the point at which the element's content begins within a line.

The way padding is (or isn't) applied to the ends of each line box can
be altered with the property `box-decoration-break`. See

## Padding and Replaced Elements {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_488}

It is []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077221808 primary="padding"
secondary="replaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077220800
primary="replaced elements" secondary="padding"
data-type="indexterm"}possible to apply padding to replaced elements.
The most surprising case for most people is that you can apply padding
to an image, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {background: silver; padding: 1em;}
```

Regardless of whether the replaced element is block-level or inline, the
padding will surround its content, and the background color will fill
into that padding, as shown in
[Figure 7-15](#ch07.xhtml_Paddingreplacedelements){data-type="xref"}.
You can also see that padding will push a replaced element's border
(dashed, in this case) away from its content.

</span>Padding, borders, and background on a replaced element</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now, remember all that stuff about how padding on inline nonreplaced
elements doesn't affect the height of the lines of text? You can throw
it all out for *replaced* elements, because they have a different set of
rules. As you can see in
[Figure 7-16](#ch07.xhtml_Paddingreplacedelements2){data-type="xref"},
the padding of an inline replaced element very much affects the height
of the line.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Paddingreplacedelements2" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0716.png" width="600" height="122"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_490"><span class="label">Figure 7-16.
</span>Padding an inline replaced element</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The same goes for borders and margins, as you'll soon see.

Note that if the image in
[Figure 7-16](#ch07.xhtml_Paddingreplacedelements2){data-type="xref"}
had not loaded, or had somehow been set to have 0 height and width, the
padding would still be rendered around the spot where the element should
have been displayed, even if that spot has no height or width.

###### Warning {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_491}

As of late 2022, uncertainty []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077182352

what to do about styling form elements such as `<input>`, which are
replaced elements. It is not entirely clear where the padding of a
checkbox resides, for example. Therefore, as of this writing, some
browsers ignore padding (and other forms of styling) for form elements,
while others apply the styles as best they
can.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077179648 primary=""

# Borders {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_492}

Beyond the padding of an element are its
[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_box_elem_borders_ch7 primary="boxes"
secondary="element boxes" tertiary="borders"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_borders_ch7 primary="borders"
data-type="indexterm"}borders. The *border* of an element is just one or
more lines that surround the content and padding of an element. By
default, the []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077172832 primary="borders"
secondary="background and" data-type="indexterm"}background of the
element stops at the outer border edge, since the background does not
extend into the margins, and the border is just inside the margin, and
is thus drawn "underneath" the border. This matters when parts of the
border are transparent, such as with dashed borders.

Every border has three aspects: its width, or thickness; its style, or
appearance; and its color. []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077171232
primary="borders" secondary="width of" data-type="indexterm"}The default
value for the width of a border is `medium`, which was explicitly
declared to be 3 pixels wide in 2022. Despite this, the reason you don't
usually see borders is that the default style is `none`, which prevents
them from existing at all. (This lack of existence can also reset the
`border-width` value, but we'll get to that in a little while.)

Finally, the []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077151904

secondary="colors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077148992 primary="colors"
secondary="borders" data-type="indexterm"}default border color is
`currentcolor`, the foreground color of the element itself. If no color
has been declared for the border, it will be the same color as the text
of the element. If, on the other hand, an element has no text---let's
say it has a table that contains only images---the border color for that
table will be the text color of its parent element (because `color` is
inherited). Thus, if a table has a border, and the `<body>` is its
parent, given this rule

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {color: purple;}
```

then, by default, the border around the table will be purple (assuming
the user agent doesn't set a color for tables).

The CSS []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077130208 primary="borders"
secondary="intermittent" data-type="indexterm"}specification defines the
background area of an element to extend to the outside edge of the
border, at least by default. This is important because some borders are
*intermittent*---for example, `dotted` and `dashed` borders---so the
element's background should appear in the spaces between the visible
portions of the border.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_493}

Visible backgrounds can be prevented from extending into the border area
by using the property `background-clip`. See

details.

CSS defines 10 distinct styles for the property `border-style`,
including the default value of `none`.
[Figure 7-17](#ch07.xhtml_Borderstyles){data-type="xref"} demonstrates
these styles. This property is not inherited.

The style value `hidden` is equivalent to `none`, except when applied to
tables, where it has a slightly different effect on border-conflict
resolution.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Borderstyles" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0717.png" width="600" height="360"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_496"><span class="label">Figure 7-17.
</span>Border styles</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As for `double`, it's defined such that the width of the two lines it
creates, plus the width of the space between them, is equal to the value
of `border-width` (discussed in the next section). However, the CSS
specification doesn't say whether one of the lines should be thicker
than the other, or if they should always be the same width, or if the
space should be thicker or thinner than the lines. All of these options
are left up to the user agent to decide, and the author has no reliable
way to influence the final result.

All the borders shown in
[Figure 7-17](#ch07.xhtml_Borderstyles){data-type="xref"} are based on a
`color` value of `gray`, which makes all of the visual effects easier to
see. The look of a border style is always based in some way on the color
of the border, although the exact method may vary among user agents. The
way browsers treat colors in the border styles `inset`, `outset`,
`groove`, and `ridge` can and does vary. For example,
[Figure 7-18](#ch07.xhtml_Twovalidwaysofrenderinginset){data-type="xref"}
illustrates two ways a browser could render an inset
[border.]{.keep-together}

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Twovalidwaysofrenderinginset" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0718.png" width="600" height="53"
alt="css5 0718" />
<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_497"><span class="label">Figure 7-18.
</span>Two valid ways of rendering an inset</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this example, one browser takes the `gray` value for the bottom and
right sides, and a darker gray for the top and left; the other makes the
bottom and right lighter than `gray` and the top and left darker, but
not as dark as the first browser.

Now let's define a border style for images that are inside any unvisited
hyperlink. [We might]{.keep-together} make them `outset`, so they have a
"raised button" look, as depicted in
[Figure 7-19](#ch07.xhtml_Applyinganoutsetbordertoahyperlinkedimage){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link img {border-style: outset;}

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_498"><span class="label">Figure 7-19.
</span>Applying an outset border to a hyperlinked image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

By default, the []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077068720 primary="colors"
secondary="borders"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077067712 primary="colors"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077050576
primary="foreground colors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797077049904 primary="borders"
secondary="colors" data-type="indexterm"}color of the border is based on
the element's value for `color`, which in this circumstance is likely to
be `blue`. This is because the image is contained with a hyperlink, and
the foreground color of hyperlinks is usually `blue`. If you so desired,
you could change that color to silver, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link img {border-style: outset; color: silver;}
```

The border will now be based on the light-grayish `silver`, since that's
now the foreground color of the image---even though the image doesn't
actually use it, it's still passed on to the border. We'll talk about
another way to change border colors in ["Border
Colors"](#ch07.xhtml_border-colors){data-type="xref"}.

Remember, though, that the color-shifting in borders is up to the user
agent. Let's go back to the blue outset border and compare it in two
browsers, as shown in
[Figure 7-20](#ch07.xhtml_Twooutsetborders){data-type="xref"}.

Again, notice that one browser shifts the colors to the lighter and
darker, while another just shifts the "shadowed" sides to be darker than
blue. This is why, if a specific set of colors is desired, authors
usually set the exact colors they want instead of using a border style
like `outset` and leaving the result up to the browser. You'll soon see
just how to do that.

```

The result is a paragraph with a solid top border, a dashed right
border, a dotted bottom border, and a solid left border.

Again we see the TRBL order of values, just as we saw in our discussion
of setting `padding` with multiple values. All the same rules about
value replication apply to border styles, just as they did with padding.

Single-side border style properties are fairly self-explanatory. If you
want to change the style for the bottom border, for example, you use
`border-bottom-style`.

It's not uncommon to see `border` used in conjunction with a single-side
property. Suppose you want to set a solid border on three sides of a
heading, but not have a left border, as shown in

You can accomplish this in two ways, each one equivalent to the other:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-style: solid solid solid none;}
/* the above is the same as the below */
h1 {border-style: solid; border-left-style: none;}
```

What's important to remember is that if you're going to use the second
approach, you have to place the single-side property *after* the
shorthand, as is usually the case with shorthand. This is because
`border-style: solid` is actually a declaration of
`border-style: solid solid solid solid`. If you put
`border-style-left: none` before the `border-style` declaration, the
shorthand's value will override the single-side value of `none`.

###### Note {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_512}

As of early 2023, border widths *still* cannot be given percentage
values, which is rather a shame.
:::

There are four ways to assign width to a border: you can give it a
length value such as `4px` or `0.1em`, or use one of three keywords.
These keywords are `thin`, `medium` (the default value), and `thick`.
According to the specification, `thick` is 5px, wider than `medium`'s
3px, which is wider than the 1-px `thin`---which makes sense.

[Figure 7-24](#ch07.xhtml_Therelationofborder-widthkeywordstoeachother){data-type="xref"}
illustrates these three keywords, and how they relate to one another and
to the content they surround.

<figure class="bordernone">

</span>The relation of border-width keywords to each other</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Let's suppose a paragraph has a background color and a border style set:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-color: silver;
    border-style: solid;}
```

The border's width is, by default, `medium`. We can change that easily
enough:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-color: silver;
    border-style: solid; border-width: thick;}
```

Border widths can be taken to fairly ridiculous extremes, such as
setting 1,000-pixel borders, though this is rarely necessary (or
advisable). It is important to remember that [borders]{.keep-together},
and therefore `border-width` values, participate in the box model,
impacting an element's size.

It's possible to set widths for individual sides, using two familiar
methods. The first is to use any of the specific properties mentioned at
the beginning of the section, such as `border-bottom-width`.
[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797076559584 primary="values"
secondary="replicating in borders" data-type="indexterm"}The other way
is to use value replication in `border-width`, following the usual TRBL
pattern, which is illustrated in
[Figure 7-25](#ch07.xhtml_Valuereplicationandunevenborderwidths){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

### No border at all {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_518}

So far, we've talked only about using a visible border style such as
`solid` or `outset`. []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797076400560
primary="border-style property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797076399824 primary="borders"
secondary="none" data-type="indexterm"}Let's consider what happens when
you set `border-style` to `none`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {border-style: none; border-width: 20px;}
```

Even though the border's width is `20px`, the style is set to `none`. In
this case, not only does the border's style vanish, so does its width.
The border just ceases to be. Why?

As you may remember, the terminology used earlier in the chapter
indicated that a border with a style of `none` *does not exist*. Those
words were chosen very carefully, because they help explain what's going
on here. Since the border doesn't exist, it can't have any width, so the
width is automatically set to `0` (zero), no matter what you try to
define.

After all, if a drinking glass is empty, you can't really describe it as
being half-full of nothing. You can discuss the depth of a glass's
contents only if it has actual contents. In the same way, talking about
the width of a border makes sense only in the context of a border that
exists.

This is important to keep in mind because it's a common mistake to
forget to declare a border style. This leads to all kinds of developer
frustration because, at first glance, the styles appear correct. Given
the following rule, though, no `<h1>` element will have a border of any
kind, let alone one that's 20 pixels wide:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-width: 20px;}
```

Since the default value of `border-style` is `none`, failure to declare
a style is exactly the same as declaring `border-style: none`.
Therefore, if you want a border to appear, you need to declare a border
style.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797076319008 primary=""

If there are fewer than four values, value replication takes effect as
usual. So if you want `<h1>` elements to have thin gray top and bottom
borders with thick green side borders, and medium gray borders around
`<p>` elements, the following styles will suffice, with the result shown
in [Figure 7-26](#ch07.xhtml_Bordershavemanyaspects){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-style: solid; border-width: thin thick; border-color: gray green;}
p {border-style: solid; border-color: gray;}
```

A single `color` value will be applied to all four sides, as with the
paragraph in the previous example. On the other hand, if you supply four
color values, you can get a different color on each side. Any type of
color value can be used, from named colors to hexadecimal and HSL
values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {border-style: solid; border-width: thick;
    border-color: black hsl(0 0% 25% / 0.5) #808080 silver;}
```

If you don't declare a color, the default is `currentcolor`, which is
always the foreground color of the element. Thus, the following
declaration will be displayed as shown in
[Figure 7-27](#ch07.xhtml_Bordercolorsbasedontheelementsforegroundandthevalueoftheborder-colorproperty){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.shade1 {border-style: solid; border-width: thick; color: gray;}
p.shade2 {border-style: solid; border-width: thick; color: gray;
    border-color: black;}

The result is that the first paragraph has a gray border, having used
the foreground color of the paragraph. The second paragraph, however,
has a black border because that color was explicitly assigned using
`border-color`.

### Transparent borders {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_527}

As you may recall, if a border has []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797075896928
primary="borders" secondary="transparent"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797075895952
primary="transparent borders" data-type="indexterm"}no style, it has no
width. In some situations, however, you'll want to create an invisible
border that still has width. This is where the border color value
`transparent` comes in.

Let's say we want a set of three links to have borders that are
invisible by default, but look inset when the link is hovered. We can
accomplish this by making the borders transparent in the nonhovered
case:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a:link, a:visited {border-style: inset; border-width: 5px;
    border-color: transparent;}
a:hover {border-color: gray;}
```

This will have the effect shown in
[Figure 7-28](#ch07.xhtml_using_transparent_borders){data-type="xref"}.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797075832592
primary="" startref="ix_borders_colors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797075831712 primary=""
startref="ix_color_border" data-type="indexterm"}

In a sense, `transparent` lets you use borders as if they were extra
padding. Should you want to make them visible, the space is reserved,
preventing a reflow of content when visible borders are added in.

## Single-Side Shorthand Border Properties {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_529}

It turns out that []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_border_singleside_prop
primary="borders" secondary="single-side properties"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_border_shorthand_prop
primary="borders" secondary="shorthand properties for"
data-type="indexterm"}shorthand properties such as `border-color` and
`border-style` aren't always as helpful as you'd think. For example, you
might want to apply a thick, gray, solid border to all `<h1>` elements,
but only along the bottom. If you limit yourself to the properties we've
discussed so far, you'll have a hard time applying such a border. Here
are two examples:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-bottom-width: thick;  /* option #1 */
    border-bottom-style: solid;
    border-bottom-color: gray;}
h1 {border-width: 0 0 thick;    /* option #2 */
    border-style: none none solid;
    border-color: gray;}
```

Neither is really convenient, given all the typing involved.
Fortunately, a better solution is available:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-bottom: thick solid rgb(50% 40% 75%);}
```

This will apply the values to the bottom border alone, as shown in
[Figure 7-29](#ch07.xhtml_Settingabottomborderwithashorthandproperty){data-type="xref"},
leaving the others to their defaults. Since the default border style is
`none`, no borders appear on the other three sides of the element.

We can use these properties to create some complex borders, such as
those shown in
[Figure 7-30](#ch07.xhtml_Verycomplexborders){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-left: 3px solid gray;
    border-right: green 0.25em dotted;
    border-top: thick goldenrod inset;

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_532"><span class="label">Figure 7-30.
</span>Very complex borders</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As you can see, the order of the actual values doesn't really matter.
The following three rules will yield exactly the same border effect:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-bottom: 3px solid gray;}
h2 {border-bottom: solid gray 3px;}
h3 {border-bottom: 3px gray solid;}
```

You can also leave out some values and let their defaults kick in, like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h3 {color: gray; border-bottom: 3px solid;}
```

Since no border color is declared, the default value (`currentcolor`) is
applied instead. Just remember that if you leave out a border style, the
default value of `none` will prevent your border from existing.

By contrast, if you set only a style, you will still get a border. Let's
say you want a top border style of `dashed` and you're willing to let
the width default to `medium` and the color be the same as the text of
the element itself. All you need in such a case is the following markup
(shown in
[Figure 7-31](#ch07.xhtml_Dashingacrossthetopofanelement){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.roof {border-top: dashed;}
```

</span>Dashing across the top of an element</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Also note that since each of these border-side properties applies only
to a specific side, there isn't any possibility of value
replication---it wouldn't make any sense. There can be only one of each
type of value: that is, only one width value, only one color value, and
only one border style. So don't try to declare more than one value type:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h3 {border-top: thin thick solid purple;} /* two width values--WRONG */
```

This property has the advantage of being very compact, although that
brevity introduces a few limitations. Before we worry about that, let's
see how `border` works. If you want all `<h1>` elements to have a thick
silver border, the following declaration would display as shown in
[Figure 7-32](#ch07.xhtml_Areallyshortborderdeclaration){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border: thick silver solid;}
```

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_536"><span class="label">Figure 7-32.
</span>A really short border declaration</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The drawback with `border` is that you can define only a single global
style, width, and color. The values you supply for `border` will apply
to all four sides equally. If you want the borders to be different for a
single side, use some of the other border properties. Then again, it's
possible to turn the cascade to your advantage:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border: thick goldenrod solid;
    border-left-width: 20px;}
```

The second rule overrides the width value for the left border assigned
by the first rule, thus replacing `thick` with `20px`, as you can see in
[Figure 7-33](#ch07.xhtml_Usingthecascadetoonesadvantage){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">

</span>Using the cascade to your advantage</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You still need to take the usual precautions with shorthand properties:
if you omit a value, the default will be filled in automatically. This
can have unintended effects. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h4 {border: medium green;}
```

Here, we've failed to assign a `border-style`, which means that the
default value of `none` will be used, and thus no `<h4>` elements will
have any border at all.

## Borders and Inline Elements {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_538}

Dealing with []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_inline_format_borders
primary="inline formatting" secondary="borders"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_border_inline_elem
primary="borders" secondary="inline elements"
data-type="indexterm"}borders and inline elements should sound pretty
familiar, since the rules are largely the same as those that cover
padding and inline elements, as we discussed earlier. Still, we'll
briefly touch on the topic again.

First, no matter how thick you make your borders on inline elements, the
line height of the element won't change. Let's set block-start and
block-end borders on boldfaced text:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {border-block-start: 10px solid hsl(216,50%,50%);
        border-block-end: 5px solid #AEA010;}
```

As seen before, adding borders to the block start and end will have
absolutely no effect on the line height. However, since borders are
visible, they'll be drawn---as illustrated in
[Figure 7-34](#ch07.xhtml_Bordersoninlinenonreplacedelements){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Bordersoninlinenonreplacedelements" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_539"><span class="label">Figure 7-34.
</span>Borders on inline nonreplaced elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The borders have to go somewhere. That's where they went. They get
painted over the preceding line of text and under the next line of text
if need be.

Again, all of this is true only for the block-start and -end sides of
inline elements; the inline sides are a different story. If you apply a
border along an inline side, not only will they be visible, but they'll
displace the text around them, as you can see in
[Figure 7-35](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwithaleftborder){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {border-inline-start: 25px double hsl(216 50% 50%); background: silver;}
```

</span>Inline nonreplaced elements with inline-start borders</h6>
</div>
</figure>

With borders, just as with padding, the browser's calculations for line
breaking are not directly affected by any box properties set for inline
nonreplaced elements. The only effect is that the space taken up by the
borders may shift portions of the line over a bit, which may in turn
change which word is at the end of the line.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_541}

The way borders are (or aren't) drawn at the ends of each line box can
be altered with the property `box-decoration-break`. See

With []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797075237536 primary="replaced elements"

with padding: a border *will* affect the height of the lines of text, in

following styles, we get a result like that seen in

The radius of a rounded border corner is the radius of a circle or
ellipse, one-quarter of which is used to define the path of the border's
rounding. We'll start with circles, because they're a little easier to
understand.

Suppose we want to round the corner of an element so that each corner is
pretty obviously rounded. Here's one way to do that:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius: 2em;}
```

That will have the result shown in
[Figure 7-37](#ch07.xhtml_Howborderradiiarecalculated){data-type="xref"},
where circle diagrams have been added to two of the corners. (The same
rounding is done in all four corners.)

<figure>

</span>How border radii are calculated</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Focus on the top-left corner. There, the border begins to curve 2 em
below the top of the border, and 2 em to the right of the left side of
the border. The curve follows along the outside of the 2-em-radius
circle.

If we were to draw a box that contained just the part of the top-left
corner that is curved, that box would be 2 em wide and 2 em tall. The
same would happen in the bottom- [right corner.]{.keep-together}

With single length values, we get circular corner-rounding shapes. If a
single percentage is used, the results are far more oval. For example,
consider the following, illustrated in
[Figure 7-38](#ch07.xhtml_Howpercentageborderradiiarecalculated){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius: 33%;}
```

</span>How percentage border radii are calculated</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Again, let's focus on the top-left corner. On the left edge, the border
curve begins at the point 33% of the element box's height down from the
top. In other words, if the element box is 100 pixels tall from the top
border edge to the bottom border edge, the curve begins 33 pixels from
the top of the element box.

Similarly, on the top edge, the curve begins at the point 33% of the
element box's width from the left edge. So if the box is (say) 600
pixels wide, the curve begins 198 pixels from the left edge, because 600
× 0.33 = 198.

The shape of the curve between those two points is identical to the
top-left edge of an ellipse whose horizontal radius is 198 pixels long,
and whose vertical radius is 33 [pixels]{.keep-together} long. (This is
the same as an ellipse with a horizontal axis of 396 pixels and a
vertical axis of 66 pixels.)

The same thing is done in each corner, leading to a set of corner shapes
that mirror each other, rather than being identical.

Supplying a single length or percentage value for `border-radius` means
all four corners will have the same rounding shape. As you may have
spotted in the syntax definition, you can supply `border-radius` with up
to four values. Because `border-radius` is a physical property, the
values go in clockwise order from top left to bottom left, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius:
     1em  /* Top Left */
     2em  /* Top Right */
     3em  /* Bottom Right */
     4em; /* Bottom Left */
}
```

This TL-TR-BR-BL can be remembered with the mnemonic "TiLTeR BuRBLe," if
you're inclined to such things. The important thing is that the rounding
starts in the top left and works its way clockwise from there.

If a value is omitted, the missing values are filled in using a pattern
like that used for `padding`, and so on. If there are three values, the
fourth is copied from the second. If there are two, the third is copied
from the first, and the fourth from the second. If there's just one, the
missing three are copied from the first. Thus, the following two rules
are identical and will have the result shown in
[Figure 7-39](#ch07.xhtml_Avarietyofroundedcorners){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

There's an important aspect to
[Figure 7-39](#ch07.xhtml_Avarietyofroundedcorners){data-type="xref"}:
the rounding of the content area's background along with the rest of the
background. See how the silver curves, and the period sits outside it?
That's the expected behavior when the content area's background is
different from the padding background (you'll see how to do that in
[Chapter 8](../Text/ch08.xhtml#backgrounds){data-type="xref"}) and the
curving of a corner is large enough to affect the boundary between
content and padding.

This is because while `border-radius` changes the way the border and
background(s) of an element are drawn, it does *not* change the shape of
the element box. Consider the situation depicted in
[Figure 7-40](#ch07.xhtml_Elementswithroundedcornersarestillboxes){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Elementswithroundedcornersarestillboxes"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_548"><span class="label">Figure 7-40.
</span>Elements with rounded corners are still boxes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Here, we have an element that's been floated to the left, and other text
flowing past it. The border corners are completely round, using
`border-radius: 50%` on a square element. Some of its text is sticking
out past the rounded corners. Beyond the rounded corners, the page
background is visible where the corners *would* have been, were they not
rounded.

So at a glance, you might assume that the element has been reshaped from
box to circle (technically to ellipse), and the text just happens to
stick out of it. But look at the text flowing past the float. It doesn't
flow into the area the rounded corners "left behind." That's because the
corners of the floated element are still there. They're just not visibly
filled by border and background, thanks to `border-radius`.

### More complex corner shaping {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_550}

Now that you've seen how assigning a single radius value to a corner
shapes it, let's talk about what happens when corners get two
values---and, more importantly, how they get those values.

For example, suppose we want corners to be rounded by 3 character units
horizontally, and 1 character unit vertically. We can't just use
`border-radius: 3ch 1ch` because that will round the top-left and
bottom-right corners by `3ch`, and the other two corners by `1ch` each.
Inserting a forward slash will get us what we're after:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius: 3ch / 1ch;}
```

This is functionally equivalent to saying the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius: 3ch 3ch 3ch 3ch / 1ch 1ch 1ch 1ch;}
```

The way this syntax works, the horizontal radius of each corner's
rounding ellipse is given, and then after the slash, the vertical radius
of each corner is given. In both cases, the values are in TiLTeR BuRBLe
order.

Here's a simpler example, illustrated in
[Figure 7-41](#ch07.xhtml_Ellipticalcornerrounding){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius: 1em / 2em;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Ellipticalcornerrounding" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0741.png" width="600" height="229"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_551"><span class="label">Figure 7-41.
</span>Elliptical corner rounding</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Each corner is rounded by 1 em along the horizontal axis, and 2 em along
the vertical axis, in the manner you saw in detail in the previous
section.

Here's a slightly more complex version, providing two lengths to either
side of the slash, as depicted in
[Figure 7-42](#ch07.xhtml_Differentellipticalroundingcalculations){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius: 2.5em 2em / 1.5em 3em;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Differentellipticalroundingcalculations"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0742.png" width="600" height="263"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_552"><span class="label">Figure 7-42.
</span>Different elliptical rounding calculations</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners are curved 2.5 em
along the horizontal axis, and 1.5 em along the vertical axis. The
top-right and bottom-left corners, on the other hand, are curved 2 em
along the horizontal and 3 along the vertical.

Remember, you use horizontal values before the slash, and vertical
after. If we'd wanted to make the top-left and bottom-right corners
rounded 1 em horizontally and 1 em vertically (a circular rounding), the
values would have been written like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius: 1em 2em / 1em 3em;}
```

Percentages are also fair game here. If we want to round the corners of
an element so that the sides are fully rounded but extend only 2
character units into the element horizontally, we'd write it like
so:[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797074834880 primary=""

So far, the []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797074784048 primary="borders"
secondary="corner blending"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797074783040 primary="corners"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797074782096
primary="blending" secondary="border corners"
data-type="indexterm"}corners we've rounded have been pretty
simple---always the same width, style, and color. That won't always be
the case, though. What happens if a thick, red, solid border is rounded
into a thin, dashed green border?

The specification directs that the rounding cause as smooth a blend as
possible when it comes to the width. When rounding from a thicker border
to a thinner border, the width of the border should gradually shrink
throughout the curve of the rounded corner.

When it comes to differing styles and colors, the specification is less
clear about how this should be accomplished. Consider the various
samples shown in
[Figure 7-43](#ch07.xhtml_Roundedcornersupclose){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Roundedcornersupclose" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0743.png" width="600" height="69"
alt="css5 0743" />
<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_554"><span class="label">Figure 7-43.
</span>Rounded corners up close</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The first is a simple rounded corner, with no variation in color, width,
or style. The second shows rounding from one thickness to another. You
can visualize this second case as defining a circular shape on the outer
edge and an elliptical shape on the inner edge.

In the third case, the color and thickness stay the same, but the corner
curves from a solid style on the left to a double-line style on top. The
transition between styles is abrupt and occurs at the halfway point in
the curve.

The fourth example shows a transition from a thick solid to a thinner
double border. []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797074776176 primary="transitions"
secondary="border corner rounding" data-type="indexterm"}Note the
placement of the transition, which is *not* at the halfway point. It is
instead determined by taking the ratio of the two borders' thicknesses
and using that to find the transition point. Let's assume the left
border is 10 pixels thick, and the top border 5 pixels thick. By summing
the two to get 15 pixels, the left border gets 2/3 (10/15), and the top
border 1/3 (5/15). Thus, the left border's style is used in two-thirds
of the curve, and the top border's style in one-third the curve. The
width is still smoothly changed over the length of the curve.

The fifth and sixth examples show what happens with color added to the
mix. Effectively, the color stays linked to the style. This hard
transition between colors is common behavior among browsers as of late
2022, but it may not always be so. The specification explicitly states
that user agents *may* blend from one border color to another by using a
linear gradient. Perhaps one day they will, but for now, the changeover
is sharp.

The seventh example in
[Figure 7-43](#ch07.xhtml_Roundedcornersupclose){data-type="xref"} shows
a case we haven't really discussed: "What happens if the borders are
equal to or thicker than the value of `border-radius`?" In this case,
the outside of the corner is rounded, but the inside is not, as shown.
This would occur with code like the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-style: solid;
     border-color: tan red;
     border-width: 20px;
     border-radius: 20px;}

Each property sets the curve shape for its corner and doesn't affect the
others. The fun part is that if you supply two values, one for the
horizontal radius and one for the vertical radius, there is *no* slash
separating them. Really. This means that the following two rules are
functionally equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {border-radius:
     1.5em 2vw 20% 0.67ch / 2rem 1.2vmin 1cm 10%;
     }
#example {
     border-top-left-radius: 1.5em 2rem;
     border-top-right-radius: 2vw 1.2vmin;
     border-bottom-right-radius: 20% 1cm;
     border-bottom-left-radius: 0.67ch 10%;
}
```

The individual corner border radius properties are mostly useful for
setting a common corner rounding and then overriding just one. Thus, a
comic-book-like word balloon shape could be done as follows, with the
result shown in

You might be thinking, "Hold on, that's not what the other logical
properties looked like!" And that's true: these are a fair bit
different. That's because if we had a property like
`border-block-start-radius`, it would apply to both corners along the
block-start edge. But if you also had `border-inline-start-radius`, it
would apply to both corners on the inline-start edge, one of which is
also on the block-start edge.

So the way the logical border radius properties work is they're labeled
in the pattern *border-block-inline-radius*. Thus,
`border-start-end-radius` sets the radius of the corner that's at the
junction of the block-start and inline-end edges. Take the following
example, which is illustrated in
[Figure 7-45](#ch07.xhtml_logical-border-radius){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {border-start-end-radius: 2em;}

Remember that you can use the same space-separated value pattern for
defining an elliptical corner radius, as shown earlier in the section
for `border-top-left-radius` and friends. However, the value is still in
the pattern of horizontal radius, then vertical radius, instead of being
relative to the block and inline flow directions. This seems like a bit
of an oversight in CSS, but it is how things are as of late 2022.

One thing to keep in mind is that, as you've seen, corner shaping
affects the background and (potentially) the padding and content areas
of the element, but not any image borders. Wait a minute, image borders?

</span>Defining a border image’s source</h6>
</div>
</figure>

There are a few points to note here. First, without the
`border: 25px solid` declaration, there would have been no border at
all. Remember, if the value of `border-style` is `none`, the width of
the border is 0. So to make a border image appear, you need to have a
border, which means declaring a `border-style` value other than `none`
or `hidden`. It doesn't have to be `solid`. Second, the value of
`border-width` determines the actual width of the border images. Without
a declared value, it will default to `medium`, which is 3 pixels. If the
border image fails to load, the border is the `border-color` value.

OK, so we set up a []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_image_border_slice
primary="image borders" secondary="slicing"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_border_image_slice_prop
primary="border-image-slice property" data-type="indexterm"}border area
25 pixels wide and then applied an image to it. That gave us the same
circle in each of the four corners. But why did it appear only there and
not along the sides? The answer is found in the way the physical
property `border-image-slice` is defined.

What `border-image-slice` does is establish a set of four slice-lines
that are laid over the image, and where they fall determines how the
image will be sliced up for use in an image border. The property takes
up to four values, defining (in order) offsets from the top, right,
bottom, and left edges. Yep, there's that TRBL pattern again, which pegs
`border-image-slice` as a physical property. And value replication is
also in effect here, so a single value will be used for all four
offsets.
[Figure 7-47](#ch07.xhtml_Variousslicingpatterns){data-type="xref"}
shows a small sampling of offset patterns, all based on percentages.

As of late 2022, no logical-property equivalent exists for
`border-image-slice`. If the proposed `logical` keyword, or something
equivalent, is ever adopted and implemented, using `border-image-slice`
in a writing-flow-relative fashion will be possible. There are also no
single-side properties; that is, there is no such thing as
`border-left-image-slice`.

Now let's take an image that has a 3 × 3 grid of circles, each a
different color, and slice it up for use in an image border.
[Figure 7-48](#ch07.xhtml_Anall-aroundimageborder){data-type="xref"}
shows a single copy of this image and the resulting image border:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 25px solid;
border-image-source: url(i/circles.png);
border-image-slice: 33.33%;
```

Yikes! That's...interesting. The stretchiness of the sides is the
default behavior, and it makes a fair amount of sense, as you'll see
(and find out how to change) in ["Altering the repeat
pattern"](#ch07.xhtml_altering-the-repeat-pattern){data-type="xref"}.
Beyond that effect, you can see in
[Figure 7-48](#ch07.xhtml_Anall-aroundimageborder){data-type="xref"}
that the slice-lines fall right between the circles, because the circles
are all the same size and so one-third offsets place the slice-lines
right between them. The corner circles go into the corners of the
border, and each side's circle is stretched out to fill its side.

("Wait, what happened to the gray circle in the middle?" you may wonder.
It's an interesting question! For now, just accept it as one of life's
little mysteries, albeit a mystery that will be explained later in this
section.)

All right, so why did our first border image example, back at the
beginning of the section, place images only in the corners of the border
area instead of all the way around it?

Anytime the slice-lines meet or go past each other, the corner images
are created but the side images are made empty. This is easiest to
visualize with `border-image-slice: 50%`. In that case, the image is
sliced into four quadrants, one for each corner, with nothing remaining
for the sides.

However, any value *above* `50%` has the same basic result, even though
the image isn't sliced into neat quadrants anymore. Thus, for
`border-image-slice: 100%`---which is the default value---each corner
gets the entire image, and the sides are left empty. A few examples of
this effect are shown in
[Figure 7-49](#ch07.xhtml_Variouspatternsthatpreventsideslices){data-type="xref"}.

That's why we had to have a 3 × 3 grid of circles when we wanted to go
all the way around the border area, corners, and sides.

In addition to using percentage offsets, we also can define the offsets
by using a number. Not a length, as you might assume, but a bare number.
In raster images like PNGs or JPEGs, the number corresponds to pixels in
the image on a 1:1 basis. If you have a raster image and want to define
25-pixel offsets for the slice-lines, this is how to do that, as
illustrated in
[Figure 7-50](#ch07.xhtml_Numberslicing){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 25px solid;
border-image-source: url(i/circles.png);
border-image-slice: 25;
```

</span>Number slicing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Yikes again! What happened there is that the raster image is 150 × 150
pixels, so each circle is 50 × 50 pixels. Our offsets, though, were only
`25`, as in 25 pixels. So the slice-lines were placed on the image as
shown in
[Figure 7-51](#ch07.xhtml_Slicelinesat25pixels){data-type="xref"}.

This begins to give us an idea of why the default behavior for the side
images is to stretch them. Note how the corners flow into the sides,
visually speaking.

If you change the image to one that has a different size, numeric
offsets don't adapt to the new size, whereas percentages do. The
interesting thing about number offsets is that they work just as well on
nonraster images, like SVGs, as they do on rasters. So do percentages.
In general, it's probably best to use percentages for your slicing
offsets whenever possible, even if that means doing a little math to get
exactly the right percentages.

Now let's address the curious case of the image's center. In the
previous examples, a circle is at the center of the 3 × 3 grid of
circles, but it disappears when the image is applied to the border. In
the preceding example, in fact, not only the middle circle was missing,
but the entire center slice. This dropping of the center slice is the
default behavior for image slicing, but you can override it by adding a
`fill` keyword to the end of your `border-image-slice` value. If we add
`fill` to the previous example, as shown here, we'll get the result
shown in [Figure 7-52](#ch07.xhtml_Usingthefillslice){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 25px solid;
border-image-source: url(i/circles.png);
border-image-slice: 25 fill;
```

There's the center slice, filling up the element's background area. In
fact, it's drawn over the top of whatever background the element might
have, including any background images or color, so you can use it as a
substitute for the background or as an addition to it.

You may have noticed that all our border areas have been a consistent
width (usually `25px`). This doesn't have to be the case, regardless of
how the border image is actually sliced up. Suppose we take the circles
border image we've been using, slice it by thirds as we have, but make
the border widths different:[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797074302608 primary=""
startref="ix_border_image_slice_prop"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797074301664 primary=""

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-style: solid;
border-width: 20px 40px 60px 80px;
border-image-source: url(i/circles.png);
border-image-slice: 50;
```

This would have a result like that shown in
[Figure 7-53](#ch07.xhtml_Unevenborderimagewidths){data-type="xref"}.
Even though the slice-lines are intrinsically set to 50 pixels (via
`50`), the resulting slices are resized to fit into the border areas
they occupy.

borders have depended on a `border-width` value to set the sizes of the
border areas, which the border images have filled out precisely. That
is, if the top border side is 25 pixels tall, the border image that
fills it will be 25 pixels tall. If you want to make the images a
different size than the area defined by `border-width`, you can use the
physical property `border-image-width`.

```
The basic fact to understand about `border-image-width` is that it's
very similar to `border-image-slice`, except that `border-image-width`
slices up the border box itself.

To understand what this means, let's start with length values. We'll set
up 1-em border widths like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-image-width: 1em;
```

That pushes slice-lines 1 em inward from each of the border area's
sides, as shown in
[Figure 7-54](#ch07.xhtml_Placingslice-linesfortheborderimageswidth){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Placingslice-linesfortheborderimageswidth"
class="figure">

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_575"><span class="label">Figure 7-54.
</span>Placing slice-lines for the border image’s width</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So the top and bottom border areas are 1 em tall, the right and left
border areas are 1 em wide, and each corner is 1 em tall and wide. Given
that, the border images created with `border-image-slice` are filled
into those border areas in the manner prescribed by
`border-image-repeat` (which we'll get to shortly). Therefore, in
[Figure 7-55](#ch07.xhtml_css5_border_images-with-and-without){data-type="xref"},
we could have had a `border-width` of 0 and still made the border images
show up, by using `border-image-width`. This is useful if you want to
have a solid border as a fallback in case the border image doesn't load,
but don't want to make it as thick as the image border would be. You
could use something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 2px solid;
border-image-source: url(stars.gif);
border-image-width: 12px;
border-image-slice: 33.3333%;
padding: 12px;
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_css5_border_images-with-and-without" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0755.png" width="600" height="122"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_576"><span class="label">Figure 7-55.
</span>A border with and without its border image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This allows for a 12-pixel star border to be replaced with a 2-pixel
solid border if border images aren't available. Remember that if the
image border *does* load, you'll need to leave enough space for it to
show up without overlapping the content (by default, that is). You'll
see how to mitigate this problem in the next section.

Now that we've established how the width slice-lines are placed, the way
percentage values are handled should make sense, as long as you keep in
mind that the offsets are with respect to the overall border box, *not*
each border side. For example, consider the following declaration,
illustrated in
[Figure 7-56](#ch07.xhtml_Placementofpercentageslice-lines){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-image-width: 33%;
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Placementofpercentageslice-lines" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0756.png" width="600" height="289"

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_577"><span class="label">Figure 7-56.
</span>Placement of percentage slice-lines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As with length units, the lines are offset from their respective sides
of the border box. The distance they travel is with respect to the
border box. A common mistake is to assume that a percentage value is
with respect to the border area defined by `border-width`; that is,
given a `border-width` value of `30px`, the result of
`border-image-width: 33.333%;` will be 10 pixels. But no! It's one-third
the overall border box along that axis.

One way in which the behavior of `border-image-width` differs from
`border-image-slice` is in how it handles slices passing each other,
such as in this situation:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-image-width: 75%;
```

As you may recall, for `border-image-slice`, if the slices pass each
other, then the side areas (top, right, bottom, and/or left) are made
empty. With `border-image-width`, the values are proportionally reduced
until they no longer pass each other. So, given the preceding value of
`75%`, the browser will treat that as if it were `50%`. Similarly, the
following two declarations will have equivalent results:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-image-width: 25% 80% 25% 40%;
border-image-width: 25% 66.6667% 25% 33.3333%;
```

Note that in both declarations, the right offset is twice the left
value. That's what is meant by proportionally reducing the values until
they don't overlap: in other words, until they no longer add up to more
than 100%. The same would be done with top and bottom, were they to
overlap.

When it comes to number values for `border-image-width`, things get even
more interesting. If you set `border-image-width: 1`, the border image
areas will be determined by the value of `border-width`. That's the
default behavior. Thus, the following two declarations will have the
same result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-width: 1em 2em; border-image-width: 1em 2em;
border-width: 1em 2em; border-image-width: 1;
```

You can increase or reduce the number values to get a certain multiple
of the border area that `border-width` defines.
[Figure 7-57](#ch07.xhtml_Variousnumericborderimagewidths){data-type="xref"}
shows a few examples.

In each case, the number has been multiplied by the border area's width
or height, and the resulting value indicates the inward distance that
the offset is placed from the relevant side. Thus, for an element that
has `border-top-width` set to 3 pixels, `border-image-width: 10` will
create a 30-pixel offset from the top of the element. Change
`border-image-width` to `0.333`, and the top offset will be a lone
pixel.

</span>Various numeric border image widths</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The last value, `auto`, is interesting in that its resulting values
depend on the state of two other properties. If `border-image-source`
has been explicitly defined by the author, `border-image-width: auto`
uses the values that result from `border-image-slice`. Otherwise, it
uses the values that result from `border-width`. These two declarations
will have the same result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-width: 1em 2em; border-image-width: auto;
border-image-slice: 1em 2em; border-image-width: auto;
```

Note that you can mix up the value types for `border-image-width`. The
following are all valid, and would be quite interesting to try out in
live web pages:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-image-width: auto 10px;
border-image-width: 5 15% auto;
border-image-width: 0.42em 13% 3.14 auto;

Regardless of whether you use a length or a number,
`border-image-outset` pushes the border image area outward, beyond the
border box, in a manner similar to the way slice-lines are offset. The
difference is that here, the offsets are outward, not inward. Just as
with `border-image-width`, number values for `border-image-outset` are a
multiple of the width defined by `border-width`---*not*
`border-image-width`.

To see how this could be helpful, imagine that we want to use a border
image but have a fallback of a thin solid border if the image isn't
available. We might start out like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 2px solid;
padding: 0.5em;
border-image-slice: 10;
border-image-width: 1;
```

In this case, we have half an em of padding; at default browser
settings, that will be about 8 pixels. That plus the 2-pixel solid
border make a distance of 10 pixels from the content edge to the outer
border edge. So if the border image is available and rendered, it will
fill not only the border area, but also the padding, bringing it right
up against the content.

We could increase the padding to account for this, but then if the image
*doesn't* appear, we'll have a lot of excess padding between the content
and the thin solid border. Instead, let's push the border image outward,
like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 2px solid;
padding: 0.5em;
border-image-slice: 10;
border-image-width: 1;
border-image-outset: 8px;
```

This is illustrated in
[Figure 7-58](#ch07.xhtml_Creatinganimageborderoverhang){data-type="xref"},
and is compared to having no outset nor border image.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Creatinganimageborderoverhang" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_583"><span class="label">Figure 7-58.
</span>Creating an image border overhang</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first case, the image border has been pushed out far enough that
rather than overlapping the padding area, the images actually overlap
the margin area! We can also split the difference so that the image
border is roughly centered on the border area, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 2px solid;
padding: 0.5em;
border-image-slice: 10;
border-image-width: 1;
border-image-outset: 2;  /* twice the `border-width` value */
```

What you have to watch out for is pulling the image border too far
outward, to the point that it overlaps other content or gets clipped off
by the edges of the browser window (or both). If it does so, the image
border will be painted between the previous element's content and
background, hiding the background, but will be partially obscured if
subsequent content has a background or
border.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073736784 primary=""

###### Note {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_586}

As with the previous border image properties, no logical-property
equivalent exists for `border-image-repeat` as of late 2022.
:::

Let's see these values in action and then discuss each in turn. You've
already seen `stretch`, so the effect is familiar. Each side gets a
single image, stretched to match the height and width of the border side
area the image is filling.

The `repeat` value tiles the image until it fills up all the space in
its border side area. The exact arrangement is to center the image in
its side box, and then tile copies of the image outward from that point,
until the border side area is filled. This can lead to some of the
repeated images being clipped at the sides of the border area, as seen
in
[Figure 7-59](#ch07.xhtml_Variousimagerepeatpatterns){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Variousimagerepeatpatterns" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_587"><span class="label">Figure 7-59.
</span>Various image-repeat patterns</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The `round` value is a little different. With this value, the browser
divides the length of the border side area by the size of the image
being repeated inside it. It then rounds to the nearest whole number and
repeats that number of images. In addition, it stretches or squashes the
images so that they just touch each other as they repeat.

As an example, suppose the top border side area is 420 pixels wide, and
the image being tiled is 50 pixels wide. Dividing 420 by 50 results in
8.4, so that's rounded to 8. Thus, eight images are tiled. However, each
is stretched to be 52.5 pixels wide (420 ÷ 8 = 52.5). Similarly, if the
right border side area is 280 pixels tall, a 50-pixel-tall image will be
tiled six times (280 ÷ 50 = 5.6, rounded to 6) and each image will be
squashed to 46.6667 pixels tall (280 ÷ 6 = 46.6667). If you look closely
at
[Figure 7-59](#ch07.xhtml_Variousimagerepeatpatterns){data-type="xref"},
you can see the top and bottom circles are stretched a bit, whereas the
right and left circles show some squashing. The last value, `space`,
starts out similar to `round`, in that the border side area's length is
divided by the size of the tiled image and then rounded. The differences
are that the resulting number is always rounded *down*, and images are
not distorted but instead distributed evenly throughout the border
area.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073680656 primary=""
startref="ix_border_image_repeat_prop"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073679616 primary=""
startref="ix_image_border_repeat"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073678672 primary=""
startref="ix_repeat_image_border" data-type="indexterm"}

Thus, given a top border side area 420 pixels wide and a 50-pixel-wide
image to be tiled, there will still be 8 images to repeat (8.4 rounded
down is 8). The images will take up 400 pixels of space, leaving 20
pixels. That 20 pixels is divided by 8, which is 2.5 pixels. Half of
that is put to each side of each image, meaning each image gets 1.25
pixels of space to either side. That puts 2.5 pixels of space between
each image, and 1.25 pixels of space before the first and after the last
image (see
[Figure 7-60](#ch07.xhtml_Avarietyofspacerepetitions){data-type="xref"}
for examples of `space` repeating).

secondary="forward slash" data-type="indexterm"}property value has, it
must be admitted, a somewhat unusual syntax. To get all the various
properties for slices and widths and offsets, *and* be able to tell
which is which, the decision was made to separate them by forward-slash
symbols (`/`) and require them to be listed in a specific order: slice,
then width, then offset. The image source and repeat values can go
anywhere outside of that three-value chain. Therefore, the following
rules are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.example {
    border-image-source: url(eagles.png);
    border-image-slice: 40% 30% 20% fill;
    border-image-width: 10px 7px;
    border-image-outset: 5px;
    border-image-repeat: space;
}
.example {border-image: url(eagles.png) 40% 30% 20% fill / 10px 7px / 5px space;}
.example {border-image: url(eagles.png) space 40% 30% 20% fill / 10px 7px / 5px;}
.example {border-image: space 40% 30% 20% fill / 10px 7px / 5px url(eagles.png);}
```

The shorthand clearly means less typing, but also less clarity at a
glance.

As is usually the case with shorthand properties, leaving out any of the
individual pieces means that the defaults will be supplied. For example,
if we supply just an image source, the rest of the properties will be
set to their default values. Thus, the following two declarations will
have exactly the same effect:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border-image: url(orbit.svg);
border-image: url(orbit.svg) stretch 100% / 1 / 0;

### Some examples {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_591}

Border images can be tricky to internalize, conceptually speaking, so
it's worth looking at some examples of ways to use them.

First, let's set up a border with scooped-out corners and a raised
appearance, like a plaque, with a fallback to a simple outset border of
similar colors. We might use something like these styles and an image,
which is shown in
[Figure 7-61](#ch07.xhtml_border-ex-01){data-type="xref"}, along with
both the final result and the fallback result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#plaque {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 3px outset goldenrod;
    background: goldenrod;
    border-image-source: url(i/plaque.png);
    border-image-repeat: stretch;
    border-image-slice: 20 fill;
    border-image-width: 12px;
    border-image-outset: 9px;
}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_border-ex-01" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0761.png" width="600" height="112"
alt="css5 0761" />
<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_592"><span class="label">Figure 7-61.
</span>A simple plaque effect and its older-browser fallback</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the side slices are perfectly set up to be
stretched---everything about them is just repeated strips of color along
the axis of stretching. They could also be repeated or rounded in this
instance, but stretching works just fine. And since [that's
the]{.keep-together} default value, we could have omitted the
`border-image-repeat` declaration altogether.

Next, let's try to create something oceanic: an image border that has
waves marching all the way around. Since we don't know how wide or tall
the element will be ahead of time, and we want the waves to flow from
one to another, we'll use `round` to take advantage of its scaling
behavior while getting in as many waves as will reasonably fit. You can
see the result in
[Figure 7-62](#ch07.xhtml_wavy-border){data-type="xref"}, along with the
image that's used to create the effect:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#oceanic {
    border: 2px solid blue;
    border-image:
        url(waves.png) 50 fill / 20px / 10px round;
}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_wavy-border" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0762.png" width="600" height="189"
alt="css5 0762" />
<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_593"><span class="label">Figure 7-62.
</span>A wavy border</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You should be wary of one issue here, which is what happens if you add
in an element background. Just to make the situation clear, we'll add a
red background to this element, with the result shown in
[Figure 7-63](#ch07.xhtml_border-ex-03){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#oceanic {
    background: red;
    border: 2px solid blue;
    border-image:
        url(waves.png) 50 fill / 20px / 10px round;
}
```

See how the background color is visible between the waves? That's
because the wave image is a PNG with transparent bits, and the
combination of image-slice widths and outset enable some of the
background area to be visible through the transparent parts of the
border. This can be a problem, because in some cases you'll want to use
a background color in addition to an image border---for the fallback
case where the image fails to appear, if nothing else. Generally, this
is a problem best addressed by either not needing a background for the
fallback case, using `border-image-outset` to pull the image out far
enough that no part of the background area is visible, or using
`background-clip: padding-box` (see ["Clipping the
Background"](../Text/ch08.xhtml#clipping-the-background){data-type="xref"}).[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073329184

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073327296 primary=""
startref="ix_image_border_ch7" data-type="indexterm"}

As you can see, border images have a lot of power. Be sure to use them
wisely.

primary="visual formatting" secondary="outlines"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_box_elem_outline primary="boxes"
secondary="element boxes" tertiary="outlines"
data-type="indexterm"}element decoration called an *outline*. In
practice, outlines are often drawn just beyond the borders, though (as
you'll see) this is not the whole story. As the specification puts it,
outlines differ from borders in three basic ways:

-   Outlines are visible but do not take up layout space.

-   User agents often render outlines on elements in the `:focus` state,
    precisely because they do not take up layout space and so do not
    change the layout.

-   Outlines may be nonrectangular.

To these, we'll add a fourth:

-   Outlines are an all-or-nothing proposition: you can't style one side
    of a border independently from the others.

Let's start finding out exactly what all that means. First, we'll run
through the various properties, comparing them to their border-related
counterparts.

`border-style`, you can set a style for your outlines. In fact, the
values will seem familiar to anyone who's styled a border before.

:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
The two major differences are that outlines cannot have a `hidden`
style, as borders can; and outlines can have the `auto` style. This
style allows the user agent to get extra-fancy with the appearance of
the outline, as explained in the CSS specification:

> The `auto` value permits the user agent to render a custom outline
> style, typically a style which is either a user interface default for
> the platform, or perhaps a style that is richer than can be described
> in detail in CSS---e.g., a rounded edge outline with semitranslucent
> outer pixels that appears to glow.

It's also the case that `auto` allows browsers to use different outlines
for different elements; e.g., the outline for a hyperlink may not be the
same as the outline for a form input. When using `auto`, the value for
`outline-width` may be ignored.

Beyond those differences, outlines have all the same styles that borders
have, as illustrated in
[Figure 7-64](#ch07.xhtml_Variousoutlinestyles){data-type="xref"}.

The less obvious difference is that unlike `border-style`,
`outline-style` is *not* a shorthand property.
[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073258352 primary="logical properties"
secondary="outlines" data-type="indexterm"}You can't use it to set a
different outline style for each side of the outline, because outlines
can't be styled that way. There is no `outline-top-style`. This is true
for all the rest of the outline properties. Because of this aspect of
`outline-style`, the one property serves both physical and logical
layout needs.

There's little to say about outline width that we didn't already say
about border width. If the outline style is `none`, the outline's width
is set to `0`. The `thick` value is wider than `medium`, which is wider
than `thin`, but the specification doesn't define exact widths for these
keywords.
[Figure 7-65](#ch07.xhtml_Variousoutlinewidths){data-type="xref"} shows
a few outline widths.

shorthand property, and serves both physical and logical layout needs.
You can set only one width for the whole outline, and cannot set
different widths for different sides. (The reasons for this will soon
become clear.)

This is pretty much the same as `border-color`, with the caveat that
it's an all-or-nothing proposition---for example, there's no
`outline-left-color`.

The one []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797073207984 primary="invert keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}major difference is the default value, `invert`.
What `invert` is supposed to do is perform a "color conversion" on all
pixels within the visible parts of the outline. The advantage to color
inversion is that it can make the outline stand out in a wide variety of
situations, regardless of what's behind it.

However, as of late 2022, literally no browser engines support `invert`.
(Some did for a while, but that support was removed.) Given this, if you
use `invert`, it will be rejected by the browser, and the color keyword
`currentcolor` will be used instead. (See ["Color
Keywords"](../Text/ch05.xhtml#color_keywords){data-type="xref"} for
details.)

primary="borders" secondary="versus outlines"

surprise that, like `border`, this is a convenient way to set the
overall style, width, and color of an outline.
[Figure 7-66](#ch07.xhtml_Variousoutlines){data-type="xref"} illustrates
a variety of outlines.

<figure class="width-75">

Thus far, outlines seem very much like borders. So how are they
different?

:::: {#ch07.xhtml_how-they-are-different .sect2}
## How They Are Different {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_607}

The first major difference between borders and outlines is that
outlines, like outset border images, don't affect layout at all. In any
way. They're purely presentational.

To understand what this means, consider the following styles,
illustrated in
[Figure 7-67](#ch07.xhtml_Outlineovermargin){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {padding: 10px; border: 10px solid green;
    outline: 10px dashed #9AB; margin: 10px;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Outlineovermargin" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0767.png" width="600" height="131"
alt="css5 0767" />
<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_608"><span class="label">Figure 7-67.
</span>Outline over margin</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Looks normal, right? What you can't see is that the outline is
completely covering up the margin. If we put in a dotted line to show
the margin edges, they'd run right along the outside edge of the
outline. (We'll deal with margins in the next section.)

This is what's meant by outlines not affecting layout. Let's consider
another example, this time with two `<span>` elements that are given
outlines. You can see the results in
[Figure 7-68](#ch07.xhtml_Overlappingoutlines){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
span {outline: 1em solid rgba(0,128,0,0.5);}
span + span {outline: 0.5em double purple;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Overlappingoutlines" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0768.png" width="600" height="41"
alt="css5 0768" />
<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_609"><span class="label">Figure 7-68.
</span>Overlapping outlines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The outlines don't affect the height of the lines, but they also don't
shove the `<span>`s to one side or another. The text is laid out as if
the outlines aren't even there.

This raises an even more interesting feature of outlines: they are not
always rectangular, nor are they always contiguous. Consider this
outline applied to a `<strong>` element that breaks across two lines, as
illustrated in two scenarios in
[Figure 7-69](#ch07.xhtml_Discontinuousandnon-rectangularoutlines){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {outline: 2px dotted gray;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Discontinuousandnon-rectangularoutlines"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0769.png" width="600" height="111"
alt="css5 0769" />
<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_610"><span class="label">Figure 7-69.
</span>Discontinuous and nonrectangular outlines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The first case has two complete outline boxes, one for each fragment of
the `<strong>` element. In the second case, with the longer `<strong>`
element causing the two fragments to be stacked together, the outline is
"fused" into a single polygon that encloses the fragments. You won't
find a border doing *that*.

This is why CSS has no side-specific outline properties like
`outline-right-style`: if an outline becomes nonrectangular, which sides
are the right sides?

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_611}

As of late 2022, not every browser combines the inline fragments into a
single contiguous polygon. In those that do not support this behavior,
each fragment is still a self-contained rectangle, as in the first
example in
[Figure 7-69](#ch07.xhtml_Discontinuousandnon-rectangularoutlines){data-type="xref"}.

between most normal-flow elements occurs because of element *margins*.
Setting a margin creates extra blank space around an element. *Blank

exist and in which the parent element's background is visible.

Suppose you want to set a quarter-inch margin on `<h1>` elements (a
background color has been added so you can clearly see the edges of the
content area):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {margin: 0.25in; background-color: silver;}
```

This sets a quarter-inch of blank space on each side of an `<h1>`
element, as illustrated in
[Figure 7-71](#ch07.xhtml_Settingamarginforh1elements){data-type="xref"}.
Here, dashed lines represent the margin's outer edge, but the lines are
purely illustrative and would not actually appear in a web browser.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch07.xhtml_Settingamarginforh1elements" class="figure">

</span>Setting a margin for <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The `margin` property can accept any length of measure, whether in
pixels, inches, millimeters, or ems. However, the default value for
`margin` is effectively `0`, so if you don't declare a value, by
default, no margin should appear.

In practice, however, browsers come with preassigned styles for many
elements, and margins are no exception. For example, in CSS-enabled
browsers, margins generate the "blank line" above and below each
paragraph element. Therefore, if you don't declare margins for the `<p>`
element, the browser may apply some margins on its own. Whatever you
declare will override the default styles.

Finally, it's possible to set a percentage value for `margin`. The
details of this value type are discussed in ["Percentages and
Margins"](#ch07.xhtml_percentages-and-margins){data-type="xref"}.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797072958384
primary="" startref="ix_margin_prop" data-type="indexterm"}

::: {#ch07.xhtml_length-values-and-margins .sect2}
## Length Values and Margins {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_616}

Any []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797072955376 primary="margins"
secondary="length values" data-type="indexterm"}length value can be used
in setting the margins of an element. It's easy enough, for example, to
apply 10 pixels of whitespace around paragraph elements. The following
rule gives paragraphs a silver background, 10 pixels of padding, and a
10-pixel margin:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-color: silver; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;}
```

This adds 10 pixels of space to each side of every paragraph, just
beyond the outer border edge. You can just as easily use `margin` to set
extra space around an image. Let's say you want 1 em of space
surrounding all images:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {margin: 1em;}
```

That's all it takes.

At times, you might desire a different amount of space on each side of
an element. That's easy as well, thanks to the value replication
behavior we've used before. If you want all `<h1>` elements to have a
top margin of 10 pixels, a right margin of 20 pixels, a bottom margin of
15 pixels, and a left margin of 5 pixels, here's all you need:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {margin: 10px 20px 15px 5px;}
```

It's also possible to mix up the types of length values you use. You
aren't restricted to using a single length type in a given rule, as
shown here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {margin: 14px 5em 0.1in 3ex;} /* value variety! */
```

## Percentages and Margins {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_618}

We can set []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797072819248 primary="margins"
secondary="percentage values" data-type="indexterm"}percentage values
for the margins of an element. As with padding, percentage margin values
are computed in relation to the width of the parent element's content
area, so they can change if the parent element's width changes in some
way. For example, assume the following, which is illustrated in
[Figure 7-73](#ch07.xhtml_Parentwidthsandpercentages){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {margin: 10%;}

<div style="width: 200px; border: 1px dotted;">
    <p>
        This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 200 pixels,
        so its margin will be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent (the
        DIV). Given the declared width of 200 pixels, the margin will be 20
        pixels on all sides.
    </p>
</div>
<div style="width: 100px; border: 1px dotted;">
    <p>
        This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 100 pixels,
        so its margin will still be 10% of the width of the paragraph's
        parent. There will, therefore, be half as much margin on this paragraph
        as on the first paragraph.
    </p>

Note that the top and bottom margins are consistent with the right and
left margins; in other words, the percentage of top and bottom margins
is calculated with respect to the element's width, not its height.

primary="vertical formatting" secondary="collapsing margins"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_collapse_margin2
primary="collapsing margins" data-type="indexterm"}interesting and often
overlooked aspect of the block-start and block-end margins on block
boxes is that they *collapse* in normal-flow layout. This is the process
by which two (or more) margins that interact along the block axis will
collapse to the largest of the interacting margins.

The canonical example of this is the space between paragraphs.
Generally, that space is set using a rule like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {margin: 1em 0;}
```

That sets every paragraph to have block-start and -end margins of `1em`.
If margins *didn't* collapse, then whenever one paragraph followed
another, there would be 2 ems of space between them. Instead, there's
only 1; the two margins collapse together.

To illustrate this a little more clearly, let's return to the
percentage-margin example. This time, we'll add dashed lines to indicate
where the margins fall, as shown in
[Figure 7-74](#ch07.xhtml_Collapsingmargins){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>

The example shows the separation distance between the contents of the
two paragraphs. It's 60 pixels, because that's the wider of the two
margins that are interacting. The 30-pixel block-start margin of the
second paragraph is collapsed, leaving the first paragraph's block-end
margin in charge.

So in a sense,
[Figure 7-74](#ch07.xhtml_Collapsingmargins){data-type="xref"} is lying:
if you take the CSS specification strictly at its word, the block-start
(top) margin of the second paragraph is actually reset to 0. It doesn't
stick into the block-end margin of the first paragraph because once it
collapses, it isn't there anymore. The end result is the same, though.

Margin collapsing also explains some oddities that arise when one
element is inside another. Consider the following styles and markup:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header {background: goldenrod;}
h1 {margin: 1em;}

<header>
    <h1>Welcome to ConHugeCo</h1>
</header>
```

The margin on the `<h1>` will push the edges of the `header` away from
the content of the `<h1>`, right? Well, not entirely. See
[Figure 7-75](#ch07.xhtml_Marginscollapsingwithparents){data-type="xref"}.

What happened? The inline-side margins took effect---we can see that
from the way the text is moved over---but the block-start and block-end
margins are gone!

Only they aren't gone. They're just sticking out of the `header`
element, having interacted with the (zero-width) block-start margin of
the `header` element. The magic of dashed lines in
[Figure 7-76](#ch07.xhtml_Marginscollapsingwithparentsrevealed){data-type="xref"}
shows us what's happening.

There the block-axis margins are---pushing away any content that might
come before or after the `<header>` element, but not pushing away the
edges of the `<header>` itself. This is the intended result, even if
it's often not the *desired* result. As for *why* it's intended, imagine
what happens if you put a paragraph in a list item. Without the
specified margin-collapsing behavior, the paragraph's block-start (in
this case, the top) margin would shove it downward, where it would be
far out of alignment with the list item's bullet [(or
number).]{.keep-together}

Margin collapsing can be interrupted by factors such as padding and
borders on parent elements. For more details, see the discussion in

## Negative Margins {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_628}

It's possible to set []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_neg_margin3
primary="negative margins"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_margin_neg3 primary="margins"
secondary="negative" data-type="indexterm"}negative margins for an
element. This can cause the element's box to stick out of its parent or
to overlap other elements. Consider these rules, which are illustrated
in [Figure 7-77](#ch07.xhtml_Negativemarginsinaction){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {border: 1px solid gray; margin: 1em;}
p {margin: 1em; border: 1px dashed silver;}
p.one {margin: 0 -1em;}
p.two {margin: -1em 0;}
```

<figure>

<h6 id="ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_629"><span class="label">Figure 7-77.
</span>Negative margins in action</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first case, the math works out such that the paragraph's computed
width plus its inline-start and inline-end margins are exactly equal to
the width of the parent `<div>`. So the paragraph ends up 2 ems wider
than the parent element.

In the second case, the negative block-start and block-end margins move
the paragraph's block-start and -end outer edges inward, which is how it
ends up overlapping the paragraphs before and after it.

Combining negative and positive margins is actually very useful. For
example, you can make a paragraph "punch out" of a parent element by
being creative with positive and negative margins, or you can create a
Mondrian effect with several overlapping or randomly placed boxes, as
shown in
[Figure 7-78](#ch07.xhtml_Punchingoutofaparent){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {background: hsl(42,80%,80%); border: 1px solid;}
p {margin: 1em;}
p.punch {background: white; margin: 1em -1px 1em 25%;
  border: 1px solid; border-right: none; text-align: center;}
p.mond {background: rgba(5,5,5,0.5); color: white; margin: 1em 3em -3em -3em;}
```

Thanks to the negative bottom margin for the `mond` paragraph, the
bottom of its parent element is pulled upward, allowing the paragraph to
stick out of the bottom of its parent.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797072348640

## Margins and Inline Elements {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_631}

Margins can also be applied to []{#ch07.xhtml_ix_inline_format_margins
primary="inline formatting" secondary="margins"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch07.xhtml_ix_margins_inline_format
primary="margins" secondary="inline elements"
data-type="indexterm"}inline elements. Let's say you want to set
block-start and block-end margins on strongly emphasized text:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {margin-block-start: 25px; margin-block-end: 50px;}
```

This is allowed in the specification, but on an inline nonreplaced
element, they will have absolutely no effect on the line height (the
same as for padding and borders). And since margins are always
transparent, you won't even be able to see that they're there. In
effect, they'll have no effect at all.

As with padding, the layout effects change a bit when you apply margins
to the inline-start and inline-end sides of an inline nonreplaced
element, as illustrated in
[Figure 7-79](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwithaleftmargin){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {margin-inline-start: 25px; background: silver;}
```

</span>An inline nonreplaced element with an inline-start margin</h6>

</figure>

Note the extra space between the end of the word just before the inline
nonreplaced element and the edge of the inline element's background. You
can add that extra space to both ends of the inline element if you want:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {margin: 25px; background: silver;}
```

As expected,
[Figure 7-80](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwith25-pixelsidemargins){data-type="xref"}
shows a little extra space on the inline-start and -end sides of the
inline element, and no extra space above or below it.

<figure>

Now, when an inline nonreplaced element stretches across multiple lines,
the situation changes.
[Figure 7-81](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwith25-pixelsidemargindisplayedacrosstwolinesoftext){data-type="xref"}
shows what happens when an inline nonreplaced element with a margin is
displayed across multiple lines:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {margin: 25px; background: silver;}
```

</span>An inline nonreplaced element with 25-pixel side margin displayed
across two lines of text</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The inline-start margin is applied to the beginning of the element, and
the inline-end margin to the end of it. Margins are *not* applied to the
inline-start and -end side of each line fragment. Also, you can see
that, if not for the margins, the line may have broken a word or two
sooner. Margins affect line breaking only by changing the point at which
the element's content begins within a line.

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch07.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_635}

You can alter the way margins are (or aren't) applied to the ends of
each line box by using the property `box-decoration-break`. See
[Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"}
for more details.
:::

The situation gets even more interesting when we apply negative margins
to inline nonreplaced elements. The block-start and block-end of the
element aren't affected, and neither are the heights of lines, but the
inline-start and inline-end sides of the element can overlap other
content, as depicted in
[Figure 7-82](#ch07.xhtml_Aninlinenonreplacedelementwithanegativemargin){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

Replaced inline []{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797072055104
primary="replaced elements" secondary="margins"
data-type="indexterm"}elements represent yet another story: margins set
for them *do* affect the height of a line, either increasing or reducing
it, depending on the value for the block-start and block-end
margin.[]{#ch07.xhtml_idm45797072053584 primary=""

By default, the *background area* of an
[]{#ch08.xhtml_ix_backgrounds_ch8 primary="backgrounds"
data-type="indexterm"}element consists of the content box, padding box,
and border box, with the borders drawn on top of the background. (You
can change that to a degree with CSS, as you'll see in this chapter.)

CSS lets you apply one solid opaque or semitransparent color to the
background of an element, as well as apply one or more images to the
background of a single element, or even describe your own color
gradients of various shapes to fill the background area.

If you want the color to extend out a little bit from the content area

code and illustrated in
[Figure 8-1](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig07){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

</span>Background color and padding</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You can set a background color for any element, from `<body>` all the
way down to inline elements such as `<em>` and `<a>`. The value of
`background-color` is not inherited.

Its default value is the keyword `transparent`, which should make sense:
if an element doesn't have a defined color, its background should be
transparent so that the background and content of its ancestor elements
will be visible.

One way to picture what that means is to imagine a clear (i.e.,
transparent) plastic sign mounted to a textured wall. The wall is still
visible through the sign, but this is not the background of the sign;
it's the background of the wall (in CSS terms, anyway). Similarly, if
you set the page canvas to have a background, it can be seen through all
of the elements in the document that don't have their own backgrounds.

They don't inherit the background; it is visible *through* the elements.
This may seem like an irrelevant distinction, but as you'll see when we
discuss background images, it's a critical difference.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Explicitly Setting a Transparent Background" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071943184 .sect2}
## Explicitly Setting a Transparent Background {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_642}

Most of the time, you'll have no reason to use the keyword
`transparent`, []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071941232
primary="transparent backgrounds"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071940496
primary="backgrounds" secondary="transparent"
data-type="indexterm"}since that's the default value. On occasion,
though, it can be useful.

Imagine that a third-party script you have to include has set all images
to have a white background, but your design includes a few transparent
PNG images, and you don't want the background on those images to be
white. To make sure your design choice prevails, you would declare the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.myDesign {background-color: transparent;}
```

Without this (and adding classes to your images), your semitransparent
images would not appear semitransparent; rather, they would look like
they had a solid white background.

While the right color background on a semitransparent image is a
nice-to-have, good contrast between text and the text's background color
is a must-have. If the contrast between text and any part of the
background isn't great enough, the text will be illegible. Always ensure
that the contrast between the text and background is greater than or
equal to 4.5:1 for small text and 3:1 for large text.

Declaring both a color and a background color, with a good contrast, on
your root element is generally considered a good practice. Not declaring
a background color when declaring a color will lead the CSS validator to
generate warnings such as, "You have no `background-color` with your
`color`" to remind you that author-user color interaction can occur, and
your rule has not taken this possibility into account. Warnings do not
mean your styles are invalid: only errors prevent validation.

By combining `color` and `background-color`, you can
[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071911936 primary="color property"
data-type="indexterm"}create interesting effects:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;}
```

[Figure 8-2](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig08){data-type="xref"} depicts this
example.

There are as many color combinations as there are colors, and we can't

you can do.

And then there's the question of what happens when you apply a
background to a replaced element. We already discussed images with
transparent portions, like a PNG or WebP. Suppose, though, you want to
create a two-tone border around a JPEG. You can pull that off by adding
a background color and a little bit of padding to your image, as shown
in the following code and illustrated in
[Figure 8-4](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig10){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.twotone {background-color: red; padding: 5px; border: 5px solid gold;}

</span>Using background and border to two-tone an image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Technically, the background goes to the outer border edge, but since the
border is solid and continuous, we can't see the background behind it.
The 5 pixels of padding allow a thin ring of background to be seen
between the image and its border, creating the visual effect of an
"inner border." This technique could be extended to create more
complicated effects with box shadows (discussed at the end of the
chapter) and background images like gradients (discussed in
[Chapter 9](../Text/ch09.xhtml#gradients){data-type="xref"}).[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071725648

The []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071678416 primary="background painting area"
data-type="indexterm"}default value `border-box` indicates that the
*background painting area* (which is what `background-clip` defines)
extends out to the outer edge of the border. Given this value, the
background will *always* be drawn behind the visible parts of the
border, if any.

If you choose the value `padding-box`, the background will extend to
only the outer edge of the padding area (which is also the inner edge of
the border). Thus, the background won't be drawn behind the border. The
value `content-box`, on the other hand, restricts the background to just
the content area of the element.

The effects of these three values are illustrated in
[Figure 8-5](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig11){data-type="xref"}, which is the
result of the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div[id] {color: navy; background: silver;
         padding: 1em; border: 0.5em dashed;}
#ex01 {background-clip: border-box;}  /* default value */
#ex02 {background-clip: padding-box;}
#ex03 {background-clip: content-box;}
```

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_649"><span class="label">Figure 8-5.
</span>The three box-oriented types of background clipping</h6>
</div>
</figure>

That might seem pretty simple, but several caveats exist. First,
`background-clip` has no effect on the root element (in HTML, that's
either the `<html>` element, or the `<body>` element if you haven't
defined any background styles on `<html>`). This has to do with how the
background painting of the root element has to be handled.

Second, the exact []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071638384 primary="corners"
secondary="rounding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071637376 primary="borders"
secondary="corner rounding" data-type="indexterm"}clipping of the
background area can be reduced if the element has rounded corners,
thanks to the `border-radius` property (see
[Chapter 7](../Text/ch07.xhtml#padding-borders-outlines-and-margins){data-type="xref"}).
This is basically common sense, since if you give your element
significantly rounded corners, you want the background to be clipped by
those corners instead of stick out past them. The way to think of this
is that the background painting area is determined by `background-clip`,
and then any corners that have to be further clipped by rounded corners
are appropriately clipped.[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071634480 primary=""
startref="ix_border_background" data-type="indexterm"}

Third, the value of `background-clip` can interact poorly with some [of
the]{.keep-together} more interesting values of `background-repeat`,
which we'll get to later.

Fourth, `background-clip` defines the
[]{#ch08.xhtml_ix_back_image_clipping primary="background images"
secondary="clipping" data-type="indexterm"}clipping area of the
[background.]{.keep-together} It doesn't affect other background
properties. When it comes to flat background colors, that's a
distinction without meaning; but when it comes to background images,
which we'll talk about in the next section, it can make a great deal of
difference.

There is one more value, `text`, which clips the background to the text
of the element. In other words, the text is "filled in" with the
background, and the rest of the element's background area remains
transparent. This is a simple way to add textures to text, by "filling
in" the text of an element with its background.

The []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071627488 primary="foreground colors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071626752 primary="colors"
secondary="foreground" data-type="indexterm"}kicker is that to see this
effect, you have to remove the foreground color of the element.
Otherwise, the foreground color obscures the background. Consider the
following, which has the result shown in
[Figure 8-6](#ch08.xhtml_cbag_css4_background-clip-text){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {color: rgb(255,0,0); background: rgb(0,0,255);
     padding: 0 1em; margin: 1.5em 1em; border: 0.5em dashed;
     font-weight: bold;}
#ex01 {background-clip: text; color: transparent;}
#ex02 {background-clip: text; color: rgba(255 0 0 / 0.5);}
#ex03 {background-clip: text;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch08.xhtml_cbag_css4_background-clip-text" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_650"><span class="label">Figure 8-6.
</span>Clipping the background to the text</h6>
</div>
</figure>

For the first example, the foreground color is made completely
transparent, and the blue background is visible only where it intersects
with the text shapes in the element's content. It is not visible through
the image inside the paragraph, since an image's foreground can't be set
to `transparent`.

In the second example, the foreground color has been set to
`rgba(255 0 0 0.5)`, which is a half-opaque red. The text there is
rendered purple, because the half-opaque red combines with the blue
underneath. The borders, on the other hand, blend their half-opaque red
with the white background behind them, yielding a light red.

In the third example, the foreground color is a solid, opaque red. The
text and borders are both fully red, with no hint of the blue
background. It can't be seen in this instance, because it's been clipped
to the text. The foreground just completely obscures the
[background.]{.keep-together}

This technique works for any background, including gradient and image
backgrounds, topics that we'll cover in a bit. Remember, however: if the
background for some reason fails to be drawn behind the text, the
transparent text meant to be "filled" with the background will instead
be completely unreadable.

turn now to the subject of background images. By default, images are
tiled, repeating in both horizontal and vertical directions to fill up
the entire background of the document. This default CSS behavior created
horrific websites often referred to as "Geocities 1996," but CSS can do
a great deal more than simple tiling of background images. It can be
used to create subtle beauty. We'll start with the basics and then work
our way up.

The default value of `none` means about what you'd expect: no image is
placed in the background. If you want a background image, you must give
this property at least one image reference, such as in the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(bg23.gif);}
```

Because of the default values of other background properties, this will
cause the image *bg23.gif* to be tiled in the document's background, as
shown in [Figure 8-7](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig12){data-type="xref"}. You'll
learn how to change that shortly.

</span>Applying a background image in CSS</h6>
</div>
</figure>

It's usually a good idea to specify a background color to go along with
your background image; we'll come back to that concept a little later.
(We'll also talk about how to have more than one image at the same time,
but for now we're going to stick to just one background image per
element.)

You can apply background images to any element, block-level or inline.
If you have more than one background image, comma-separate them:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(bg23.gif), url(another_img.png);}
```

If you combine simple icons with creative attribute selectors, you can
(by using properties we'll get to in just a bit) mark when a link points
to a PDF, word processor document, email address, or other unusual
resource. You can, for example, use the following code to display
[Figure 8-8](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig14){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href] {padding-left: 1em; background-repeat: no-repeat;}
a[href$=".pdf"] {background-image: url(/i/pdf-icon.png);}
a[href$=".doc"] {background-image: url(/i/msword-icon.png);}
a[href^="mailto:"] {background-image: url(/i/email-icon.png);}

</span>Adding link icons as background images</h6>
</div>

It's true that you can add multiple background images to an element, but
until you learn how to position each image and prevent it from
repeating, you most likely won't want to. We'll cover repeating
background images after we cover these necessary properties.

Just like `background-color`, `background-image` is not inherited---in
fact, not a single one of the background properties is inherited.
Remember also that when specifying the URL of a background image, it
falls under the usual restrictions and caveats for `url()` values: a
relative URL should be interpreted with respect to the stylesheet (see
["URLs"](../Text/ch05.xhtml#urls){data-type="xref"}).[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071309280

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071305552
primary="inheritance" secondary="background images and"
data-type="indexterm"}specifically noted that backgrounds are not
inherited. Background images demonstrate why inherited backgrounds would
be a bad thing. Imagine a situation that backgrounds were inherited, and
you applied a background image to the `<body>`. That image would be used
for the background of every element in the document, with each element
doing its own tiling, as shown in
[Figure 8-9](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig15){data-type="xref"}.

Note that the pattern restarts at the top left of every element,
including the links. This isn't what most authors would want, and this
is why background properties are not inherited. If you do want this
particular effect for some reason, you can make it happen with a rule
like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
* {background-image: url(yinyang.png);}
```

Alternatively, you could use the value `inherit` like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang.png);}
* {background-image: inherit;}

## Following Good Background Practices {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_659}

Images are []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071233408 primary="background images"
secondary="specifying" data-type="indexterm"}laid on top of whatever
background color you specify. If your images aren't tiled or have areas
that are not opaque, the background will show through, blending its
color with that of the semitransparent images. If the image fails to
load, the background color specified will show instead of the image. For
this reason, it's always a good idea to specify a background color when
using a background image, so that you'll at least get a legible result
if the image doesn't appear.

Background images can cause []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797071212864
primary="accessibility issues" secondary="content/background contrast"
data-type="indexterm"}accessibility issues. For example, if you have an
image of a clear blue sky as a background image with dark text, that is
likely very legible. But what if there is a bird in the sky? If dark
text lands on a dark part of the background, that text will not be
legible. Adding a drop shadow to the text (see
[Chapter 15](../Text/ch15.xhtml#text_properties){data-type="xref"}) or a
list semitransparent background color behind all the text can reduce the
risk of illegibility.

That value syntax looks horrific, but it isn't; it's just what happens
when you try to formalize the fast-and-loose implementations of a new

top of that while trying to reuse parts of the old syntax. (So, OK, kind

For example, we can center a background image in the `<body>` element as
follows, with the result depicted in
[Figure 8-10](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig17){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(hazard-rad.png);

    background-position: center;}

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_663"><span class="label">Figure 8-10.
</span>Centering a single background image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Here, we've placed a single image in the background and then prevented
it from being repeated with `background-repeat`. Every background that
includes an image starts with a single image. This starting image is
called the *origin image*.

The placement of the origin image is accomplished with
`background-position`, and there are several ways to supply values for
this property. First off, we can use the keywords `top`, `bottom`,
`left`, `right`, and `center`. Usually, these appear in pairs, but (as
the previous example shows) this is not always true. We can also use
length values, such as `50px` or `2cm`; the combinations of keywords and
length values, such as `right 50px bottom 2cm`; and finally, percentage
values, such as `43%`. Each type of value has a slightly different
effect on the placement of the background image.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Keywords" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch08.xhtml_cab_keywords .sect3}
### Keywords {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_664}

The image placement keywords are easiest to understand. They have the
effects you'd expect from their names; for example, `top right` would
cause the origin image to be placed in the top-right corner of the
element's background. Let's use a small yin-yang symbol:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top right;}
```

This will place a nonrepeated origin image in the top-right corner of
each paragraph's background, and the result would be exactly the same if
the position were declared as `right top`.

This is because position keywords can appear in any order, as long as
there are no more than two of them---one for the horizontal and one for
the vertical. If you use two horizontal (`right right`) or two vertical
(`top top`) keywords, the whole value is ignored.

If only one keyword appears, the other is assumed to be `center`. So if
you want an image to appear in the top center of every paragraph, you
need only declare this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: top;} /* same as 'top center' */
```
:::
::::

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Percentage values" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch08.xhtml_percentage-values .sect3}
### Percentage values {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_665}

Percentage values are closely related to the keywords, although they
behave in a more sophisticated way. Let's say that you want to center an
origin image within its element by using percentage values. That's
straightforward enough:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(chrome.jpg);
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   background-position: 50% 50%;}
```

This places the origin image such that its center is aligned with the
center of its element's background. In other words, the percentage
values apply to both the element and the origin image. The pixel of the
image that is 50% from the top and 50% from the left in the image is
placed 50% from the top and 50% from the left of the element on which it
was set.

To understand what that means, let's examine the process in closer
detail. When you center an origin image in an element's background, the
point in the image that can be described as `50% 50%` (the center) is
lined up with the point in the background that can be described the same
way. If the image is placed at `0% 0%`, its top-left corner is placed in
the top-left corner of the element's background. Using `100% 100%`
causes the bottom-right corner of the origin image to go into the
bottom-right corner of the background.
[Figure 8-11](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig19){data-type="xref"} contains examples
of those values, as well as a few others, with the points of alignment
for each located at the center of the concentric rings.

Thus, if you want to place a single origin image a third of the way
across the background and two-thirds of the way down, your declaration
would be as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   background-position: 33% 66%;}
```

With these rules, the point in the origin image that is one-third across
and two-thirds down from the top-left corner of the image will be
aligned with the point that is farthest from the top-left corner of the
background. Note that the horizontal value *always* comes first with
percentage values. If you were to switch the percentages in the
preceding example, the point in the image that is two-thirds from the
left side of the image and one-third of the way down from the top would
be placed two-thirds of the way across the background and one-third of
the way down.

</figure>

If you supply only one percentage value, the single value supplied is
taken to be the horizontal value, and the vertical is assumed to be
`50%`. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 25%;}
```

The origin image is placed one-quarter of the way across the paragraph's
background and halfway down it, as if `background-position: 25% 50%;`
had been set.

  : [Table 8-1. ]{.label}Positional equivalents {#cab_table02}

As the property table in ["Positioning Background
Images"](#ch08.xhtml_background-positioning){data-type="xref"} showed,
the default values for `background-position` are `0% 0%`, which is
functionally the same as `top left`. This is why, unless you set
different values for the position, background images always start tiling
from the top-left corner of the element's background.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Length values" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch08.xhtml_length-values .sect3}
### Length values {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_667}

Finally, we turn to []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797070866224 primary="offsets"
secondary="length values" data-type="indexterm"}length values for
positioning. When you supply lengths for the position of the origin
image, they are interpreted as offsets from the top-left corner of the
element's background. The offset point is the top-left corner of the
origin image; thus, if you set the values `20px 30px`, the top-left
corner of the origin image will be 20 pixels to the right of, and 30
pixels below, the top-left corner of the element's background, as shown
(along with a few other length examples) in
[Figure 8-12](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig21){data-type="xref"}. As with
percentages, the horizontal value comes first with length values.

<figure>

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_668"><span class="label">Figure 8-12.
</span>Offsetting the background image by using length measures</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This is quite different from percentage values because the offset is
from one top-left corner to another. In other words, the top-left corner
of the origin image lines up with the point specified in the
`background-position` declaration.

You can combine length and percentage values to get a "best of both
worlds" effect. Let's say you need to have a background image that is
all the way to the right side of the background and 10 pixels down from
the top. As always, the horizontal value comes first:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 100% 10px;
    border: 1px dotted gray;}
```

For that matter, you can get the same result by using `right 10px`,
since you're allowed to mix keywords with lengths and percentages. The
syntax enforces axis order when using nonkeyword values; if you use a
length or percentage value, the horizontal value must *always* come
first, and the vertical must *always* come second. That means
`right 10px` is fine, whereas `10px right` is invalid and will be
ignored (because `right` is not a valid vertical keyword).

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Negative values" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch08.xhtml_negative-values .sect3}
### Negative values {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_669}

If you're using lengths or percentages, you can use negative values to
pull the origin image outside of the element's background. Consider a
document with a very large yin-yang symbol for a background. What if we
want only part of it visible in the top-left corner of the element's
background? No problem, at least in theory.

Assuming that the origin image is 300 pixels tall by 300 pixels wide and
that only the bottom-right third of the image should be visible, we get
the desired effect (shown in
[Figure 8-13](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig23){data-type="xref"}) like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: -200px -200px;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch08.xhtml_cab_fig23" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_670"><span class="label">Figure 8-13.
</span>Using negative length values to position the origin image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Or, say you want just the right half of the origin image to be visible
and vertically centered within the element's background area:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: -150px 50%;}
```

Negative values will come into play later, as they are useful in
creating gorgeous backgrounds; see ["Conic
Gradients"](../Text/ch09.xhtml#conic-gradients){data-type="xref"}.

Negative percentages are also possible, although they are somewhat
interesting to calculate. The origin image and the element are likely to
be very different sizes, for one thing, and that can lead to unexpected
effects. Consider, for example, the situation created by the following
rule, illustrated in
[Figure 8-14](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig24){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(pix/yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: -10% -10%;
    width: 500px;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch08.xhtml_cab_fig24" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0814.png" width="600" height="422"
alt="css5 0814" />
<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_671"><span class="label">Figure 8-14.
</span>Varying effects of negative percentage values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The rule calls for the point outside the origin image defined by
`-10% -10%` to be aligned with a similar point for each paragraph. The
image is 300 × 300 pixels, so we know its alignment point can be
described as 30 pixels above the top of the image, and 30 pixels to the
left of its left edge (effectively `-30px` and `-30px`). The paragraph
elements are all the same width (`500px`), so the horizontal alignment
point is 50 pixels to the left of the left edge of their backgrounds.
This means that each origin image's left edge will be 20 pixels to the
left of the left padding edge of the paragraphs. This is because the
`-30px` alignment point of the images lines up with the `-50px` point
for the paragraphs. The difference between the two is 20 pixels.

The paragraphs have different heights, however, so the vertical
alignment point changes for each paragraph. If a paragraph's background
area is 300 pixels high, to pick a semi-random example, then the top of
the origin image will line up exactly with the top of the element's
background, because both will have vertical alignment points of `-30px`.
If a paragraph is 50 pixels tall, its alignment point would be `-5px`,
and the top of the origin image will actually be 25 pixels *below* the
top of the background. This is why you can see all the tops of the
background images in
[Figure 8-14](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig24){data-type="xref"}---the paragraphs
are shorter than the background image.

::: {#ch08.xhtml_changing-the-offset-edges .sect3}
### Changing the offset edges {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_672}

It's time for a confession: throughout this whole discussion of
background positioning, we've been keeping two facts from you. We acted
as though the value of `background-position` could have no more than two
keywords, and that all []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_offset_position
primary="offsets" secondary="changing edges"
data-type="indexterm"}offsets were always made from the top-left corner
of the background area.

That was originally the case with CSS but hasn't been true for a while.
When we include four keywords, or two keywords and two length or
percentage values in a very specific pattern, we can set the edge from
which the background image should be offset.

Let's start with a simple example: placing the origin image a quarter of
the way across and 30 pixels down from the top-left corner. Using what
we saw in previous sections, that would be the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-position: 25% 30px;
```

Now let's do the same thing with this four-part syntax:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-position: left 25% top 30px;
```

This four-part value says, "From the `left` edge, have a horizontal
offset of `25%`; from the `top` edge, have an offset of `30px`."

Great, so that's a more verbose way of getting the default behavior. Now
let's change the code so the origin image is placed a quarter of the way
across and 30 pixels up from the bottom-right corner, as shown in
[Figure 8-15](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig25){data-type="xref"} (which assumes no
repeating of the background image, for clarity's sake):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-position: right 25% bottom 30px;
```

Here, we have a value that means "from the `right` edge, have a
horizontal offset of `25%`; from the `bottom` edge, have an offset of
`30px`."

Thus, the general pattern is *edge keyword, offset distance, edge
keyword, offset distance*. You can mix the order of horizontal and
vertical information; that is, `bottom 30px right 25%` works just as
well as `right 25% bottom 30px`. However, you cannot omit either of the
edge keywords; `30px right 25%` is invalid and will be ignored.

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_673"><span class="label">Figure 8-15.
</span>Changing the offset edges for the origin image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

That said, you can omit an offset distance when you want it to be 0. So
`right` [`bottom`]{.keep-together} `30px` would put the origin image
against the right edge and 30 pixels up from the bottom of the
background area, whereas `right 25% bottom` would place the origin image
a quarter of the way across from the right edge and up against the
bottom. These are both illustrated in
[Figure 8-16](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig26){data-type="xref"}.

</span>Inferred zero-length offsets</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You can define only the edges of an element as offset bases, not the
center. A value like `center 25% center 25px` will be ignored.

If you have multiple background images and only one background position,
all the images will be placed in the same location. If you want to place
them in different spots, provide a comma-separated list of background
positions. They will be applied to the images in order. If you have more
images than position values, the positions get repeated (as we'll
explore further later in the chapter).[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797070568112

This property probably looks similar to `background-clip`, and with good
reason, but its effect is distinct. Whereas `background-clip` defines
the *background painting area*, `background-origin` defines the edge
that's used to determine placement of the origin image. This is also
known as *defining the background positioning area*.

The default, `padding-box`, means that the top-left corner of the origin
image will be placed in the top-left corner of the outer edge of the
element's padding box (if `background-position` hasn't been changed from
its default of `top left` or `0 0`), which is just inside the border
area.

If you use the value `border-box`, the top-left corner of a
`background-position: 0 0` origin image will go into the top-left corner
of the padding area. The border, if any, will be drawn over the origin
image (assuming the background painting area wasn't restricted to be
`padding-box` or `content-box`, that is).

With `content-box`, you shift the origin image to the top-left corner of
the content area. The following code depicts the three options,
illustrated in [Figure 8-17](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig27){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div[id] {color: navy; background: silver;

         padding: 1em; border: 0.5em dashed;}
#ex01 {background-origin: border-box;}
#ex02 {background-origin: padding-box;}  /* default value */

Remember that this "placed in the top left" behavior is the default
behavior, which you can change with `background-position`. The position
of the origin image is calculated with respect to the box defined by
`background-origin`: the border edge, the padding edge, or the content
edge. Consider, for example, this variant of our previous example, which
is illustrated in
[Figure 8-18](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig28){data-type="xref"}:

Things can get *really* interesting if you've explicitly defined your
background origin and clipping to be different boxes. Imagine you have
the origin placed with respect to the padding edge but the background
clipped to the content area, or vice versa. The following code results
in [Figure 8-19](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig29){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
 #ex01 {background-origin: padding-box;

In the first example, the edges of the origin image are clipped because
it is positioned with respect to the padding box, but the background
painting area has been clipped at the edge of the content box. In the
second example, the origin image is placed with respect to the content
box, but the painting area extends into the padding box. Thus, the
origin image is visible all the way down to the bottom padding edge,
even though its top is not placed against the top padding
edge.[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797070311072 primary=""

other two, `repeat-x` and `repeat-y`, are considered shorthand for
combinations of the others.
[Table 8-2](#ch08.xhtml_cab_table03){data-type="xref"} shows how they
break down.

If two values are given, the first applies in the horizontal direction,
and the second in the vertical. If there is just one value, it applies
in both the horizontal and vertical directions, with the exception, as
shown in [Table 8-2](#ch08.xhtml_cab_table03){data-type="xref"}, of
`repeat-x` and `repeat-y`.

  `round`          `round round`

  : [Table 8-2. ]{.label}Repeat keyword equivalents {#cab_table03}

As you might guess, `repeat` by itself causes the image to tile
infinitely in all directions. The `repeat-x` and `repeat-y` values cause
the image to be repeated in the horizontal or vertical directions,
respectively, and `no-repeat` prevents the image from tiling along a
given axis. If you have more than one image, each with different repeat
patterns, provide a comma-separated list of values. We said "all
directions" rather than "both directions" because a
`background-position` may have put the initial repeating image somewhere
other than the top-left corner of the clip box. With `repeat`, the image
repeats in all directions. By default, the background image will start
from the top-left corner of an element. Therefore, the following rules
will have the effect shown in
[Figure 8-20](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig30){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
      background-repeat: repeat-y;}
```

</span>Tiling the background image vertically</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Let's assume, though, that you want the image to repeat only across the
top of the document. Rather than creating a special image with a whole
lot of blank space underneath, you can just make a small change to that
last rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
      background-repeat: repeat-x;}
```

As [Figure 8-21](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig31){data-type="xref"} shows, the
image is repeated along the x-axis (horizontally) from its starting
position---in this case, the top-left corner of the `<body>` element's
background area.

<figure>
<div id="ch08.xhtml_cab_fig31" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_683"><span class="label">Figure 8-21.
</span>Tiling the background image horizontally</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Finally, you may not want to repeat the background image. In this case,
use the value [`no-repeat`:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
      background-repeat: no-repeat;}
```

With this tiny image, `no-repeat` may not seem terribly useful, but it
is the most common value, and unfortunately not the default. Let's try
it again with a much bigger symbol. The following code results in
[Figure 8-22](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig32){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang.png);

</span>Placing a single large background image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The ability to control the repeat direction dramatically expands the
range of possible effects. For example, let's say you want a triple
border on the left side of each `<h1>` element in your document. You can
take that concept further and decide to set a wavy border along the top
of each `<h2>` element. The image is colored in such a way that it
blends with the background color and produces the wavy effect shown in
[Figure 8-23](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig33){data-type="xref"}, which is the
result of the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {background-image: url(triplebor.gif); background-repeat: repeat-y;}
h2 {background-image: url(wavybord.gif); background-repeat: repeat-x;

### Positioning images that repeat {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_687}

In the []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797070062416 primary="background images"
secondary="positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797070061408
primary="positioning" secondary="background images"
data-type="indexterm"}previous section, we explored the values
`repeat-x`, `repeat-y`, and `repeat`, and how they affect the tiling of
background images. In each case, the tiling pattern always started from
the top-left corner of the element's background. That's because, as
you've seen, the default values for `background-position` are `0% 0%`.
Given that you know how to change the position of the origin image, you
need to know how user agents will handle it.

It will be easier to show an example and then explain it. Consider the
following markup, which is illustrated in
[Figure 8-24](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig34){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background-image: url(yinyang-sm.png);
    background-position: center;
    border: 1px dotted gray;}
p.c1 {background-repeat: repeat-y;}
p.c2 {background-repeat: repeat-x;}
```

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_688"><span class="label">Figure 8-24.
</span>Centering the origin image and repeating it</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So there you have it: stripes running through the center of the
elements. It may look wrong, but it isn't.

These examples are correct because the origin image has been placed in
the center of the first `<p>` element. In the first example, the image
is tiled along the y-axis *in both* [*directions*---up]{.keep-together}
*and* down, starting from the origin image at the center. In the second
example, the images are tiled along the x-axis, starting from the origin
image, and repeated to both the right *and* left. You may notice the
first and last repetitions are slightly cut off, whereas when we started
with `background-position: 0 0`, only the last image, or rightmost and
bottommost images, risked being clipped.

Setting an image in the center of the `<p>` and then letting it fully
repeat will cause it to tile in all *four* directions: up, down, left,
and right. The only difference `background-position` makes is in where
the tiling starts. When the background image repeats from the center,
the grid of yin-yang symbols is centered within the element, resulting
in consistent clipping along the edges. When the tiling begins at the
top-left corner of the padding area, the clipping is not consistent
around the edges. The `spacing` and `rounding` values, on the other
hand, prevent image clipping but have their own drawbacks.

### Spacing and rounding repeat patterns {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_690}

Beyond the []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_spacing_back_image primary="spacing"
secondary="background images"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_ix_back_image_space
primary="background images" secondary="spacing"
data-type="indexterm"}basic tiling patterns you've seen thus far,
`background-repeat` has the ability to exactly fill out the background
area. Consider, for example, what happens if we use the value `space` to
define the tiling pattern, as shown in
[Figure 8-25](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig36){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#example {background-image: url(yinyang.png);

</span>Tiling the background image with filler space</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You'll notice background images in each of the four corners of the
element. Furthermore, the images are spaced out so that they occur at
regular intervals in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

This is what `space` does: it determines the number of repetitions that
will fully fit along a given axis, and then spaces them out at regular
intervals so that the repetitions go from one edge of the background to
another. This doesn't guarantee a regular square grid, with intervals
that are all the same both horizontally and vertically. It just means
that you'll have what look like columns and rows of background images.
While no image will be clipped, unless there isn't enough room for even
one iteration (as can happen with very large background images), this
value often results in different horizontal and vertical separations.
[Figure 8-26](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig37){data-type="xref"} shows some
examples.

<figure>

###### Note {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_693}

Keep in mind that any background color, or the "backdrop" of the element
(that is, the combined backgrounds of the element's ancestors) will show
through the gaps between `space`-separated background images.
:::

What happens if you have a really big image that won't fit more than
once, or even once, along the given axis? That image is drawn once,
placed as determined by the value of `background-position`, and clipped
as necessary. The flip side is that if more than one repetition of [ the
image]{.keep-together} will fit along an axis, the value of
`background-position` is ignored along that axis. The following code,
for example, displays
[Figure 8-27](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig38){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#example {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
            background-position: center;
            background-repeat: space;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch08.xhtml_cab_fig38" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_694"><span class="label">Figure 8-27.
</span>Spacing along one axis but not the other</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the images are spaced horizontally, and thus override the
`center` position along that axis, but are centered vertically and not
spaced (because there isn't enough room to do so). That's the effect of
`space` overriding `center` along one axis but not the other.

By contrast, the []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069905088
primary="background images" secondary="rounding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069904080
primary="rounding corners" data-type="indexterm"}value `round` will most
likely result in scaling of the background image as it is repeated,
*and* (strangely enough) will not override `background-position`. If an
image won't quite repeat so that it goes from edge to edge of the
background, that image will be scaled up *or* down to make it fit a
whole number of times.

Furthermore, the images can be []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069901200
primary="scaling factor" data-type="indexterm"}scaled differently along
each axis. The `round` value is the only background property value that
can alter an image's intrinsic aspect ratio automatically if needed.
While `background-size` can also lead to a change in the aspect ratio,
distorting the image, this happens only by explicit direction from the
author. You can see an example in
[Figure 8-28](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig39){data-type="xref"}, which is the
result of the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
      background-position: top left;
      background-repeat: round;}
```

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_695"><span class="label">Figure 8-28.
</span>Tiling the background image with scaling</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note that if you have a background 850 pixels wide and a horizontally
rounded image that's 300 pixels wide, a browser can decide to use three
images and scale them down to fit three across into the 850-pixel area
(thus making each instance of the image 283.333 pixels wide). With
`space`, the browser would have to use two images and put 250 pixels of
space between them, but `round` is not so constrained.

Here's the interesting wrinkle: while `round` will resize the images so
that you can fit a whole number of them into the background, it will
*not* move them to make sure that they actually touch the edges of the
background. The only way to make sure your repeating pattern fits and no
background images are clipped is to put the origin image in a corner. If
the origin image is anywhere [else,]{.keep-together} clipping will
occur. The following code shows an example, illustrated in
[Figure 8-29](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig40){data-type="xref"}:[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069852208
primary="" startref="ix_back_image_space"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069851232 primary=""
startref="ix_spacing_back_image" data-type="indexterm"}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
      background-position: center;
      background-repeat: round;}
```

</span>Rounded background images that are clipped</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The images are still scaled so that they would fit into the background
positioning area a whole number of times. They just aren't repositioned
to actually do so. Thus, if you're going to use `round` and don't want
to have any clipped background tiles, make sure you're starting from one
of the four corners (and make sure the background positioning and
painting areas are the same; see ["Tiling and clipping repeated
backgrounds"](#ch08.xhtml_tiling-and-clipping){data-type="xref"

primary="clipping" secondary="backgrounds" data-type="indexterm"}recall,
`background-clip` can alter the area in which the background is drawn,
and `background-origin` determines the placement of the origin image. So
what happens when you've made the clipping area and the origin area
different, *and* you're using either `space` or `round` for the tiling
pattern?

The basic answer is that if your values for `background-origin` and
`background-clip` aren't the same, clipping will happen. This is because
`space` and `round` are calculated with respect to the background
positioning area, not the painting area.
[Figure 8-30](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig41){data-type="xref"} shows some
examples of what can happen.

As for the best combination of values to use, that's a matter of opinion
and circumstance. In most cases, setting both `background-origin` and
`background-clip` to `padding-box` will likely get you the results you
desire. If you plan to have borders with see-through bits, though,
`border-box` might be a better choice.[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069779424

Now you know how to []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_back_image_attach
primary="background images" secondary="attaching to viewing area"
data-type="indexterm"}place the origin image for the background anywhere
in the background of an element, and you know how to control (to a large
degree) the way it tiles. As you may have realized already, placing an
image in the center of the `<body>` element could mean, given a
sufficiently long document, that the background image won't be initially
visible to the reader. After all, a browser is a viewport providing a
window onto the document. []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069772448
primary="scrolling" secondary="attaching background image and"
data-type="indexterm"}If the document is too long to be completely shown
in the viewport, the user can scroll back and forth through the
document. The center of the body could be two or three "screens" below
the beginning of the document, or just far enough down to push most of
the origin image beyond the bottom of the browser window.

Furthermore, if the []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_background_attach_prop
primary="background-attachment property" data-type="indexterm"}origin
image is initially visible, by default it scrolls with the
[document---]{.keep-together}vanishing when the user scrolls beyond the
location of the image. Never fear: CSS provides a way to prevent the
background image from scrolling out of view.

```{=html}
</aside>
```
Using the property `background-attachment`, you can declare the origin
image to [be fixed]{.keep-together} with respect to the viewing area and
therefore immune to the effects of scrolling:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-attachment: fixed;}
```

Doing this has two immediate effects. First, the origin image does not
scroll along with the document. Second, the placement of the origin
image is determined by the size of the viewport, not the size (or
placement within the viewport) of the element that contains it.
[Figure 8-31](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig43){data-type="xref"} shows the image
still sitting in the center of the viewport, even though the document
has been scrolled partway through the text.

<figure>
<div id="ch08.xhtml_cab_fig43" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0831.png" width="600" height="293"

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_701"><span class="label">Figure 8-31.
</span>The centering continues to hold</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The element-specific version of `fixed` is `local`. In this case,
though, the effect is seen only when an element's content (rather than
the whole document) has to be scrolled. This is tricky to grasp at
first. Consider the following, where `background-attachment` is
defaulting to `scroll`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
aside {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-position: top right; background-repeat: no-repeat;
    max-height: 20em;
    overflow: scroll;}
```

In this situation, if the content of an `aside` is taller than 20 em,
the overflowed content is not visible but can be accessed using a
scrollbar. The background image, however, will *not* scroll with the
content. It will instead stay in the top-right corner of the element
box.

By adding `background-attachment: local`, the image is attached to the
local context. The visual effect is rather like an `iframe`, if you have
any experience with those.
[Figure 8-32](#ch08.xhtml_cbag_css4_background-attachment-local){data-type="xref"}
shows the results of the previous code sample and the following code
side [by side:]{.keep-together}

</div>
</figure>

One other value for `background-attachment` is the default value
`scroll`. As you might expect, this causes the background image to
scroll along with the rest of the document when viewed in a web browser,
and it doesn't necessarily change the position of the origin image as
the window is resized. If the document width is fixed (perhaps by
assigning an explicit `width` to the `<body>` element), resizing the
viewing area won't affect the placement of a scroll-attachment origin
image at all.

::: {#ch08.xhtml_useful-side-effects .sect3}
### Useful side effects of attached backgrounds {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_703}

In technical terms, when a background image has been fixed, it is
positioned with respect to the viewing area, not the element that
contains it. However, the background will be visible only within its
containing element. Aligning images to the viewport, rather than the
element, can be used to our advantage.

Let's say you have a document with a tiled background that actually
looks like it's tiled, and both `<h1>` and `<h2>` elements with the same
pattern, only in a different color. You set both the `<body>` and
heading elements to have fixed backgrounds as follows, resulting in
[Figure 8-33](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig44){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background-image: url(grid1.gif); background-repeat: repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;}
h1, h2 {background-image: url(grid2.gif); background-repeat: repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;}
```

This neat trick is made possible because when a background's attachment
is `fixed`, the origin element is positioned with respect to the
*viewport*. Thus, both background patterns begin tiling from the
top-left corner of the viewport, not from the individual elements. For
the `<body>`, you can see the entire repeat pattern. For the `<h1>`,
however, the only place you can see its background is in the padding and
content of the `<h1>` itself. Since both background images are the same
size and have precisely the same origin, they appear to line up, as
shown in [Figure 8-33](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig44){data-type="xref"}.

</span>Perfect alignment of backgrounds</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This capability can be used to create sophisticated effects. One of the
most famous examples is the ["complexspiral distorted"
demonstration](https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/glassy.xhtml),
shown in [Figure 8-34](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig45){data-type="xref"}.

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_705"><span class="label">Figure 8-34.
</span>The complexspiral distorted</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The visual effects are caused by assigning different fixed-attachment
background images to non-`<body>` elements. The entire demo is driven by
one HTML document, four JPEG images, and a stylesheet. Because all four
images are positioned in the [top-left]{.keep-together} corner of the
browser window but are visible only where they intersect with their
elements, the images line up to create the illusion of translucent
rippled glass. (Now we can use SVG filters for these sorts of special
effects, but fixed-attachment backgrounds made creating faux filters
possible back in 2002.)[]{#ch08.xhtml_ix_back_size_prop
primary="background-size property" data-type="indexterm"}

It is also the case that in paged media, such as printouts, every page
generates its own viewport. Therefore, a fixed-attachment background
should appear on every page of the printout. This could be used for
effects such as watermarking all the pages in a
document.[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069545984 primary=""

Thus far, we've []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_back_image_size

into element backgrounds to be repeated (or not), positioned, clipped,

repeating). Ready to actually change the size of the origin image and
all the tiled images that spawn from it?

Let's start by explicitly resizing a background image. We'll drop in an
image that's 200 × 200 pixels and then resize it to be twice as big. The
following code results in
[Figure 8-35](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig46){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: 400px 400px;}
```

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_708"><span class="label">Figure 8-35.
</span>Resizing the origin image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

With `background-size`, we can resize the origin image to be smaller. We
can size it using ems, pixels, viewport widths, any length unit, or a
combination thereof.

We can even distort the image by changing its size.
[Figure 8-36](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig47){data-type="xref"} illustrates the
results when changing the previous code sample to use
`background-size: 400px 4em`, with both repeated and nonrepeated
backgrounds.

<figure>

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_709"><span class="label">Figure 8-36.
</span>Distorting the origin image by resizing it</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As you can see, when `background-size` has two values, the first is the
horizontal size and the second is the vertical. If you allow the image
to repeat, all the repeated images will be the same size as the origin
image.

Percentages are a little more interesting. If you declare a percentage
value, it's calculated with respect to the background positioning
area---that is, the area defined by `background-origin`, and *not* by
`background-clip`. Suppose you want an image that's half as wide and
half as tall as its background positioning area; the following code
results in [Figure 8-37](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig48){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-size: 50% 50%;
```

And yes, you can mix lengths and percentages:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-size: 25px 100%;
```

Negative length and percentage values are not permitted for
`background-size`.

::: {#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069425632 .sect3}
### Maintaining the background image's aspect ratio {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_711}

Now, what about the []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069424032
primary="aspect-ratio, background image" data-type="indexterm"}default
value of `auto`? First off, when only one value is provided, it's taken
for the horizontal size, and the vertical size is set to `auto`. (Thus
`background-size: auto` is equivalent to `background-size: auto auto`.)
If you want to size the origin image vertically and leave the horizontal
size to be automatic, thus preserving the intrinsic aspect ratio of the
image, you have to write it explicitly, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-size: auto 333px;
```

In many ways, `auto` in `background-size` acts a lot like the `auto`
values of `height` and `width` (also `block-size` and `inline-size`)
when applied to replaced elements such as images. That is to say, you'd
expect roughly similar results from the following two rules, if they
were applied to the same image in different contexts:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.yinyang {width: 300px; height: auto;}

main {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 300px auto;}
```

### Covering and containing {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_712}

Now for some real fun! []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_cover_back_image
primary="cover, background image" data-type="indexterm"}Suppose you want
to cover the entire background of an element with an image, and you
don't care if parts of it stick outside the background painting area. In
this case, you can use `cover`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;}
```

This scales the origin image so that it completely covers the background
positioning area while still preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio,
assuming it has one. You can [see an example]{.keep-together} in
[Figure 8-38](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig50){data-type="xref"}, where a 200 ×
200 pixel image is scaled up to cover the background of an 800 × 400
pixel element. The following code provides this result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {width: 800px; height: 400px;
    background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-position: center;
    background-size: cover;}
```

Note that there is no `background-repeat` in this example. That's
because we expect the image to fill out the entire background, so
whether it's repeated or not doesn't really [matter.]{.keep-together}

You can also see that `cover` is very different from `100% 100%`. If
we'd used `100% 100%`, the origin image would have been stretched to be
800 pixels wide by 400 pixels tall. Instead, `cover` made it 800 pixels
wide and tall, then centered the image inside the background positioning
area. This is the same as if we'd said `100% auto` in this particular
case, but the beauty of `cover` is that it works regardless of whether
your element is wider than it is tall, or taller than it is wide.

</span>Covering the background with the origin image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

By []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_contain_back_image
primary="containing background image" data-type="indexterm"}contrast,
`contain` will scale the image so that it fits exactly inside the
background positioning area, even if that leaves some of the rest of the
background showing around it. This is illustrated in
[Figure 8-39](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig51){data-type="xref"}, which is the
result of the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {width: 800px; height: 400px;
    background-image: url(yinyang.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-size: contain;}
```

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_714"><span class="label">Figure 8-39.
</span>Containing the origin image within the background</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this case, since the element is shorter than it is tall, the origin
image is scaled so it is as tall as the background positioning area, and
the width is scaled to match, just as if we'd declared `auto 100%`. If
an element is taller than it is wide, `contain` acts like `100% auto`.

You'll []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069170992 primary="background images"

primary="repeating elements" secondary="background images"
data-type="indexterm"}note that we brought `no-repeat` back to the
example so the visual result wouldn't become too visually confusing.
Removing that declaration would cause the background to repeat, which is
no big deal if that's what you want.
[Figure 8-40](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig52){data-type="xref"} shows the result.

Always remember: the sizing of `cover` and `contain` images is always
with respect to the background positioning area, which is defined by
`background-origin`. []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797069163776

primary="background-clip property" data-type="indexterm"}This is true
even if the background painting area defined by `background-clip` is
different! Consider the following rules, which are depicted in
[Figure 8-41](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig53){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

     /* that’s shorthand 'background', explained in the next section */
.cover {background-size: cover;}

</span>Covering and containing with <code>background-clip</code> and
<code>background-origin</code></h6>
</div>
</figure>

Yes, you can see background color around the edges of some of these, and
others get clipped. That's the difference between the painting area and
the positioning area. You'd think that `cover` and `contain` would be
sized with respect to the painting area, but they aren't, as depicted in
the last examples in
[Figure 8-41](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig53){data-type="xref"}. Keep that firmly
in mind whenever you use these values.

If you have more than one background image, with different values for
position, repeat, or size, include a comma-separated list of values.
Each value in a list will be associated with the image in that position
in the list. If there are more values than images, the extra values are
ignored. If there are fewer, the list is repeated. You can set only one
background color, though.

In this section, we used raster images (GIFs, to be precise) even though
they tend to look horrible when scaled up and represent a waste of
network resources when scaled down. (We did this so that it would be
extra obvious when lots of up-scaling was happening.) This is an
inherent risk in scaling background raster images. On the other hand,
you can just as easily use SVGs as background images, and they scale up
or down with no loss of quality or waste of bandwidth. If you're going
to be scaling a background image and it doesn't have to be a photograph,
strongly consider using SVG or CSS

primary="positioning" secondary="backgrounds" data-type="indexterm"}mix
up the order of the values however you like, with three restrictions.
First, any `background-size` value *must* come immediately after the
`background-position` value, and must be separated from it by a forward
slash (`/`). Second, within those values, the usual restrictions apply:
the horizontal value comes first, and the vertical value follows,
assuming that you're supplying axis-derived values (as opposed to, say,
`cover`).

Third, if you supply values for both `background-origin` and
`background-clip`, the first of the two you list will be assigned to
`background-origin`, and the second to `background-clip`. Therefore, the
following two rules are functionally identical:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background:
    url(yinyang.png) top left/50% 50% padding-box border-box white
     repeat-y fixed;}
body {background:
    url(yinyang.png) top left/50% 50% padding-box white repeat-y
     fixed border-box;}
```

Related to that, if you []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068824160

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068822144
primary="backgrounds" secondary="clipping" data-type="indexterm"}supply
only one such value, it sets both `background-origin` and
`background-clip`. Thus, the following shorthand sets both the
background positioning area and the background painting area to the
padding box:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background:
    url(yinyang.png) padding-box top left/50% 50% border-box;}
```

As is the case for shorthand properties, if you leave out any values,
the defaults for the relevant properties are filled in automatically.
Thus, the following two are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background: white url(yinyang.png;}
body {background: white url(yinyang.png) transparent 0% 0%/auto repeat
      scroll padding-box border-box;}
```

Even better, `background` has no required values---as long as you have
at least one value present, you can omit the rest. It's possible to set
just the background color using the shorthand property, which is a very
common practice:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background: white;}
```

On that note, remember that `background` is a shorthand property, and,
as such, its default values can obliterate previously assigned values
for a given element. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, h2 {background: gray url(thetrees.jpg) center/contain repeat-x;}
h2 {background: silver;}
```

Given these rules, `<h1>` elements will be styled according to the first
rule. And `<h2>` elements will be styled according to the second, which
means they'll just have a flat silver background. No image will be
applied to `<h2>` backgrounds, let alone centered and repeated
horizontally. It is more likely that the author meant to do this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, h2 {background: gray url(thetrees.jpg) center/contain repeat-x;}
h2 {background-color: silver;}
```

This lets the background color be changed without wiping out all the
other values.

One more restriction will lead us very neatly into the next section: you
can supply a background color to only the final background layer. No
other background layer can have a solid color declared. What the heck
does that mean? So glad you asked.[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068600096

## Working with Multiple Backgrounds {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_721}

Throughout []{#ch08.xhtml_ix_back_image_multi
primary="background images" secondary="multiple"
data-type="indexterm"}most of this chapter, we've only briefly mentioned
that almost all the background properties accept a comma-separated list
of values. For example, if you wanted to have three different background
images, you could do this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {background-image: url(bg01.png), url(bg02.gif), url(bg03.jpg);
         background-repeat: no-repeat;}
```

Seriously. It will look like
[Figure 8-43](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig55){data-type="xref"}.

<div id="ch08.xhtml_cab_fig55" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_722"><span class="label">Figure 8-43.
</span>Multiple background images</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This creates three background layers, one for each image, with the last
being the final, bottom background layer.

The three images are piled into the top-left corner of the element and
don't repeat. []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068558080
primary="background images" secondary="repeating"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068557104
primary="background-repeat property" data-type="indexterm"}The lack of
repetition occurs because we declared `background-repeat: no-repeat`. We
declared it only once, and there are three background images.

When a mismatch occurs between the number of values in a
background-related property and the `background-image` property, the
missing values are derived by repeating the sequence in the property
with a value undercount. Thus, in the previous example, it was as though
we had said this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat, no-repeat;
```

Now, []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068513264 primary="background images"
secondary="positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068528048
primary="positioning" secondary="background images"
data-type="indexterm"}suppose we want to put the first image at the top
right, put the second at the center of the left side, and put the last
layer at the center of the bottom. We can layer `background-position` as
follows, resulting in
[Figure 8-44](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig56){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {background-image: url(bg01.png), url(bg02.gif), url(bg03.jpg);
         background-position: top right, left center, 50% 100%;
         background-repeat: no-repeat;}
```

<figure>

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_723"><span class="label">Figure 8-44.
</span>Individually positioning background images</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Similarly, say we want to keep the first two layers from repeating, but
horizontally repeat the third:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {background-image: url(bg01.png), url(bg02.gif), url(bg03.jpg);
         background-position: top right, left center, 50% 100%;
         background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat, repeat-x;}
```

Nearly every background property can be comma-listed this way. You can
have different origins, clipping boxes, sizes, and just about everything
else for each background layer you create. Technically, there is no
limit to the number of layers you can have, though at a certain point
it's just going to get silly.

Even the shorthand `background` can be comma-separated. The following
example is exactly equivalent to the previous one, and the result is
shown in [Figure 8-45](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig57){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {
    background: url(bg01.png) right top no-repeat,
                url(bg02.gif) center left no-repeat,
                url(bg03.jpg) 50% 100% repeat-x;}
```

primary="background-color property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068358544
primary="background images" secondary="background color"
data-type="indexterm"}restriction on multiple backgrounds is that
`background-color` does *not* repeat in this manner, and if you provide
a comma-separated list for the `background` shorthand, the color can
appear on only the last background layer. If you add a color to any
other layer, the entire `background` declaration is made invalid. Thus,
if we want to have a green background fill for the previous example,
we'd do it in one of the following two ways:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {
    background: url(bg01.png) right top no-repeat,
                url(bg02.gif) center left no-repeat,
                url(bg03.jpg) 50% 100% repeat-x green;}
section {
    background: url(bg01.png) right top no-repeat,
                url(bg02.gif) center left no-repeat,
                url(bg03.jpg) 50% 100% repeat-x;
    background-color: green;}
```

The reason for this restriction is pretty straightforward. Imagine if
you were able to add a full background color to the first background
layer. It would fill in the whole background and obscure all the
background layers behind it! So if you do supply a color, it can be on
only the last layer, which is "bottommost."

This ordering is important to internalize as soon as possible, because
it runs counter to the instincts you've likely built up in the course of
using CSS. After all, you know what will happen here---the `<h1>`
background will be green:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {background-color: red;}
h1 {background-color: green;}
```

Contrast that with this multiple-background rule, which will make the
`<h1>` background red:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {background:
    url(box-red.gif),
    url(box-green.gif),
    green;}
```

Yes, red. The red GIF is tiled to cover the entire background area, as
is the green GIF, but the red GIF is "on top of" the green GIF. It's
closer to you. And the effect is exactly backward from the "last one
wins" rules built into the cascade.

You can visualize it like this: when there are multiple backgrounds,
they're listed like the layers in a drawing program such as Adobe
Photoshop or Illustrator. In the layer palette of a drawing program,
layers at the top of the palette are drawn over the layers at the
bottom. The same process plays out here: the layers listed at the top of
the list are drawn over the layers at the bottom of the list.

The odds are pretty good that you will, at some point, set up a bunch of
background layers in the wrong order, because your cascade-order
reflexes will kick in. (This error still occasionally trips up the
authors even to this day, so don't get down on yourself if it gets you
too.)

Another fairly common mistake when you're getting started with multiple
backgrounds is to use the `background` shorthand and forget to
explicitly turn off background tiling for your background layers by
letting the `background-repeat` value default to `repeat`, thus
obscuring all but the top layer. See
[Figure 8-46](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig59){data-type="xref"}, for example,
which is the result of the [following]{.keep-together} code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {background-image: url(bg02.gif), url(bg03.jpg);}
```

We can see only the top layer because it's tiling infinitely, thanks to
the default value of `background-repeat`. That's why the example at the
beginning of this section used
`background-repeat: no-repeat`.[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068170512

## Using the Background Shorthand {#ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_726}

One way to []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068166096
primary="background property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068165360
primary="background images" secondary="shorthand properties"
data-type="indexterm"}avoid these sorts of situations is to use the
`background` shorthand, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background:
         url(bg01.png) top left border-box no-repeat,
         url(bg02.gif) bottom center padding-box no-repeat,
         url(bg04.svg) bottom center padding-box no-repeat gray;}
```

That way, when you add or subtract background layers, the values you
meant to apply specifically to them will come in or go out with them.

This can mean some annoying repetition if all the backgrounds should
have the same value of a given property, like `background-origin`. If
that's the situation, you can blend the two approaches, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background:
         url(bg01.png) top left no-repeat,
         url(bg02.gif) bottom center no-repeat,
         url(bg04.svg) bottom center no-repeat gray;
     background-origin: padding-box;}
```

This works just as long as you don't need to make any exceptions. The
minute you decide to change the origin of one of those background
layers, you'll need to explicitly list them, whether you do it in
`background` or with the separate `background-origin` declaration.

Remember that the number of layers is determined by the number of
background images, and so, by definition, `background-image` values are
*not* repeated to equal the number of comma-separated values given for
other properties. You might want to put the same image in all four
corners of an element and think you could do it like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-image: url(i/box-red.gif);
background-position: top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```

The result, however, would be to place a single red box in the top-left
corner of the element. To get images in all four corners, as shown in
[Figure 8-47](#ch08.xhtml_cab_fig60){data-type="xref"}, you'll have to
list the same image four times:[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797068006096
primary="" startref="ix_back_image_ch8" data-type="indexterm"}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

                  url(i/box-red.gif), url(i/box-red.gif);
background-position: top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```

It might seem a little out of place to talk about shadows in a chapter
mostly concerned with backgrounds, but you'll understand our reasoning
in a moment.

Let's consider a simple box drop shadow: one that's 10 pixels down and
10 pixels to the right of an element box, and a half-opaque black.
Behind it we'll put a repeating [background]{.keep-together} on the
`<body>` element. All of this is illustrated in
[Figure 8-48](#ch08.xhtml_Asimpleboxshadow){data-type="xref"} and
created with the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#box {background: silver; border: medium solid;
     box-shadow: 10px 10px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5);}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch08.xhtml_Asimpleboxshadow" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0848.png" width="600" height="140"
alt="css5 0848" />
<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_730"><span class="label">Figure 8-48.
</span>A simple box shadow</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We can see that the `<body>`'s background is visible through the
half-opaque (or half-transparent, if you prefer) drop shadow. Because no
blur or spread distances are defined, the drop shadow exactly mimics the
outer shape of the element box itself---at least it appears to do so.

The reason it only appears to mimic the shape of the box is that the
shadow is visible only outside the outer border edge of the element. We
couldn't really see that in the previous figure, because the element had
an opaque background. You might have just assumed that the shadow
extended all the way under the element, but it doesn't. Consider the
following, illustrated in
[Figure 8-49](#ch08.xhtml_Boxshadowsareincomplete){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#box {background: transparent; border: thin dashed;
     box-shadow: 10px 10px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5);}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch08.xhtml_Boxshadowsareincomplete" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch08.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_731"><span class="label">Figure 8-49.
</span>Box shadows are incomplete</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So it looks as though the element's content (and padding and border)
area "knocks out" part of the shadow. In truth, it's just that the
shadow was never drawn there, because of the way box shadows are defined
in the specification. This does mean, as
[Figure 8-49](#ch08.xhtml_Boxshadowsareincomplete){data-type="xref"}
demonstrates, that any background "behind" the box with a drop shadow
can be visible through the element itself. This (perhaps
bizarre-seeming) interaction with the backgrounds and borders is why
`box-shadow` is covered here, instead of at an earlier point in the
text.

So far, we've seen box shadows defined with two length values.
[]{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797067819264 primary="offsets"
secondary="box-shadow" data-type="indexterm"}The first defines a
horizontal offset, and the second a vertical offset. Positive numbers
move the shadow down and to the right, and negative numbers move the
shadow up and to the left.

If a []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797067817776 primary="blur radius"
secondary="box-shadow" data-type="indexterm"}third length is given, it
defines a blur distance, which determines how much space is given to
blurring. A fourth length defines a spread distance, which changes the
size of the shadow. Positive length values make the shadow expand before
blurring happens; negative values cause the shadow to shrink. The
following has the results shown in
[Figure 8-50](#ch08.xhtml_Variousblurredandspreadshadows){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.box:nth-of-type(1) {box-shadow: 1em 1em 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);}
.box:nth-of-type(2) {box-shadow: 2em 0.5em 0.25em rgba(128,0,0,0.5);}

</span>Various blurred and spread shadows</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You may have noticed that some of these boxes have rounded corners (via
`border-radius`), and that their shadows are curved to match. This is
the defined behavior, [fortunately.]{.keep-together}

We have yet to cover []{#ch08.xhtml_idm45797067696880
primary="inset keyword, box-shadow property" data-type="indexterm"}one
aspect of `box-shadow`, which is the `inset` keyword. If `inset` is
added to the value of `box-shadow`, the shadow is rendered inside the
box, as if the box were a punched-out hole in the canvas rather than
floating above it (visually speaking). Let's take the previous set of
examples and redo them with inset shadows. This will have the result
shown in
[Figure 8-51](#ch08.xhtml_Variousinsetshadows){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

Note that the `inset` keyword can appear before the rest of the value,
or after, but *not* in the middle of the lengths and colors. A value
like `0 0 0.1em inset gray` would be ignored as invalid because of the
placement of the `inset` keyword.

The last point to note is that you can apply to an element a list of as
many comma-separated box shadows as you like, just as with text shadows.
Some could be inset, and some outset. The following rules are just two
of the infinite possibilities:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

	padding: 20px;
	box-shadow: inset 0 -3em 3em rgb(0 0 0 /0.1),

```

Multiple shadows are drawn back to front, just as background layers are,
so the first shadow in the comma-separated list will be "on top" of all
the others. Consider the [following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
box-shadow: 0 0 0 5px red,
            0 0 0 10px blue,
            0 0 0 15px green;
```

The green is drawn first, then the blue on top of the green, and the red
drawn last, on top of the blue. While box shadows can be infinitely
wide, they do not contribute to the box model and take up no space.
Because of this, make sure to include enough space, especially if you're
doing large offsets or blur distances.

Adding backgrounds to elements, whether with colors or images, gives you
a great deal of power over the total visual presentation. The advantage
of CSS over older methods is that colors and backgrounds can be applied
to any element in a document, and manipulated in surprisingly complex
ways.

Three []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_grad_ch9 primary="gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}image types defined by CSS are described entirely
with CSS: linear gradients, radial gradients, and conic gradients. Each
type has two subtypes: repeating and nonrepeating. Gradients are most
often used in backgrounds, though they can be used in any context where
an image is permitted---as in `list-style-image` and `border-image`, for
example.

A *gradient* is a visual transition from one color to another. A
gradient from yellow to red will start yellow, run through successively
less yellow, redder shades of orange, and eventually arrive at a full
red. How gradual or abrupt the transition is depends on the amount of
space the gradient has and the way you define color stops and
progression color hints. If you run from white to black over 100 pixels,
each pixel along the gradient's default progression will be another 1%
darker gray, as shown in
[Figure 9-1](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig61){data-type="xref"}.

As we go through the process of exploring gradients, always keep this in
mind: *gradients are images*. It doesn't matter that you describe them
by typing CSS---they are every bit as much images as SVGs, PNGs, JPEGs,
and so on---but gradients have excellent rendering performance, don't
require an extra HTTP request to load, and are infinitely scalable.

What's []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797067121280 primary="gradients"
secondary="dimensions of" data-type="indexterm"}interesting about
gradients is that they have no intrinsic dimensions. If the
`background-size` property's value `auto` is used, it is treated as if
it were `100%`. Thus, if you don't define a `background-size` for a
background gradient, it will be set to the default value of `auto`,
which is the same as declaring `100% 100%`. So, by default, background
gradients fill the entire background positioning area. Just note that if
you offset the gradient's background position with a length (not
percentage) value, by default it will tile.

The first of these is the most basic that a gradient can be: two colors.
This causes a gradient from the first color at the top of the background
painting area to the second color at the bottom of the background
painting area.

By []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797067030272 primary="linear gradients"
secondary="direction of" data-type="indexterm"}default, a gradient runs
from top to bottom because the default direction for gradients is
`to bottom`, which is the same as `180deg` and its various equivalents
(for example, `0.5turn`). If you'd like to go in a different direction,
you can start the gradient value with a direction. That's what we did
for all the other gradients shown in
[Figure 9-2](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig62){data-type="xref"}.

They can be the same color, though. If you want to have a solid color
behind only part of your content, a gradient with the same color
declared twice, along with a background size and a no-repeat, enables
that, as shown in

The basic syntax of a linear gradient is shown here:

    linear-gradient(
        [[ <angle> | to <side-or-quadrant> ],]?
         [ <color-stop-list> [, <color-hint>]? ]# ,
        <color-stop-list>
    )

We'll explore both color stop lists and color hints soon. For now, the
basic pattern to keep in mind is an optional direction at the start, a
list of color stops and/or color hints, and a color stop at the end. As
shown earlier, a `linear-gradient()` value must have a minimum of two
color stops.

While you use the `to` keyword only if you're describing a side or
quadrant with keywords like `top` and `right`, the direction you give
*always* describes the direction in which the gradient line points. In
other words, `linear-gradient(0deg,red,green)` will have red at the
bottom and green at the top because the gradient line points toward 0
degrees (the top of the element) and thus ends with green. While it is
indeed "going toward 0 degrees," remember to omit the `to` if you're
using an angle value, because something like `to 45deg` is invalid and
will be ignored. Degrees increase clockwise from 0 at the top.

The important []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797066866960
primary="units of measure" secondary="with linear gradients"
secondary-sortas="linear gradients" data-type="indexterm"}point is that
while `0deg` is the same as `to top`, 45% is *not* the same as
`to top right`. This is explained in ["Understanding Gradient Lines: The
Gory
Details"](#ch09.xhtml_gradient-lines-the-gory-details){data-type="xref"}.
Equally important to remember is that when using angles, whether it's
degrees, radians, or turns, the unit type is *required*. A `0` value is
not valid and will prevent any gradient from being created, while `0deg`
is valid.

## Setting Gradient Colors {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_740}

You can use any []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797066859648

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797066858640
primary="transparent backgrounds" data-type="indexterm"}color value you
like in gradients, including alpha-channel values such as `rgba()` and
keywords like `transparent`. Thus it's entirely possible to fade out
pieces of your gradient by blending to (or from) a color with zero
opacity. Consider the following rules, which are depicted in
[Figure 9-4](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig63){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#ex01 {background-image:
    linear-gradient( to right, rgb(200,200,200), rgb(255,255,255) );}
#ex02 {background-image:
    linear-gradient( to right, rgba(200,200,200,1), rgba(200,200,200,0) );}
```

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_741"><span class="label">Figure 9-4.
</span>Fading to white versus fading to transparent</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The first example fades from light gray to white, whereas the second
example fades the same light gray from opaque to transparent, thus
allowing the parent element's yellow background to show through.

You're not restricted to two colors, either. While that is the minimum
number of colors allowed, you're free to add as many colors as you can
stand. Consider the following [gradient:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#wdim {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
    red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,
    red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet
    );
```

The gradient line points toward 90 degrees, which is the right side.
There are 14 color stops in all, one for each of the comma-separated
color names, and they are, by default, distributed evenly along the
gradient line, with the first at the beginning of the line and the last
at the end. Between the color stops, by default the colors are blended
as smoothly as possible from one color to the other. This is shown in
[Figure 9-5](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig64){data-type="xref"}, with extra labels
indicating how far along the gradient line the color stops are placed.

<figure>

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_742"><span class="label">Figure 9-5.
</span>The distribution of color stops along the gradient line</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So, without any indication of where the color stops should be
positioned, they're evenly distributed. Fortunately, we can give each
color up to two positions, and can even use color hints for more control
over gradient progression, hopefully improving the visual effect.

primary="gradients" secondary="color stops" data-type="indexterm"} full
syntax of a \<*`color-stop`*\> is as follows:

    [<color>] [ <length> | <percentage> ]{1,2}?

After every color value, you can (but don't have to) supply a position
value or two. This gives you the ability to distort the default evenly
distributed progression of color stops into something else.

We'll start with lengths, since they're pretty simple. Let's take a
rainbow progression (only a single rainbow this time) and have each
color of the rainbow occur every 25 pixels, as shown in
[Figure 9-6](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig65){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
               red, orange 25px, yellow 50px, green 75px,
               blue 100px, indigo 125px, violet 150px)};
```

<figure>

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_744"><span class="label">Figure 9-6.
</span>Placing color stops every 25 pixels</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This worked out just fine, but notice what happens after 150
pixels---the violet just continues on to the end of the gradient line.
That's what happens if you set up the color stops so they don't make it
to the end of a basic gradient line: the last color is just carried
onward.

Conversely, if your color stops go beyond the end of a basic gradient
line, the gradient will appear to stop at whatever point it manages to
reach when it gets to the end of the visible part of the gradient line.
This is illustrated in
[Figure 9-7](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig66){data-type="xref"}, created with the
following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
               red, orange 200px, yellow 400px, green 600px,
               blue 800px, indigo 1000px, violet 1200px)};
```

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig66" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0907.png" width="600" height="91"

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_745"><span class="label">Figure 9-7.
</span>Gradient clipping when color stops go too far</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Since the last color stop is at 1,200 pixels but the background size
isn't nearly that wide, the visible part of the gradient stops right
around the color `blue`.

Note that in the preceding two examples and figures, the first color
(`red`) doesn't have a length value. If the first color has no position,
it's assumed to be the beginning of the gradient line, as if `0%` (or
other zero value, like `0px`) had been declared. Similarly, if you leave
a position off the last color stop, it's assumed to be the end of the
gradient line. (But note that this is not true for repeating gradients,
which we'll cover in ["Repeating Linear
Gradients"](#ch09.xhtml_repeating-linear-gradients){data-type="xref"}.)

You can use any length value you like, not just pixels---ems, viewport
units, you name it. You can even mix different units into the same
gradient, although this is not generally recommended for reasons we'll
get to in a little bit. You can also have negative length values if you
want; doing so will place a color stop before the beginning of the
gradient line, all the color transitions will happen as expected, and
clipping will occur in the same manner as it happens at the end of the
line. The following code, for example, results in
[Figure 9-8](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig67){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
               red -200px, orange 200px, yellow 400px, green 600px,
               blue 800px, indigo 1000px, violet 1200px)};
```

</span>Gradient clipping when color stops have negative positions</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As for percentages, they're calculated with respect to the total length
of the gradient line. A color stop at `50%` will be at the midpoint of
the gradient line. Let's return to our rainbow example, and instead of
having a color stop every 25 pixels, we'll have one every 10% of the
gradient line's length. This would look like the following, which has
the result shown in
[Figure 9-9](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig68){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
    red, orange 10%, yellow 20%, green 30%, blue 40%, indigo 50%, violet 60%)};
```

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig68" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0909.png" width="600" height="96"

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_747"><span class="label">Figure 9-9.
</span>Placing color stops every 10%</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As you saw previously, since the last color stop comes before the end of
the gradient line, its color (`violet`) is carried through to the end of
the gradient. These stops are more spread out than in the earlier
25-pixel example, but otherwise things happen in more or less the same
way.

If some color stops have position values and others don't, the stops
without positions are evenly distributed between the ones that do. The
following are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
  red, orange, yellow 50%, green, blue, indigo 95%, violet)};

#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
  red 0%, orange 25%, yellow 50%, green 65%, blue 80%, indigo 95%, violet 100%)};
```

Because `red` and `violet` don't have specified position values, they're
taken to be `0%` and `100%`, respectively. This means that `orange`,
`green`, and `blue` will be evenly distributed between the explicitly
defined positions to either side of them.

For `orange`, that means the point midway between `red 0%` and
`yellow 50%`, which is 25%. For `green` and `blue`, these need to be
arranged between `yellow 50%` and `indigo 95%`. That's a 45% difference,
which is divided in three, because there are three intervals between the
four values. That means 65% and 80%.

You might wonder what happens if you put two color stops at exactly the
same point, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
    red 0%, orange, yellow 50%, green 50%, blue , indigo, violet)};
```

All that happens is the two color stops are put on top of each other.
[Figure 9-10](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig70){data-type="xref"} shows the result.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig70" class="figure">

The []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797063636704
primary="“hard” color stops, linear gradients"
primary-sortas="hard color stops, linear gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}gradient blends as usual all along the gradient
line, but at the 50% point, it instantly blends from yellow to green
over zero length, creating what's often called a *hard* color stop. So
the gradient blends from orange at the 25% point (halfway between 0% to
50%) to yellow at the 50% point, then blends from yellow to green over
zero length, then blends from green at 50% over to blue at 66.67%
(one-third of the way between 50% and 100%).

This hard-stop effect can be useful if you want to create a striped
effect. The following code results in the stripes shown in
[Figure 9-11](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig71){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.stripes {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
    gray 0%, gray 25%,
    transparent 25%, transparent 50%,
    gray 50%, gray 75%,
    transparent 75%, transparent 100%);}
```

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_749"><span class="label">Figure 9-11.
</span>Hard-stop stripes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

That said, there's an easier and more readable way to do that kind of
thing, which is to give each color a starting and ending stop position.
Here's how to do that, with exactly the same result as shown in
[Figure 9-11](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig71){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.stripes {background-image:
	linear-gradient(90deg,
		gray 0% 25%,
		transparent 25% 50%,
		gray 50% 75%,
		transparent 75% 100%);}
```

Note that the `0%` and `100%` could have been left out, and they'd be
inferred by the browser. So you can leave them in for clarity or take
them out for efficiency, as suits you.

It's also fine to mix two-stop stripes and one-stop color points in a
single gradient. If you want to have the first and last quarter of the
gradient be solid gray stripes and transition through transparency
between them, it could look like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.stripes {background-image:
	linear-gradient(90deg,
		gray 0% 25%,
		transparent 50%,
		gray 75% 100%);}
```

OK, so that's what happens if you put color stops right on top of each
other, but what happens if you put one *before* the other? Something
like this, say:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
    red 0%, orange, yellow, green 50%, blue 40%, indigo, violet)};
```

The offending color stop (blue, in this case) is set to the largest
specified value of a preceding color stop. Here, it is set to `50%`,
since the stop before it has that position. This creates a hard stop,
and we get the same effect we saw earlier, when the green and blue color
stops were placed on top of each other.

The key point here is that the color stop is set to the largest
*specified* position of the stop that precedes it. Thus, the following
two gradients are visually the same, as the `indigo` color stop in the
first gets set to `50%`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
    red 0%, orange, yellow 50%, green, blue, indigo 33%, violet)};

#spectrum {background-image: linear-gradient(90deg,
    red 0%, orange, yellow 50%, indigo 50%, violet)};
```

In this case, the largest specified position before the indigo stop is
the `50%` specified at the yellow stop. Thus, the gradient fades from
red to orange to yellow, then has a hard switch to indigo before fading
from indigo to violet. The green and blue aren't skipped; rather, the
gradients transition from yellow to green to blue to indigo over zero
distance. See [Figure 9-12](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig72){data-type="xref"} for
the results.

This behavior is the reason mixing units within a single gradient is
generally discouraged. If you mix `rem` units and percentages, for
example, your color stop positioned with percentages might end up before
an earlier color stop positioned with

## Setting Color Hints {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_751}

Thus far, we've worked with []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_lin_grad_color_hint
primary="linear gradients" secondary="color hints"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_color_hint_lin_grad
primary="color hints, for linear gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_grad_color_hint
primary="gradients" secondary="color hints" data-type="indexterm"}color
stops, but you may remember that the syntax for linear gradients permits
color hints after each color stop:

    linear-gradient(
        [[ <angle> | to <side-or-quadrant> ],]?
         [ <color-stop-list> [, <color-hint>]? ]# ,
        <color-stop-list>
    )

A \<*`color-hint`*\> is a way of modifying the blend between the two
color stops to either side. By default, the blend from one color stop to
the next is linear, with the midpoint of the blend at the halfway mark
between two color stops, or 50%. It doesn't have to be that simple. The
following two gradients are the same and have the result shown in
[Figure 9-13](#ch09.xhtml_cbag_css4_gradient-color-hints-default){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
linear-gradient(

)
linear-gradient(
    to right, rgb(0% 0% 0%) 25%, 50%, rgb(90% ,90% ,90%) 75%
)
```

</div>
</figure>

With color hints, we can change the midpoint of the progression. Instead
of reaching `rgb(45% 45% 45%)` at the halfway point, it can be set for
any point between the two stops. Thus, the following CSS leads to the
result seen in
[Figure 9-14](#ch09.xhtml_cbag_css4_gradient-color-hints-various){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

</span>Black to gray with differing midpoint hints</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In all five examples, the first color stop is at the 25% mark and the
last at the 75% mark, but each has a different midpoint for the
gradient. In the first case (`#ex01`), the default linear progression is
used, with the middle color (45% black) occurring at the midpoint
between the two color stops.

In the second case (`#ex02`), the middle color happens at the 33% point
of the gradient line. So the first color stop is at the 25% point on the
line, the middle color happens at 33%, and the second color stop happens
at 75%.

In the third example (`#ex03`), the midpoint is at the 67% point of the
gradient line; thus, the color fades from black at 25% to the middle
color at 67%, and then from that middle color at 67% to light gray at
75%.

The fourth and fifth examples show what happens when you put a color
hint's distance right on top of one of the color stops: you get a hard
stop.

The interesting point about color hinting is that the progression from
color stop to color hint to color stop is not just a set of two linear
progressions. Instead, the progression has some "curving," in order to
ease from one side of the color hint to the other. (The exact curve is
logarithmic and based on the gradient-progression equation used by
Photoshop.) This is easiest to see by comparing what would seem to be,
but actually is not, two gradients that do the same thing. As you can
see in
[Figure 9-15](#ch09.xhtml_cbag_css4_gradient-color-hints-curve){data-type="xref"},
the result is rather different for these two examples:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#ex01 {background:
    linear-gradient(to right,
        rgb(0% 0% 0%) 25%,
        rgb(45% 45% 45%) 67%,   /* this is a color stop */
        rgb(90% 90% 90%) 75%);}
#ex02 {background:
    linear-gradient(to right,
        rgb(0% 0% 0%) 25%,
        67%,                    /* this is a color hint */
        rgb(90% 90% 90%) 75%);}
```

Notice how the gray progression differs in the two examples. The first
shows a linear progression from black to `rgb(45%,45%,45%)`, and then
another linear progression from there to `rgb(90%,90%,90%)`. The second
progresses from black to light gray over the same distance, and the
color-hint point is at the 67% mark, but the gradient is altered to
attempt a smoother overall progression. The colors at 25%, 67%, and 75%
are the same in both examples, but all the other shades along the way
are different because of the (somewhat complicated) easing algorithm
defined in the CSS specifications.

## Understanding Gradient Lines: The Gory Details {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_756}

Now that you have a grasp of the basics of
[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_lin_grad_grad_line primary="linear gradients"
secondary="gradient lines"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_grad_line_ch9
primary="gradient lines" data-type="indexterm"}placing color stops,
let's look closely at how gradient lines are constructed, and thus how
they create the effects that they do. First, let's set up a simple
gradient so we can then dissect how it works:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
linear-gradient(
    55deg, #4097FF, #FFBE00, #4097FF
)
```

Now, how does this one-dimensional construct---a line at 55 degrees on
the compass---create a two-dimensional gradient fill? First, the
gradient line is placed and its start and ending points determined. This
is diagrammed in [Figure 9-16](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig73){data-type="xref"},
with the final gradient shown next to it.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig73" class="figure">

alt="css5 0916" />
<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_757"><span class="label">Figure 9-16.
</span>The placement and sizing of the gradient line</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The first point to make very clear is that the box seen here is not an
element---it's the linear-gradient image itself. (Remember, we're
creating images here.) The size and shape of that image can depend on a
lot of factors, whether it's the size of the element's background or the
application of properties like `background-size`, which is a topic we'll
cover in a bit. For now, we're just concentrating on the image itself.

So, in [Figure 9-16](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig73){data-type="xref"}, you can
see that the gradient line goes straight through the center of the
image. The gradient line *always* goes through the center of the
gradient image, and in this case, the gradient image is centered in the
background area. (Using `background-position` to shift placement of a
gradient image can, in some cases, make it appear that the center of the
gradient is not centered in the image, but it is.) This gradient is set
to a 55-degree angle, so it's pointing at 55 degrees on the compass.
What's interesting is the start and ending points of the gradient line,
which are actually outside the image.

Let's talk about the starting point first. It's the point on the
gradient line where a line perpendicular to the gradient line intersects
with the corner of the image farthest away from the gradient line's
direction (`55deg`). Conversely, the gradient line's ending point is the
point on the gradient line where a perpendicular line intersects the
corner of the image nearest to the gradient line's direction.

Bear in mind that the terms "starting point" and "ending point" are a
little bit [misleading---the]{.keep-together} gradient line doesn't
actually stop at either point. The gradient line is, in fact, infinite.
However, the starting point is where the first color stop will be placed
by default, as it corresponds to position value `0%`. Similarly, the
ending point corresponds to the position value `100%`.

Therefore, let's consider the gradient we defined before:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
linear-gradient(
    55deg, #4097FF, #FFBE00, #4097FF
)
```

The color at the starting point will be `#4097FF`, the color at the
midpoint (which is also the center of the gradient image) will be
`#FFBE00`, and the color at the ending point will be `#4097FF`, with
smooth blending in between. This is illustrated in
[Figure 9-17](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig74){data-type="xref"}.

</span>The calculation of color along the gradient line</h6>
</div>
</figure>

All right, fine so far. But, you may wonder, how do the bottom-left and
top-right corners of the image get set to the same blue that's
calculated for the starting and ending points, if those points are
outside the image? Because the color at each point along the gradient
line is extended out perpendicularly from the gradient line. This is
partially shown in
[Figure 9-18](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig75){data-type="xref"} by extending
perpendicular lines at the starting and ending points, as well as every
5% of the gradient line between them. Note that each line perpendicular
to the gradient line is a solid color.

</span>The extension of selected colors along the gradient line</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Hopefully, that should be enough to let you mentally fill in the rest,
so let's consider what happens to the gradient image in various other
settings. We'll use the same gradient definition as before, but this
time apply it to wide, square, and tall images. These are shown in
[Figure 9-19](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig76){data-type="xref"}. Note that the
starting-point and ending-point colors always make their way into the
corners of the gradient image.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig76" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0919.png" width="600" height="223"

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_760"><span class="label">Figure 9-19.
</span>How gradients are constructed for various images</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note that we very carefully said "the starting-point and ending-point
colors," and did *not* say "the starting and ending colors." That's
because, as you saw earlier, color stops can be placed before the
starting point and after the ending point, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
linear-gradient(
    55deg, #4097FF -25%, #FFBE00, #4097FF 125%
)
```

The placement of these color stops, the starting and ending points, the
way the colors are calculated along the gradient line, and the final
gradient are all shown in
[Figure 9-20](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig77){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig77" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0920.png" width="600" height="230"

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_761"><span class="label">Figure 9-20.
</span>A gradient with stops beyond the starting and ending points</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Once again, we see that the colors in the bottom-left and top-right
corners match the starting-point and ending-point colors. It's just that
in this case, since the first color stop comes before the starting
point, the actual color at the starting point is a blend of the first
and second color stops. Likewise for the ending point, which is a blend
of the second and third color stops.

Now here's where things get a little bit wacky. Remember how you can use
directional keywords, like `top` and `right`, to indicate the direction
of the gradient line? Suppose you want the gradient line to go toward
the top right, so you create a gradient image like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
linear-gradient(
    to top right, #4097FF -25%, #FFBE00, #4097FF 125%
)
```

This does *not* cause the gradient line to intersect with the top-right
corner. If only that were so! Instead, what happens is a good deal
stranger. First, let's diagram it in
[Figure 9-21](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig78){data-type="xref"} so that we have
something to refer to.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig78" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0921.png" width="600" height="500"
alt="css5 0921" />
<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_762"><span class="label">Figure 9-21.
</span>A gradient headed toward the top right</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Your eyes do not deceive you: the gradient line is way off from the
top-right corner. It *is* headed into the top-right quadrant of the
image, though. That's what `to top right` really means: head into the
top-right quadrant of the image, not into the top-right corner.

As [Figure 9-21](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig78){data-type="xref"} shows, the way
to find out exactly what that means is to do the following:

1.  Draw a line from the midpoint of the image into the corners adjacent
    to the corner in the quadrant that's been declared. Thus, for the
    top-right quadrant, the adjacent corners are the top left and bottom
    right.

2.  Find the center point of that line, which is the center point of the
    image, and draw the gradient line perpendicular to that line,
    through the center point, pointing into the declared quadrant.

3.  Construct the gradient---that is, determine the starting and ending
    points, place or distribute the color stops along the gradient line,
    and then calculate the entire gradient image, as per usual.

This process has a few interesting side effects. First, the color at the
midpoint will always stretch from one quadrant-adjacent corner to the
other. Second, if the image's shape changes---that is, if its aspect
ratio changes---the gradient line will also reset its direction,
reorienting slightly to fit the new aspect ratio. So watch out for that
if you have flexible elements. Third, a perfectly square gradient image
will have a gradient line that intersects with a corner.
[Figure 9-22](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig79){data-type="xref"} depicts examples
of these three side effects, using the following gradient definition in
all three cases:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
linear-gradient(
    to top right, purple, green 49.5%, black 50%, green 50.5%, gold
)
```

</span>Examples of the side effects of a quadrant-directed gradient</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Sadly, there is no way to say "point the gradient line into the corner
of a nonsquare image," short of calculating the necessary degree heading
yourself and declaring it explicitly, a process that will most likely
require JavaScript unless you know the image will always be an exact
size in all cases, forever. (Or use the `aspect-ratio` property; see
[Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"}
for details.)

While linear gradients follow a gradient line in the direction set forth
by the angle, it is possible to create a mirrored gradient; for that,
oddly enough, see ["Radial

secondary="gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_lin_grad_repeat

data-type="indexterm"}gradients are autosized by default, matching the
size of the background area to which they are applied. In other words,
by default a gradient image takes up all the available background space
and does not repeat.

Intentionally setting a background size and tiling images, especially
with hard color stops, can create interesting effects. By declaring two
linear-gradient background images using hard color stops, with
perpendicular gradient lines, and different background colors, you can
create picnic tablecloth effects for any place setting by setting up
some gradient images, tiling them, and then putting a color underneath,
as illustrated in

Instead of defining a gradient size with `background-size` and tiling it
with `background-repeat`, we can use repeating linear gradient syntax.
By adding `repeating` in front of the linear gradients, they are made
infinitely repeating within the size of the gradient. In other words,
the declared color stops and color hints are repeated on a loop along
the gradient line, over and over again, because the size of a gradient
line when using `repeating-linear-gradient` is the size of the last
color stop position less the first color stop position (in this case,
`2vw`). Thus, we can remove the sizing and repetition properties, as in
the following, and get the same result shown in
[Figure 9-23](#ch09.xhtml_linear-gradients-tablecloth-regular){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
   background-image:
     repeating-linear-gradient(to top,
        transparent 0 1vw, rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2) 1vw 2vw),
     repeating-linear-gradient(to right,
        transparent 0 1vw, rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2) 1vw 2vw);
}
div.fruit {background-color: papayawhip;}
div.grain {background-color: palegoldenrod;}
div.fishy {background-color: salmon;}
```

This is nice for simple patterns like these tablecloths, but it comes in
really handy for more complex situations. For example, if you declare
the following nonrepeating gradient, you end up with discontinuity where
the image repeats, as shown in
[Figure 9-24](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig96){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

You *could* try to nail down the exact sizes of the element and gradient
image and then mess with the construction of the gradient image to try
to make the sides line up, but it would be a lot easier to do the
following, with the result shown in
[Figure 9-25](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig97){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

</span>A repeating gradient image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note that the last color stop ends with an explicit length (`50px`).
This is important to do with repeating gradients, because the length
value(s) of the last color stop defines the overall length of the
pattern. If you leave off an ending stop, it will default to 100%, which
is the end of the gradient line.

If you're using smoother transitions, you need to be careful that the
color value at the last color stop matches the color value at the first
color stop. Consider this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
repeating-linear-gradient(-45deg, purple 0px, gold 50px)
```

This will produce a smooth gradient from purple to gold at 50 pixels,
and then a hard switch back to purple and another 50-pixel
purple-to-gold blend. By adding one more color stop with the same color
as the first color stop, the gradient can be smoothed out to avoid
hard-stop lines:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
repeating-linear-gradient(-45deg, purple 0px, gold 50px, purple 100px)
```

See [Figure 9-26](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig98){data-type="xref"} for a
comparison of the two approaches.

</span>Dealing with hard resets in repeating-gradient images</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You may have noticed that none of the repeating gradients so far have a
defined size. That means the images are defaulting in size to the full
background positioning area of the element to which they're applied, per
the default behavior for images that have no intrinsic height and width.

If you resize a repeating-gradient image by using `background-size`, the
gradient would repeat only within the bounds of the gradient image. If
you then repeated that image using `background-repeat`, you could easily
be back to having discontinuities in your background.

If you use percentages in your repeating linear gradients, they'll be
placed the same as if the gradient wasn't of the repeating variety. Then
again, this would mean that all of the gradients defined by those color
stops would be seen and none of the repetitions would be visible, so
percentages tend to be kind of pointless with repeating linear
gradients.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062202912 primary=""

Linear []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_grad_rad_grad_ch9 primary="gradients"
secondary="radial" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_rad_grad_ch9
primary="radial gradients" data-type="indexterm"}gradients are pretty
awesome, but at times you really want a circular gradient. You can use
such a gradient to create a spotlight effect, a circular shadow, a
rounded glow, or any number of other effects, including a reflected
gradient. []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062179904 primary="radial gradients"
secondary="radial-gradient() function" data-type="indexterm"}The syntax
used is similar to that for linear gradients, but some interesting
differences exist:

    radial-gradient(
        [ [ <shape> ‖ <size> ] [ at <position>]? , | at <position>, ]?
          [ <color-stop-list> [, <color-hint>]? ] [, <color-stop-list> ]+
    )

What this []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062174880 primary="radial gradients"
secondary="colors in" data-type="indexterm"}boils down to is you can
optionally declare a shape and size, optionally declare where the center
of the gradient is positioned, and then declare two or more color stops
with optional color hints between the stops. Interesting options are
available in the shape and size bits, so let's build up to those.

First, let's look at a simple radial gradient---the simplest possible,
in fact---presented in a variety of differently shaped elements
([Figure 9-27](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig80){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.radial {background-image: radial-gradient(purple, gold);}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig80" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_770"><span class="label">Figure 9-27.
</span>A simple radial gradient in multiple settings</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In all of these cases, because no position is declared, the default of
`center` is used, and the default ellipse has the same aspect ratio as
the image size. Because no shape is declared, the shape is an ellipse
for all cases but the square element; in that case, the shape is a
circle. Finally, because no color-stop or color-hint positions are
declared, the first is placed at the beginning of the gradient ray, and
the last at the end, with a linear blend from one to the other.

That's right: the *gradient ray* is the []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062147088
primary="radial gradients" secondary="gradient rays"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062146080
primary="gradient ray" data-type="indexterm"}radial equivalent of the
gradient line in linear gradients. It extends outward from the center of
the gradient directly to the right, and the rest of the gradient is
constructed from it. (We'll get to the details in just a bit.)

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Setting Shape and Size" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch09.xhtml_shape-and-size .sect2}
## Setting Shape and Size {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_771}

First off, a []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062142816 primary="radial gradients"
secondary="shape of"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_rad_grad_size
primary="radial gradients" secondary="size of"
data-type="indexterm"}radial gradient has exactly two possible shape
values (and thus two possible shapes): `circle` and `ellipse`. The shape
of a gradient can be declared explicitly or can be implied by the way
you size the gradient image.

So, on to sizing. As always, the simplest way to size a radial gradient
is with either one nonnegative length (if you're sizing a circle) or two
nonnegative lengths (if it's an ellipse). Say you have this radial
gradient:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(50px, purple, gold)
```

This creates a circular radial gradient that fades from purple at the
center to gold at a distance of 50 pixels from the center. If we add
another length, the shape becomes an ellipse that's as wide as the first
length and as tall as the second length:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(50px 100px, purple, gold)
```

[Figure 9-28](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig81){data-type="xref"} shows these two
gradients.

<figure class="width-50">
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig81" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0928.png" width="600" height="285"
alt="css5 0928" />
<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_772"><span class="label">Figure 9-28.
</span>Simple radial gradients</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the shape of the gradients has nothing to do with the
overall size and shape of the images in which they appear. If you make a
gradient a circle, it will be a circle, even if it's inside a
rectangular gradient image. So too will an ellipse always be an ellipse,
even when inside a square gradient image.

You can also use percentage values for the size, but *only* for
ellipses. Circles cannot be given percentage sizes because there's no
way to indicate the axis to which that percentage refers. (Imagine an
image 100 pixels tall by 500 wide. Should `10%` mean 10 pixels or 50
pixels?) If you try to provide percentage values for a circle, the
entire declaration will fail because of the invalid value.

If you do supply percentages to an ellipse, then as usual, the first
refers to the horizontal axis and the second to the vertical. The
following gradient is shown in various settings in
[Figure 9-29](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig82){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(50% 25%, purple, gold)
```

<figure>

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_773"><span class="label">Figure 9-29.
</span>Percentage-sized elliptical gradients</h6>
</div>
</figure>

When it comes to ellipses, you're also able to mix lengths and
percentages, with the usual caveat to be careful. So if you're feeling
confident, you can absolutely make an elliptical radial gradient 10
pixels tall and half the element width, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(50% 10px, purple, gold)
```

As it happens, lengths and percentages aren't the only way to size
radial gradients. []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062037040
primary="radial gradients" secondary="gradient rays"
data-type="indexterm"}In addition to those value types, four keywords
are available for sizing radial gradients, the effects of which are
summarized here:

`closest-side`

:   If the []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797062034272
    primary="closest-side keyword, radial gradients"
    data-type="indexterm"}radial gradient's shape is a circle, the
    gradient is sized so that the end of the gradient ray exactly
    touches the edge of the gradient image that is closest to the center
    point of the radial gradient. If the shape is an ellipse, the end of
    the gradient ray exactly touches the closest edge in each of the
    horizontal and vertical axes.

`farthest-side`

:   If the []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061998576
    primary="farthest-side keyword, radial gradients"
    data-type="indexterm"}radial gradient's shape is a circle, the
    gradient is sized so that the end of the gradient ray exactly
    touches the edge of the gradient image that is farthest from the
    center point of the radial gradient. If the shape is an ellipse, the
    end of the gradient ray exactly touches the farthest edge in each of
    the horizontal and vertical axes.

`closest-corner`

:   If the []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061996336
    primary="closest-corner keyword, radial gradients"
    data-type="indexterm"}radial gradient's shape is a circle, the
    gradient is sized so that the end of the gradient ray exactly
    touches the corner of the gradient image that is closest to the
    center point of the radial gradient. If the shape is an ellipse, the
    end of the gradient ray still touches the corner closest to the
    center, *and* the ellipse has the same aspect ratio that it would
    have had if `closest-side` had been specified.

`farthest-corner` (default)

:   If the []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061993072
    primary="farthest-corner keyword, radial gradients"
    data-type="indexterm"}radial gradient's shape is a circle, the
    gradient is sized so that the end of the gradient ray exactly
    touches the corner of the gradient image that is farthest from the
    center point of the radial gradient. If the shape is an ellipse, the
    end of the gradient ray still touches the corner farthest from the
    center, *and* the ellipse has the same aspect ratio that it would
    have had if `farthest-side` had been specified. Note: this is the
    default size value for a radial gradient and so is used if no size
    values are declared.

To better visualize the results of each keyword, see
[Figure 9-30](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig83){data-type="xref"}, which depicts
each keyword applied as both a circle and an ellipse.

These keywords cannot be mixed with lengths or percentages in elliptical
radial gradients; thus, `closest-side 25px` is invalid and will be
ignored.

Something you might have noticed in
[Figure 9-30](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig83){data-type="xref"} is that the
gradients didn't start at the center of the image. That's because they
were positioned elsewhere, which is the topic of the next
section.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061985488 primary=""

## Positioning Radial Gradients {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_775}

If you want to shift the []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_position_rad_grad
primary="positioning" secondary="gradient"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_rad_grad_position
primary="radial gradients" secondary="positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}center of a radial gradient away from the default
of `center`, you can do so using any position value that would be valid
for `background-position`. We're not going to reproduce that rather
complicated syntax here; flip back to ["Positioning Background
Images"](../Text/ch08.xhtml#background-positioning){data-type="xref"} if
you need a refresher.

When we say "any position value that would be valid," that means any
permitted combination of lengths, percentages, keywords, and so on. It
also means that if you leave off one of the two position values, it will
be inferred just the same as for `background-position`. So, just for one
example, `center` is equivalent to `center center`. The one major
difference between radial gradient positions and background positions is
the default: for radial gradients, the default position is `center`, not
`0% 0%`.

To give an idea of the possibilities, consider the following rules,
illustrated in [Figure 9-31](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig84){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(at bottom left, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(at center right, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(at 30px 30px, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(at 25% 66%, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(at 30px 66%, purple, gold);

</div>
</figure>

None of those positioned radial gradients are explicitly sized, so they
all default to `farthest-corner`. That's a reasonable guess at the
intended default behavior, but it's not the only possibility. Let's mix
some sizes into these gradients and find out how that changes things (as
depicted in [Figure 9-32](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig85){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(30px at bottom left, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(30px 15px at center right, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(50% 15% at 30px 30px, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(farthest-side at 25% 66%, purple, gold);
radial-gradient(closest-corner at 30px 66%, purple, gold);

primary="color stops" secondary="radial gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_grad_color_stop2
primary="gradients" secondary="color stops" data-type="indexterm"}stops
for radial gradients have the same syntax as, and work in a similar
fashion to, linear gradients. Let's return to the simplest possible
radial gradient and follow it with a more explicit equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(purple, gold);
radial-gradient(purple 0%, gold 100%);
```

So the gradient ray extends out from the center point. At 0% (the start
point, and also the center of the gradient), the ray will be purple. At
100% (the ending point), the ray will be gold. Between the two stops is
a smooth blend from purple to gold; beyond the ending point is solid
gold.

If we add a stop between purple and gold, but don't give it a position,
the stop will be placed midway between the two colors, and the blending
will be altered accordingly, as shown in
[Figure 9-33](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig86){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(100px circle at center, purple 0%, green, gold 100%);
```

<figure>

</span>Adding a color stop</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We'd have gotten the same result if we'd added `green 50%` there, but
you get the idea. The gradient ray's color goes smoothly from purple to
green to gold, and then is solid gold beyond that point on the ray.

This illustrates one difference between gradient lines (for linear
gradients) and gradient rays: a linear gradient is derived by extending
the color perpendicularly at each point along the gradient line. A
similar behavior occurs with a radial gradient, except instead of the
lines that come off the gradient ray, ellipses are created; these are
scaled-up or scaled-down versions of the ellipse at the ending point.
[Figure 9-34](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig87){data-type="xref"} illustrates a
gradient ray and the ellipses that are drawn at various points along it.

<figure>

</span>The gradient ray and some of the ellipses it spawns</h6>
</div>
</figure>

That brings up an interesting question: how is the ending point (the
`100%` point, if you like) determined for each gradient ray? It's the
point where the gradient ray intersects with the shape described by the
size. For a circle, that's easy: the gradient ray's ending point is
however far from the center that the size value
[indicates.]{.keep-together} So for a `25px circle` gradient, the ending
point of the ray is 25 pixels from the center.

For an ellipse, it's essentially the same operation, except that the
distance from the center is dependent on the horizontal axis of the
ellipse. Given a radial gradient that's a `40px 20px ellipse`, the
ending point will be 40 pixels from the center and directly to its
right. [Figure 9-35](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig88){data-type="xref"} shows this
in some detail.

</div>
</figure>

Another []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_rad_grad_colors primary="radial gradients"
secondary="colors in" data-type="indexterm"}difference between linear
gradient lines and radial gradient rays is that you can see beyond the
ending point. As you may recall, a linear gradient line is always drawn
so that you can see the colors at the 0% and 100% points, but nothing
beyond them; the gradient line can never be any smaller than the longest
axis of the gradient image and will frequently be longer than that. With
a radial gradient, on the other hand, you can size the radial shape to
be smaller than the total gradient image. In that case, the color at the
last color stop is extended outward from the ending point. (You've
already seen this in several previous figures.)

Conversely, if you set a color stop that's beyond the ending point of a
ray, you might get to see the color out to that stop. Consider the
following gradient, illustrated in

</span>Color stops beyond the ending point</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The first color stop has no position, so it's set to `0%`, which is the
center point. The last color stop is set to `80px`, so it will be 80
pixels away from the center in all directions. The middle color stop,
`green`, is placed midway between the two (40 pixels from the center).
So we get a gradient that goes out to gold at 80 pixels and then
continues gold beyond that point.

This happens even though the circle is explicitly set to be 50 pixels
large. It still is 50 pixels in radius; it's just that the positioning
of the last color stop makes that fact vaguely irrelevant. Visually, we
might as well have declared this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(80px circle at center, purple, green, gold)
```

Or, more simply, just this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(80px, purple, green, gold)
```

The same behaviors apply if you use percentages for your color stops.
These are equivalent to the previous examples, and to each other,
visually speaking:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(50px, purple, green, gold 160%)
radial-gradient(80px, purple, green, gold 100%)
```

Now, what if you set a negative position for a color stop? The result is
pretty much the same as for linear gradient lines: the negative color
stop is used to figure out the color at the starting point but is
otherwise unseen. Thus, the following gradient will have the result
shown in [Figure 9-37](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig90){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(80px, purple -40px, green, gold)
```

</span>Handling a negative color-stop position</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Given these color-stop positions, the first color stop is at `-40px`,
the last is at `80px` (because, given its lack of an explicit position,
it defaults to the ending point), and the middle is placed midway
between them. The result is the same as if we'd explicitly used this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(80px, purple -40px, green 20px, gold 80px)
```

That's why the color at the center of the gradient is a green-purple:
it's a blend of one-third purple, two-thirds green. From there, it
blends the rest of the way to green, and then on to gold. The rest of
the purple-green blend, the part that sits on the "negative space" of
the gradient ray, is invisible.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061399264

## Handling Degenerate Cases {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_784}

Given that we can []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_zero_size_rad_grad
primary="zero size situation, radial gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_rad_grad_degen
primary="radial gradients" secondary="degenerate (edge) cases"
data-type="indexterm"}declare size and position for a radial gradient,
the question arises: what if a circular gradient has zero radius, or an
elliptical gradient has zero height or width? These conditions aren't
quite as hard to create as you might think. Besides explicitly declaring
that a radial gradient has zero size using `0px` or `0%`, you could also
do something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(closest-corner circle at top right, purple, gold)
```

The gradient's size is set to `closest-corner`, and the center has been
moved into the `top right` corner, so the closest corner is 0 pixels
away from the center. Now what?

In this case, the specification explicitly says that the gradient should
be rendered as if it's "a circle whose radius \[is\] an arbitrary very
small number greater than zero." So that might mean as if it had a
radius of one-one-billionth of a pixel, or a picometer, or heck, the
Planck length. The interesting thing is that it means the gradient is
still a circle. It's just a very, very, very small circle. Probably, it
will be too small to render anything visible. If so, you'll just get a
solid-color fill that corresponds to the color of the last color stop
instead.

Ellipses with zero-length dimensions have fascinatingly different
defined behaviors. Let's assume the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(0px 50% at center, purple, gold)
```

The []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061338224 primary="mirrored linear gradient"
data-type="indexterm"}specification states that any ellipse with a zero
width is rendered as if it's "an ellipse whose height \[is\] an
arbitrary very large number and whose width \[is\] an arbitrary very
small number greater than zero." In other words, render it as though
it's a linear gradient mirrored around the vertical axis running through
the center of the ellipse. The specification also says that in such a
case, any color stops with percentage positions resolve to `0px`. This
will usually result in a solid color matching the color defined for the
last color stop.

On the other hand, if you use lengths to position the color stops, you
can get a vertically mirrored horizontal linear gradient for free.
Consider the following gradient, illustrated in
[Figure 9-38](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig91){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(0px 50% at center, purple 0px, gold 100px)
```

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_785"><span class="label">Figure 9-38.
</span>The effects of a zero-width ellipse</h6>
</div>
</figure>

How did this happen? First, remember that the specification says that
the `0px` horizontal width is treated as if it's a tiny nonzero number.
For the sake of illustration, let's suppose that's one-one-thousandth of
a pixel (0.001 px). That means the ellipse shape is a thousandth of a
pixel wide by half the height of the image. Again for the sake of
illustration, let's suppose that's a height of 100 pixels. That means
the first ellipse shape is a thousandth of a pixel wide by 100 pixels
tall, which is an aspect ratio of 0.001:100, or 1:100,000.

OK, so every ellipse drawn along the gradient ray has a 1:100,000 aspect
ratio. That means the ellipse at half a pixel along the gradient ray is
1 pixel wide and 100,000 pixels tall. At 1 pixel, it's 2 pixels wide and
200,000 pixels tall. At 5 pixels, the ellipse is 10 pixels by a
[million]{.keep-together} pixels. At 50 pixels along the gradient ray,
the ellipse is 100 pixels wide and 10 million tall. And so on. This is
diagrammed in [Figure 9-39](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig92){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig92" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_0939.png" width="600" height="340"
alt="css5 0939" />
<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_786"><span class="label">Figure 9-39.
</span>Very, very tall ellipses</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So you can see why the visual effect is of a mirrored linear gradient.
These ellipses are effectively drawing vertical lines. Technically they
aren't, but in practical terms they are. The result is as if you have a
vertically mirrored horizontal gradient, because each ellipse is
centered on the center of the gradient, and both sides of it get drawn.
While this may be a radial gradient, we can't see its radial nature.

On the other hand, if the ellipse has width but not height, the results
are quite different. You'd think the result would be a vertical linear
gradient mirrored around the horizontal axis, but not so! Instead, the
result is a solid color equal to the last color stop (unless it's a
repeating gradient, a subject we'll turn to shortly, in which case it
should be a solid color equal to the average color of the gradient). So,
given either of the following, you'll get a solid gold:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
radial-gradient(50% 0px at center, purple, gold)
radial-gradient(50% 0px at center, purple 0px, gold 100px)
```

Why the difference? It goes back to the way radial gradients are
constructed from the gradient ray. Again, remember that, per the
specification, a zero distance here is treated as a very small nonzero
number. As before, we'll assume that `0px` is reassigned to `0.001px`,
and that the `50%` evaluates to 100 pixels. That's an aspect ratio of
100:0.001, or 100,000:1.

So, to get an ellipse that's 1 pixel tall, the width of that ellipse
must be 100,000 pixels. But our last color stop is at only 100 pixels!
At that point, the ellipse that's drawn is 100 pixels wide and a
thousandth of a pixel tall. All of the purple-to-gold transition that
happens along the gradient ray has to happen in that thousandth of a
pixel. Everything after that is gold, as per the final color stop. Thus,
we can see only the gold.

You might think that if you increased the position value of the last
color stop to `100000px`, you'd see a thin sliver of purplish color
running horizontally across the image. And you'd be right, *if* the
browser treats `0px` as `0.001px` in these cases. If it assumes
`0.00000001px` instead, you'd have to increase the color stop's position
a *lot* further in order to see anything. And that's assuming the
browser was actually calculating and drawing all those ellipses, instead
of just hardcoding the special cases. The latter is a lot more likely,
honestly. It's what we'd do if we were in charge of a browser's
gradient-rendering code.

And what if an ellipse has zero width *and* zero height? In that case,
the specification is written such that the zero-width behavior is used;
thus, you'll get the mirrored-linear-gradient behavior.

As of late 2022, browser support for the defined behavior in these edge
cases is unstable, at best. Some browsers use the last color-stop's
color in all cases, and others refuse to draw a gradient at all in some
cases.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061213904 primary=""

## Repeating Radial Gradients {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_788}

While []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061210288 primary="repeating elements"
secondary="gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061209280
primary="radial gradients" secondary="repeating"
data-type="indexterm"}percentages in repeating linear gradients could
turn them into nonrepeating gradients, percentages can be very useful if
the size of the circle or ellipse is defined, percentage positions along
the gradient ray are defined, and you can see beyond the endpoint of the
gradient ray. For example, assume the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.allhail {background:
    repeating-radial-gradient(100px 50px, purple, gold 20%, green 40%,
                              purple 60%, yellow 80%, purple);}
```

As there are five color stops and the size is 100px, a color stop will
occur every 20 pixels, with the colors repeating in the declared
pattern. Because the first and last color stops have the same color
value, there is no hard color switch. The ripples just spread out
forever, or at least until they're beyond the edges of the gradient
image. See [Figure 9-40](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig100){data-type="xref"} for
an example.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig100" class="figure">

Just imagine what that would look like with a repeating radial gradient
of a rainbow!

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.wdim {background:
    repeating-radial-gradient(
        100px circle at bottom center,
        rgb(83%,83%,83%) 50%,
        violet 55%, indigo 60%, blue 65%, green 70%,
        yellow 75%, orange 80%, red 85%,
        rgb(47%,60%,73%) 90%
    );}
```

Keep these two points in mind when creating repeating radial gradients:

-   If you don't declare size dimensions for a radial, it will default
    to an ellipse that has the same height-to-width ratio as the overall
    gradient image; *and*, if you don't declare a size for the image
    with `background-size`, the gradient image will default to the
    height and width of the element background where it's being applied
    (or, if being used as a list-style bullet, the size that the browser
    gives it).

-   The default radial size value is `farthest-corner`. This will put
    the endpoint of the gradient ray far enough to the right that its
    ellipse intersects with the corner of the gradient image that's
    farthest from the center point of the radial gradient.

These are reiterated here to remind you that if you stick to the
defaults, there's not really any point to having a repeating gradient,
since you'll be able to see only the first iteration of the repeat. It's
only when you restrict the initial size of the gradient that the repeats
become visible.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797061019792 primary=""

Radial []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_gradient_conic primary="gradients"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_conic_grad
primary="conic gradients" data-type="indexterm"}gradients are fun, but
what if you want a gradient that wraps around a central point, similar
to a color hue wheel? That's what CSS calls a *conic gradient*, which
can be thought of as a concentric series of linear gradients that are
bent into circles. Looked at another way, at any distance from the
center, there's a circle whose outer rim could be straightened out into
a linear gradient with the color stop specified.

Conic gradients are more easily shown than described, so consider the
following CSS, which is illustrated in
[Figure 9-41](#ch09.xhtml_conic-gradient-simple){data-type="xref"} along
with a linear diagram to show how the stops wrap around the conical
space:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background:
     conic-gradient(
          black, gray, black, white, black, silver, gray
     );

Note how each of the []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_color_stop_conic
primary="color stops" secondary="conic gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_ix_grad_color_stop3
primary="gradients" secondary="color stops" data-type="indexterm"}color
stops is labeled on the linear gradient: the circled numbers listed
there are repeated in the conic gradient, to show where each color stop
falls. At 60 degrees around the conic gradient, there is a `gray` color
stop. At 180 degrees, a `white` color stop. At the top of the conic
gradient, the `0deg` and `360deg` points meet, so `black` and `gray` sit
next to each other.

By default, conic gradients start at 0 degrees, using the same compass
degree system that transforms and other parts of CSS use, so `0deg` is
at the top. If you want to start from a different angle and wrap around
the circle back to that point, it's as straightforward as adding `from`
and an angle value to the front of the `conic-gradient` value, which
rotates the entire gradient by the declared angle. The following would
all have the same result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
conic-gradient(from 144deg, black, gray, black, white)
conic-gradient(from 2.513274rad, black, gray, black, white)
conic-gradient(from 0.4turn, black, gray, black, white)
```

If the conic gradient is given a different start angle, such as
`from 45deg`, it acts as a rotation of the entire conic gradient.
Consider the following two examples, with the results depicted in
[Figure 9-42](#ch09.xhtml_conic-gradients-different-start-angles){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
conic-gradient(black, white 90deg, gray 180deg, black 270deg, white)
conic-gradient(from 45deg, black, white 90deg, gray 180deg, black 270deg, white)
```

</span>Conic gradients with angled color stops and different start
angles</h6>
</div>

Not only is the starting point rotated 45 degrees, but all the other
color stops are as well. Thus, even though the first color stop has an
angle of `90deg`, it actually occurs at the 135-degree mark, that being
90 degrees with a 45-degree rotation added.

It's also possible to change the location of the gradient's center point
within the image, just as with radial gradients. The syntax is quite
similar, as you can see in this code block (illustrated in
[Figure 9-43](#ch09.xhtml_conic-gradients-rotated-and-offset){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
conic-gradient(from 144deg at 3em 6em, black, gray, black, white)
conic-gradient(from 144deg at 67% 25%, black, gray, black, white)
conic-gradient(from 144 deg at center bottom, black, gray, black, white)
```

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_793"><span class="label">Figure 9-43.
</span>Rotated and offset conic gradients</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first of the three examples, the center of the conic gradient is
placed `3em` to the right of the top-left corner, and `6em` down from
that same corner. Similarly, the second example shows the center point
`67%` of the way across the conic-gradient image, and `25%` down from
the top.

The third example shows what happens when the center point of a conic
gradient is placed along one edge of the image: we see only half (at
most) of the gradient. In this case, the top half is visible---that is,
the colors from 270 degrees through 90 degrees.

So all together, the syntax for a conic gradient is as follows:

    conic-gradient(
        [ from <angle>]? [ at <position>]? , | at <position>, ]?
          <color-stop> , [ <color-hint>]? , <color-stop> ]+
    )

If the `from` angle is not given, it defaults to `0deg`. If no `at`
position is given, it defaults to `50% 50%` (that is, the center of the
conic-gradient image).

Much as with radial and linear gradients, color stop distances can be
specified by a percentage value; in this case, it resolves to an angle
value. Thus, for a conic gradient starting at 0 degrees, the color stop
distance `25%` would resolve to 90 degrees, as 90 is 25% of 360. Conic
color stops can also be specified as a degree value, as shown
previously.

You *cannot* specify a length value for a conic gradient's color stop's
distance. Only percentages and angles are acceptable, and they can be
mixed.

# Creating Conic Color Stops {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_794}

If you want a conic gradient to blend smoothly from color to color all
the way around the circle, it is necessary to make the last color stop
match the first color stop. Otherwise, you'll see the kinds of hard
transitions shown in earlier examples. If you want to create a color hue
wheel, for example, you need to declare it like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
conic-gradient(red, magenta, blue, aqua, lime, yellow, red)
```

Except that's not actually a wheel, since the conic-gradient image fills
the entire background area, and background areas in CSS are (thus far)
rectangular by default. To make the color wheel actually look like a
color wheel, you'd need to either use a circular clipping path (see
[Chapter 20](../Text/ch20.xhtml#filters-compositing){data-type="xref"})
or round the corners on a square element (see
[Chapter 7](../Text/ch07.xhtml#padding-borders-outlines-and-margins){data-type="xref"}).
For example, the following will have the result shown in
[Figure 9-44](#ch09.xhtml_conic-gradients-hue-wheels){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.hues {
     height: 10em; width: 10em;
     background: conic-gradient(red, magenta, blue, aqua, lime, yellow, red);
}
#wheel {
     border-radius: 50%;
}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}

<div class="hues" id="wheel"></div>
```

This emphasizes that while it's easy to think of conic gradients as
circles, the end result is a rectangle, absent any clipping or other
effort to make the element's background area nonrectangular. So if
you're thinking about using conic gradients to make, say, a pie chart,
you'll have to do more than just define a conic gradient with hard
stops.

Just as we used two length-percentage values to create hard stops in
linear gradients, we can use two hard stops in conic gradients. For
example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
conic-gradient(
	green 37.5%,
	yellow 37.5% 62.5%,
	red 62.5%);
```

In this syntax, a given color stop can be written as \<*`color`*\>
\<*`beginning`*\> \<*`ending`*\>, where \<*`beginning`*\> and
\<*`ending`*\> are percentage or angle values.

If you want to create smoother transitions between colors but still have
them be mostly solid, the \<*`color`*\> \<*`beginning`*\> \<*`ending`*\>
syntax can help a lot. For example, the following conic gradient eases
the transitions between green, yellow, and red without making the
overall gradient too "smeared":

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
conic-gradient(green 35%, yellow 40% 60%, red 65%);
```

This runs a solid wedge of green from 0 to 126 degrees (35%), then
transitions smoothly from green to yellow between 126 degrees and 144
degrees (40%), past which there is a solid wedge of yellow spanning from
144 degrees to 216 degrees (60%). Similarly, a smoothed transition
occurs from yellow to red between 216 degrees and 234 degrees (65%), and
beyond that, a solid red wedge running to 360 degrees.

All this is illustrated in
[Figure 9-45](#ch09.xhtml_conic-gradients-smoothed-triple){data-type="xref"},
with extra annotations to mark where the calculated angles land.

And, as it happens, that syntax makes it relatively easy to re-create
those picnic tablecloths discussed earlier in the chapter by using a
conic gradient:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-image: conic-gradient(
	rgba(0 0 0 / 0.2) 0% 25%,
	rgba(0 0 0 / 0.4) 25% 50%,
	rgba(0 0 0 / 0.2) 50% 75%,
	transparent 75% 100%
	);
background-size: 2vw 2vw;
background-repeat: repeat;
```

This creates, in a single gradient image, a set of four squares in the
pattern. That image is then sized and repeated. It's not more efficient
or elegant than using repeating linear gradients, but it does embody a
certain cleverness that appeals to us.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797060388080

## Repeating Conic Gradients {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_797}

And now we come to []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_repeat_conic
primary="repeating elements" secondary="gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797060401072
primary="checkerboard pattern, conic gradient"
data-type="indexterm"}repeating conic gradients, which are highly useful
if you want to create a starburst pattern or even something simple like
a checkerboard pattern. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
conic-gradient(
    #0002 0 25%, #FFF2 0 50%, #0002 0 75%, #FFF2 0 100%
    )
```

This sets up a checkerboard pattern with four color stops but only two
colors. We can restate that using `repeating-conic-gradient` like so,
with new colors to make the [pattern]{.keep-together} a little clearer:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
repeating-conic-gradient(
     #343 0 25%, #ABC 0 50%
     )
```

All that was necessary in this simple repeating case was to set up the
first two color stops. After that, the stops are repeated until the full
360 degrees of the conic gradient are filled, as shown in
[Figure 9-46](#ch09.xhtml_repeating-conic-checkerboard){data-type="xref"}.

This []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797060290448
primary="starburst pattern, conic gradient" data-type="indexterm"}means
we can create wedges of any size, with any transition, and repeat them
all the way around the conic circle. Here are just three examples,
rendered in
[Figure 9-47](#ch09.xhtml_repeating-conic-starbursts){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
repeating-conic-gradient(#117 5deg, #ABE 15deg, #117 25deg)
repeating-conic-gradient(#117 0 5deg, #ABE 0 15deg, #117 0 25deg)

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_799"><span class="label">Figure 9-47.
</span>Three variants on a repeating conic gradient</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the first (leftmost) example's smoothed transitions hold
true even at the top of the image: the transition from `#117` at 350
degrees to `#ABE` at 5 degrees is handled like all of the other
transitions. Repeated conic gradients are unique in this way, since both
linear and radial gradients never "wrap around" to have the end meet the
beginning. This is also seen in the third (rightmost) example in
[Figure 9-47](#ch09.xhtml_repeating-conic-starbursts){data-type="xref"}.

It's possible to break this special behavior, though, as the second
(center) example illustrates: note the narrower wedge from 355 degrees
through 360 degrees. This happens because the first color stop in the
pattern explicitly runs from 0 degrees through 5 degrees. Thus, there is
no way to transition from 355 degrees through to 5 degrees, which leads
to a hard transition at 360/0 degrees.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797060198880

As we have []{#ch09.xhtml_ix_grad_repeat_sp primary="gradients"
secondary="repeating for special effect"
data-type="indexterm"}previously emphasized (possibly to excess),
gradients are images. That means you can size, position, repeat, and
otherwise affect them with the various background properties, just as
you would any PNG or SVG.

One way this can be leveraged is to repeat simple gradients. (Repeating
in more complex ways is the subject of the next section.) For example,
you could use a hard-stop radial gradient to give your background a
dotted look, as shown in
[Figure 9-48](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig93){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background: radial-gradient(circle at center,
                    rgba(0 0 0 / 0.1), rgba(0 0 0 / 0.1) 10px,
                    transparent 10px, transparent)
                    center / 25px 25px repeat,
                    tan;}
```

</div>

Yes, this is visually pretty much the same as tiling a PNG that has a
mostly transparent dark circle 10 pixels in diameter. Using a gradient
in this case has three advantages:

-   The CSS is almost certainly smaller in bytes than the PNG would be.

-   Even more importantly, the PNG requires an extra hit on the server.
    This slows both page and server performance. A CSS gradient is part
    of the stylesheet and so eliminates the extra server hit.

-   Changing the gradient is a lot simpler, so experimenting to find
    exactly the right size, shape, and darkness is much easier.

## Creating Special Effects {#ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_802}

Gradients can't do []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797060107376
primary="curtain effect, with gradients"
data-type="indexterm"}everything a raster or vector image can, so it's
not as though you'll be giving up external images completely now that
gradients are a thing. You can still pull off some pretty impressive
effects with gradients, though. Consider the background effect shown in
[Figure 9-49](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig94){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch09.xhtml_cab_fig94" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch09.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_803"><span class="label">Figure 9-49.
</span>It’s time to play the music…</h6>
</div>
</figure>

That curtain effect is accomplished with just two linear gradients
repeated at differing intervals, plus a third to create a "glow" effect
along the bottom of the background. Here's the code that accomplishes
it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
background-image:
    linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(255 128 128 / 0.25), transparent 75%),
    linear-gradient(89deg,
        transparent 30%,
        #510A0E 35% 40%, #61100F 43%, #B93F3A 50%,
        #4B0408 55%, #6A0F18 60%, #651015 65%,
        #510A0E 70% 75%, rgba(255 128 128 / 0) 80%, transparent),
    linear-gradient(92deg,
        #510A0E 20%, #61100F 25%, #B93F3A 40%, #4B0408 50%,
        #6A0F18 70%, #651015 80%, #510A0E 90%);
background-size: auto, 300px 100%, 109px 100%;
background-repeat: repeat-x;
```

The first (and therefore topmost) gradient is just a fade from a
75%-transparent light red up to full transparency at the 75% point of
the gradient line. Then two "fold" images are created.
[Figure 9-50](#ch09.xhtml_cab_fig95){data-type="xref"} shows each
separately.

With those images defined, they are repeated along the x-axis and given
different sizes. The first, which is the "glow" effect, is given `auto`
size to let it cover the entire element background. The second is given
a width of `300px` and a height of `100%`; thus, it will be as tall as
the element background and 300 pixels wide. This means it will be tiled
every 300 pixels along the x-axis. The same is true of the third image,
except it tiles every 109 pixels. The end result looks like an irregular
stage curtain.

The beauty of this is that adjusting the tiling intervals is just a
matter of editing the stylesheet. Changing the color-stop positions or
the colors is less trivial, but not too difficult if you know the effect
you're after. And adding a third set of repeating folds is no more
difficult than just adding another gradient to the
stack.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797059923648 primary=""

It's worth []{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797059921184 primary="gradients"
secondary="triggering average colors in" data-type="indexterm"}asking
what happens if a repeating gradient's first and last color stops
somehow end up being in the same place. For example, suppose your
fingers miss the 5 key and you accidentally declare the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
repeating-radial-gradient(center, purple 0px, gold 0px)
```

The first and last color stops are 0 pixels apart, but the gradient is
supposed to repeat ad infinitum along the gradient line. Now what?

In such a case, the browser finds the *average gradient color* and fills
it in throughout the entire gradient image. In our simple case in the
preceding code, that will be a 50/50 blend of purple and `gold` (which
will be about `#C06C40` or `rgb(75%,42%,25%)`). Thus, the resulting
gradient image should be a solid orangey-brown, which doesn't really
look much like a gradient.

This condition can also be triggered when the browser rounds the
color-stop positions to 0, or when the distance between the first and
last color stops is so small as compared to the output resolution that
nothing useful can be rendered. This could happen if, for example, a
repeating radial gradient used all percentages for the color-stop
positions and was sized using `closest-side`, but was accidentally
placed into a corner.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797059898928 primary=""

As of late 2022, no browsers really do average colors correctly. Some of
the correct behaviors can be triggered under very limited conditions,
but in most cases, browsers either just use the last color stop as a
fill color, or else try really hard to draw subpixel repeating
patterns.[]{#ch09.xhtml_idm45797059896736 primary=""

# [Chapter 10. ]{.label}Floating and Positioning

For a very long time, floated elements were the basis of all our web
layout schemes. (This is largely because of the property `clear`, which
we'll get to in a bit.) But floats were never meant for layout; their
use as a layout tool was a hack nearly as egregious as the use of tables
for layout. They were just what we had. Floats
[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_ch10 primary="floating"
data-type="indexterm"}are quite interesting and useful in their own
right, however. This is especially true given the recent addition of
float *shaping*, which allows the creation of nonrectangular shapes that
content can flow past.

:::::::::::::::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Floating" data-type="sect1"}

# Floating {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_808}

Ever since the early 1990s, it has been possible to float images by
declaring, for instance, `<img src="b5.gif" alt="B4" align="right">`.
[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059887248 primary="align attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}This causes an image to float to the right and
allows other content (such as text) to "flow around" the image. The name
*floating*, in fact, came from the Netscape DevEdge page "Extensions to
HTML 2.0," which explained the then-new `align` attribute. Unlike HTML,
CSS lets you []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_prop primary="float property"
data-type="indexterm"}float any element, from images to paragraphs to
lists. This is accomplished using the property `float`.

For example, to float an image to the left, you could use this markup:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<img src="b4.gif" style="float: left;" alt="b4">
```

As [Figure 10-1](#ch10.xhtml_floating_image_fig){data-type="xref"}
illustrates, the image "floats" to the left side of the browser window,
and the text flows around it.

You can float to the `left` or `right`, as well as to the `inline-start`
and `inline-end` edges of an element. These latter two are useful when
you want to float an element toward the start or end of the inline axis,
regardless of the direction that axis is pointing. (See
[Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"}

## Floated Elements {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_812}

Keep a few points in mind with regard to
[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_elem_rule primary="floating"
secondary="floated element rules" data-type="indexterm"}floating
elements. First, a floated element is, in some ways, removed from the
normal flow of the document, although it still affects the layout of the
normal flow. In a manner utterly unique within CSS, floated elements
exist almost on their own plane, yet they still have influence over the
rest of the document.

This influence arises because when an element is floated, other
normal-flow content "flows around" it. This is familiar behavior with
floated images, but the same is true if you float a paragraph, for
example. In
[Figure 10-2](#ch10.xhtml_floating_paragraph_fig){data-type="xref"}, you
can see this effect quite clearly, thanks to the margin added to the
floated paragraph:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.aside {float: inline-end; width: 15em; margin: 0 1em 1em;
     padding: 0.25em; border: 1px solid;}

secondary="margins and"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059753264 primary="margins"
secondary="floating images" data-type="indexterm"}facts to notice about
floated elements is that margins around floated elements do not
collapse. If you float an image and give it 25-pixel margins, there will
be at least 25 pixels of space around that image. If other elements
adjacent to the image---and that means adjacent horizontally *and*
vertically---also have margins, those margins will not collapse with the
margins on the floated image. The following code results in
[Figure 10-3](#ch10.xhtml_floating_images_with_margins_fig){data-type="xref"},
with 50 pixels of space between the two floated images:

### No floating at all {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_815}

CSS has one other value for `float` []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059719824
primary="floating" secondary="preventing" data-type="indexterm"}besides
the ones we've discussed: `float: none` is used to prevent an element
from floating at all.

This might seem a little silly, since the easiest way to keep an element
from floating is to avoid declaring a `float`, right? Well, first of
all, the default value of `float` is `none`. In other words, the value
has to exist in order for normal, nonfloating behavior to be possible;
without it, all elements would float in one way or another.

Second, you might want to override floating in some cases. Imagine that
you're using a server-wide stylesheet that floats images. On one
particular page, you don't want those images to float. Rather than
writing a whole new stylesheet, you could place `img {float: none;}` in
your document's embedded stylesheet.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059715536

to establish the concept of a *containing block*. A floated element's
containing block is the nearest block-level ancestor element. Therefore,
in the following markup, the floated element's containing block is the
paragraph element that contains it:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>
    Test
</h1>
<p>
    This is paragraph text, but you knew that. Within the content of this
    paragraph is an image that's been floated. <img src="testy.gif" alt=""
    class="floated-figure"> The containing block for the floated image is
    the paragraph.
</p>
```

We'll return to the concept of containing blocks when we discuss
positioning in
["Positioning"](#ch10.xhtml_positioning){data-type="xref"}.

Furthermore, a floated element generates a block box, regardless of the
kind of element it is. Thus, if you float a link, even though the
element is inline and would ordinarily generate an inline box, it
generates a block box. It will be laid out and act as if it was, for
example, a `<div>`. This is not unlike declaring `display: block` for
the floated element, although it is not necessary to do so.

A series of specific rules govern the placement of a floated element, so
let's cover those before digging into applied behavior. These rules are
vaguely similar to those that govern the evaluation of margins and
widths and have the same initial appearance of common sense. They are as
follows:

1.  The left (or right) outer edge of a floated element may not be to
    the left (or right) of the inner edge of its containing block.

    This is straightforward enough. The outer-left edge of a
    left-floated element can go only as far left as the inner-left edge
    of its containing block. Similarly, the farthest right a
    right-floated element may go is its containing block's inner-right
    edge, as shown in
    [Figure 10-4](#ch10.xhtml_floating_to_the_left_fig){data-type="xref"}.
    (In this and subsequent figures, the circled numbers show the
    position where the markup element actually appears in relation to
    the source, and the numbered boxes show the position and size of the
    floated visible element.)

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_floating_to_the_left_fig" class="figure">

    </span>Floating to the left (or right)</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

2.  To prevent []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_overlap_elem_float
    primary="overlapping elements" secondary="floated"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_overlap
    primary="floating" secondary="overlapping content prevention"
    data-type="indexterm"}overlap with other floated elements, the left
    outer edge of a floated element must be to the right of the right
    outer edge of a left-floating element that occurs earlier in the
    document source, unless the top of the latter element is below the
    bottom of the earlier element. Similarly, the right outer edge of a
    floated element must be to the left of the left outer edge of a
    right-floating element that comes earlier in the document source,
    unless the top of the latter element is below the bottom of the
    [earlier]{.keep-together} element.

    This rule prevents floated elements from "overwriting" each other.
    If an element is floated to the left, and another floated element is
    already there, the latter element will be placed against the
    outer-right edge of the previously floated element. If, however, a
    floated element's top is below the bottom of all earlier floated
    images, it can float all the way to the inner-left edge of the
    parent.
    [Figure 10-5](#ch10.xhtml_keeping_floats_from_overlapping_fig){data-type="xref"}
    shows some examples.

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_keeping_floats_from_overlapping_fig" class="figure">
    <img src="./images/css5_1005.png" width="430" height="400"
    alt="css5 1005" />
    <h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_818"><span class="label">Figure 10-5.
    </span>Keeping floats from overlapping</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

    The advantage of this rule is that all your floated content will be
    visible, since you don't have to worry about one floated element
    obscuring another. This makes floating a fairly safe thing to do.
    The situation is markedly different when using positioning, where it
    is very easy to cause elements to overwrite one another.

3.  The right outer edge of a left-floating element may not be to the
    right of the left outer edge of any right-floating element to its
    right. The left outer edge of a right-floating element may not be to
    the left of the right outer edge of any left-floating element to its
    left.

    This rule prevents floated elements from overlapping each other.
    Let's say you have a body that is 500 pixels wide, and its sole
    content is two images that are 300 pixels wide. The first is floated
    to the left, and the second is floated to the right. This rule
    prevents the second image from overlapping the first by 100 pixels.
    Instead, it is forced down until its top is below the bottom of the
    right-floating image, as depicted in
    [Figure 10-6](#ch10.xhtml_more_overlap_prevention_fig){data-type="xref"}.

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_more_overlap_prevention_fig" class="figure">

    </span>More overlap prevention</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

4.  A floating element's top may not be higher than the inner top of its
    parent. If a floating element is between two collapsing margins, the
    floated element is placed as though it had a block-level parent
    element between the two elements.

    The first part of this rule keeps floating elements from floating
    all the way to the top of the document.
    [Figure 10-7](#ch10.xhtml_unlike_balloons_fig){data-type="xref"}
    illustrates the correct behavior. The second part of this rule
    fine-tunes the alignment in some situations---for example, when the
    middle of three paragraphs is floated. In that case, the floated
    paragraph is floated as if it had a block-level parent element (say,
    a `<div>`). This prevents the floated paragraph from moving up to
    the top of whatever common parent the three paragraphs share.

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_unlike_balloons_fig" class="figure">
    <img src="./images/css5_1007.png" width="471" height="297"
    alt="css5 1007" />
    <h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_820"><span class="label">Figure 10-7.
    </span>Unlike balloons, floated elements can’t float upward</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

5.  A floating element's top may not be higher than the top of any
    earlier floating or block-level
    element.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059569264 primary=""
    startref="ix_float_overlap"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059568288 primary=""
    startref="ix_overlap_elem_float" data-type="indexterm"}

    Similarly to rule 4, rule 5 keeps floated elements from floating all
    the way to the top of their parent elements. It is also impossible
    for a floated element's top to be any higher than the top of a
    floated element that occurs earlier.
    [Figure 10-8](#ch10.xhtml_keeping_floats_below_fig){data-type="xref"}
    shows an example: since the second float was forced to be below the
    first one, the third float's top is even with the top of the second
    float, not the first.

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_keeping_floats_below_fig" class="figure">

    </span>Keeping floats below their predecessors</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

6.  A floating element's top may not be higher than the top of any line
    box that contains a box generated by an element that comes earlier
    in the document source.

    Similarly to rules 4 and 5, this rule further limits the upward
    floating of an element by preventing it from being above the top of
    a line box containing content that precedes the floated element.
    Let's say that, right in the middle of a paragraph, there is a
    floated image. The highest the top of that image may be placed is
    the top of the line box from which the image originates. As you can
    see in
    [Figure 10-9](#ch10.xhtml_keeping_floats_level_fig){data-type="xref"},
    this keeps images from floating too far upward.

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_keeping_floats_level_fig" class="figure">
    <img src="./images/css5_1009.png" width="430" height="400"
    alt="css5 1009" />
    <h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_822"><span class="label">Figure 10-9.
    </span>Keeping floats level with their context</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

7.  A left-floating element that has another floating element to its
    left may not have its right outer edge to the right of its
    containing block's right edge. Similarly, a right-floating element
    that has another floating element to its right may not have its
    right outer edge to the left of its containing block's left edge.

    In other words, a floating element cannot stick out beyond the edge
    of its containing element, unless it's too wide to fit on its own.
    This prevents a succeeding number of floated elements from appearing
    in a horizontal line and far exceeding the edges of the containing
    block. Instead, a float that would otherwise stick out of its
    containing block by appearing next to another one will be floated
    down to a point below any previous floats, as illustrated by
    [Figure 10-10](#ch10.xhtml_if_theres_no_room_fig){data-type="xref"}
    (in the figure, the floats start on the next line in order to more
    clearly illustrate the principle at work here).

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_if_theres_no_room_fig" class="figure">

    </span>If there isn’t room, floats get pushed to a new “line”</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

8.  A floating element must be placed as high as possible.

    Rule 8 is, as you might expect, subject to the restrictions
    introduced by the previous seven rules. Historically, browsers
    aligned the top of a floated element with the top of the line box
    after the one in which the image's tag appears. Rule 8, however,
    implies that its top should be even with the top of the same line
    box as that in which its tag appears, assuming there is enough room.
    [Figure 10-11](#ch10.xhtml_given_the_other_constraints_fig){data-type="xref"}
    shows the theoretically correct behaviors.

    <figure class="bordernone">
    <div id="ch10.xhtml_given_the_other_constraints_fig" class="figure">
    <img src="./images/css5_1011.png" width="474" height="400"
    alt="css5 1011" />
    <h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_824"><span class="label">Figure 10-11.
    </span>Given the other constraints, go as high as possible</h6>
    </div>
    </figure>

9.  A left-floating element must be put as far to the left as possible,
    and a right-floating element as far to the right as
    possible.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059549776 primary=""
    startref="ix_float_elem_rule" data-type="indexterm"} A higher
    position is preferred to one that is farther to the right or left.

    Again, this rule is subject to restrictions introduced in the
    preceding rules. As you can see in
    [Figure 10-12](#ch10.xhtml_get_as_far_to_the_left_fig){data-type="xref"},
    it is pretty easy to tell when an element has gone as far as
    possible to the right or left.

## Applied Behavior {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_826}

Several interesting consequences fall out of the rules we've just seen,
both because of what they say and what they don't say. The first topic
to discuss is what happens when the floated element is taller than its
parent element.

This []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_backg primary="floating"
secondary="backgrounds and" data-type="indexterm"}happens quite often,
as a matter of fact. Take the example of a short document, composed of
no more than a few paragraphs and `<h3>` elements, where the first
paragraph contains a floated image. Further, this floated image has a
margin of 5 pixels (`5px`). You would expect the document to be rendered
as shown in
[Figure 10-13](#ch10.xhtml_expected_floating_fig){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch10.xhtml_expected_floating_fig" class="figure">

alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_827"><span class="label">Figure 10-13.
</span>Expected floating behavior</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Nothing there is unusual, but
[Figure 10-14](#ch10.xhtml_backgrounds_and_floated_elements){data-type="xref"}
shows what happens when you set the first paragraph to have a
background.

Nothing is different about the second example, except for the visible
background. As you can see, the floated image sticks out of the bottom
of its parent element. It also did so in the first example, but it was
less obvious there because you couldn't see the background. The floating
rules we discussed earlier address only the left, right, and top edges
of floats and their parents. The deliberate omission of bottom edges
requires the behavior in
[Figure 10-14](#ch10.xhtml_backgrounds_and_floated_elements){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch10.xhtml_backgrounds_and_floated_elements" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_828"><span class="label">Figure 10-14.
</span>Backgrounds and floated elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

CSS clarified this: one important aspect of floated-element behavior is
that a floated element will expand to contain any floated descendants.
Thus, you could contain a float within its parent element by floating
the parent, as in this example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="float: left; width: 100%;">
    <img src="hay.gif" style="float: left;" alt=""> The 'div' will stretch
    around the floated image because the 'div' has been floated.
</div>
```

On a related note, consider backgrounds and their relationship to
floated elements that occur earlier in the document, which is
illustrated in
[Figure 10-15](#ch10.xhtml_element_backgrounds_fig_){data-type="xref"}.

Because the []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059472544 primary="floating"
secondary="width of" data-type="indexterm"}floated element is both
within and outside of the flow, this sort of thing is bound to happen.
What's going on? The content of the heading is being "displaced" by the
floated element. However, the heading's element width is still as wide
as its parent element. Therefore, its content area spans the width of
the parent, and so does the background. The actual content doesn't flow
all the way across its own content area so that it can avoid being
obscured behind the floating element.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059471504
primary="" startref="ix_float_backg" data-type="indexterm"}

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Negative margins" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch10.xhtml_negative_margins .sect3}
### Negative margins {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_830}

Interestingly, []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_margin_neg4 primary="margins"
secondary="negative" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_neg_margin4
primary="negative margins"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_margin_float primary="margins"
secondary="floating images" data-type="indexterm"}negative margins can
cause floated elements to move outside of their parent elements. This
seems to be in direct contradiction to the rules explained earlier, but
it isn't. In the same way that elements can appear to be wider than
their parents through negative margins, floated elements can appear to
protrude out of their parents.

Let's consider an image that is floated to the left, and that has left
and top margins of `-15px`. This image is placed inside a `<div>` that
has no padding, borders, or margins.
[Figure 10-16](#ch10.xhtml_floating_with_negative_fig){data-type="xref"}
shows the result.

<figure>
<div id="ch10.xhtml_floating_with_negative_fig" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_831"><span class="label">Figure 10-16.
</span>Floating with negative margins</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Contrary to appearances, this does not violate the restrictions on
floated elements being placed outside their parent elements.

Here's the technicality that permits this behavior: a close reading of
the rules in the previous section will show that the outer edges of a
floating element must be within the element's parent. However, negative
margins can place the floated element's content such that it effectively
overlaps its own outer edge, as detailed in
[Figure 10-17](#ch10.xhtml_the_details_of_floating_fig){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch10.xhtml_the_details_of_floating_fig" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_832"><span class="label">Figure 10-17.
</span>The details of floating up and left with negative margins</h6>
</div>
</figure>

One important question arises: what happens to the document display when
an element is floated out of its parent element by using negative
margins? For example, an image could be floated so far up that it
intrudes into a paragraph that has already been displayed by the user
agent. In such a case, it's up to the user agent to decide whether the
document should be reflowed.

The CSS specification explicitly states that user agents are not
required to reflow previous content to accommodate things that happen
later in the document. In other words, if an image is floated up into a
previous paragraph, it will probably overwrite whatever was already
there. This makes the utility of negative margins on floats somewhat
limited. Hanging floats are usually fairly safe, but trying to push an
element upward on the page is generally a bad
idea.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059444576 primary=""
startref="ix_neg_margin4"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059443600 primary=""
startref="ix_margin_float"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059442656 primary=""
startref="ix_margin_neg4" data-type="indexterm"}

Another way for a floated element to exceed its parent's inner left and
right edges occurs when the floated element is wider than its parent. In
that case, the floated element will overflow the right or left inner
edge---depending on which way the element is floated---in its best
attempt to display itself correctly. This will lead to a result like
that shown in
[Figure 10-18](#ch10.xhtml_floating_an_element_thats_wider_fig){data-type="xref"}.

## Floats, Content, and Overlapping {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_834}

An []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_overlap2 primary="floating"
secondary="overlapping content prevention"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_overlap_float2
primary="overlapping elements" secondary="floated"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_inline primary="floating"
secondary="inline elements" data-type="indexterm"}interesting question
is this: what happens when a float overlaps content in the normal flow?
This can happen if, for example, a float has a negative margin on the
side where content is flowing past (e.g., a negative left margin on a
right-floating element). You've already seen what happens to the borders
and backgrounds of block-level elements. What about inline elements?

The []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059432240 primary="CSS2 specification"
secondary="inline boxes overlapping with floats"
data-type="indexterm"}CSS 2.1 specification states the following:

-   An inline box that overlaps with a float has its borders,
    background, and content all rendered "on top" of the float.

-   A block box that overlaps with a float has its borders and
    background rendered "behind" the float, whereas its content is
    rendered "on top" of the float.

To illustrate these rules, consider the following situation:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<img src="testy.gif" alt="" class="sideline">
<p class="box">
    This paragraph, unremarkable in most ways, does contain an inline element.
    This inline contains some <strong>strongly emphasized text, which is so
    marked to make an important point</strong>. The rest of the element's
    content is normal anonymous inline content.
</p>
<p>
    This is a second paragraph.  There's nothing remarkable about it, really.
    Please move along to the next bit.
</p>
<h2 id="jump-up">
    A Heading!
</h2>
```

To that markup, apply the following styles, with the result seen in
[Figure 10-19](#ch10.xhtml_layout_behavior_when_overlapping_fig){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

The inline element (`strong`) completely overlaps the floated

other hand, have only their content appear on top of the float. Their
backgrounds and borders are placed behind the float.

The described overlapping behavior is independent of the document source
order. It does not matter if an element comes before or after a float:
the same behaviors still apply.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059153104

We've []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_float_clear primary="floating"
secondary="clearing to control" data-type="indexterm"}talked quite a bit
about floating behavior, so we have only one more subject to discuss
before we turn to shapes. You won't always want your content to flow
past a floated element---in some cases, you'll specifically want to
prevent it. If your document is grouped into sections, you might not
want the floated elements from one section hanging down into the next.

In that case, you'd want to set the first element of each section to
prohibit floating elements from appearing next to it. If the first
element might otherwise be placed next to a floated element, it will be
pushed down until it appears below the floated image, and all subsequent
content will appear after that, as shown in
[Figure 10-20](#ch10.xhtml_displaying_an_element_fig){data-type="xref"}.

For example, to make sure all `<h3>` elements are not placed to the
right of left-floating elements, you would declare `h3 {clear: left;}`.
This can be translated as "make sure that the left side of an `<h3>` is
clear of floating elements and pseudo-elements." The following rule uses
`clear` to prevent `<h3>` elements from flowing past floated elements to
the left side:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h3 {clear: left;}
```

While this will push the `<h3>` past any left-floating elements, it will
allow floated elements to appear on the right side of `<h3>` elements,
as shown in
[Figure 10-21](#ch10.xhtml_clear_to_the_left_fig){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch10.xhtml_clear_to_the_left_fig" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_839"><span class="label">Figure 10-21.
</span>Clear to the left, but not the right</h6>
</div>
</figure>

To avoid this sort of thing, and to make sure that `<h3>` elements do
not coexist on a line with any floated elements, you use the value
`both`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h3 {clear: both;}
```

Understandably, this value prevents coexistence with floated elements on
both sides of the cleared element, as demonstrated in
[Figure 10-22](#ch10.xhtml_clear_on_both_sides_fig){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch10.xhtml_clear_on_both_sides_fig" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_840"><span class="label">Figure 10-22.
</span>Clear on both sides</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If, on the other hand, we were worried only about `<h3>` elements being
pushed down past floated elements to their right, then we'd use
`h3 {clear: right;}`.

As with `float`, you can give `clear` the values `inline-start` (and
`both`) or `inline-end`. If you're floating with those values, clearing
with them makes sense. If you're floating using `left` and `right`,
using those values for `clear` is sensible.

Finally, `clear: none` allows elements to float to either side of an
element. As with `float: none`, this value mostly exists to allow for
normal document behavior, in which elements will permit floated elements
to both sides. The `none` value can be used to override other styles, as
shown in
[Figure 10-23](#ch10.xhtml_not_clear_at_all_fig){data-type="xref"}.
Despite the document-wide rule that `<h3>` elements will not permit
floated elements to either side, one `<h3>` in particular has been set
so that it does permit floated elements on either side:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h3 {clear: both;}

<h3 style="clear: none;">What's With All The NEO?</h3>
```

The `clear` property []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797059024512
primary="clearance, floating elements" data-type="indexterm"}works by
way of *clearance*---extra spacing added above an element's top margin
in order to push it past any floated elements. This means that the top
margin of a cleared element does not change when an element is cleared.
Its downward movement is caused by the clearance instead. Pay close
attention to the placement of the heading's border in
[Figure 10-24](#ch10.xhtml_clearing_and_its_effect_fig){data-type="xref"},
which results from the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

There is no []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058943776 primary="floating"
secondary="margins and"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058942768 primary="margins"
secondary="floating images" data-type="indexterm"}separation between the
top border of the `<h3>` and the bottom border of the floated image
because 25 pixels of clearance was added above the 15-pixel top margin
in order to push the `<h3>`'s top border edge just past the bottom edge
of the float. This occurs unless the `<h3>`'s top margin calculates to
40 pixels or more, in which case the `<h3>` will naturally place itself
below the float, and the `clear` value will be irrelevant.

In most cases, you can't know how far an element needs to be cleared.
The way to make sure a cleared element has some space between its top
and the bottom of a float is to put a bottom margin on the float itself.
Therefore, if you want at least 15 pixels of space below the float in
the previous example, you would change the CSS like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.sider {float: left; margin: 0 0 15px;}
h3 {border: 1px solid gray; clear: left;}
```

The floated element's bottom margin increases the size of the float box,
and thus the point past which cleared elements must be pushed. This is
because, as you've seen before, the margin edges of a floated element
define the edges of the floated box.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058833760

# Positioning {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_843}

The idea []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_position_ch10 primary="positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}behind positioning is fairly simple. It allows you
to define exactly where element boxes will appear relative to where they
would ordinarily be---or position them in relation to a parent element,
another element, or even to the viewport (e.g., the browser window)
itself.

Before we delve into the various kinds of positioning, it's a good idea
to look at what types exist and how they differ.

The values of `position` have the following meanings:

`static`

:   The element's []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058802880 primary="offsets"
    secondary="static positioning"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058801872

    data-type="indexterm"}box is generated as normal. Block-level
    elements generate a rectangular box that is part of the document's
    flow, and inline-level boxes cause the creation of one or more line
    boxes that are flowed within their parent element.

`relative`

:   The element's []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058797776 primary="offsets"
    secondary="relative positioning"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058796768

    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058796096
    primary="positioning" secondary="relative" data-type="indexterm"}box
    is offset by a certain distance; `0px` by default. The element
    retains the shape it would have had were it not positioned, and the
    space that the element would ordinarily have occupied is preserved.

`absolute`

:   The element's box is []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058793200
    primary="absolute positioning"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058792496
    primary="offsets" secondary="absolute positioning"
    data-type="indexterm"}completely removed from the flow of the
    document and positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor,
    if any, or its containing block, which may be another element in the
    document or the initial containing block (described in the next
    section). Whatever space the element might have occupied in the
    normal document flow is closed up, as though the element did not
    exist. The positioned element generates a block-level box,
    regardless of the type of box it would have generated if it were in
    the normal flow.

`fixed`

:   The element's []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058790016
    primary="fixed positioning"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058789280

    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058788336
    primary="positioning" secondary="fixed" data-type="indexterm"}box
    behaves as though it was set to `absolute`, but its containing block
    is the viewport itself.

`sticky`

:   The []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058785440 primary="sticky positioning"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058784704

    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058783760
    primary="positioning" secondary="sticky"
    data-type="indexterm"}element is left in the normal flow, until the
    conditions that trigger its stickiness come to pass, at which point
    it is removed from the normal flow but its original space in the
    normal flow is preserved. It will then act as if absolutely
    positioned with respect to its containing block. Once the conditions
    to enforce stickiness are no longer met, the element is returned to
    the normal flow in its original space.

Don't worry so much about the details right now, as we'll look at each
of these kinds of positioning later. Before we do that, we need to
discuss containing blocks.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058782304 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058776064
primary="positioning" secondary="containing blocks and"
data-type="indexterm"}general terms, a *containing block* is the box
that contains another element, as we said earlier in the chapter. As an
example, in the normal-flow case, the root element (`<html>` in HTML) is
the containing block for the `<body>` element, which is in turn the
containing block for all its children, and so on. When it comes to
positioning, the containing block depends entirely on the type of
positioning.

For a nonroot element whose `position` value is `relative` or `static`,
its containing block is formed by the content edge of the nearest
block-level, table-cell, or inline-block ancestor box.

For a nonroot element that has a `position` value of `absolute`, its
containing block is set to the nearest ancestor (of any kind) that has a
`position` value other than `static`. This happens as follows:

-   If the ancestor is block-level, the containing block is set to be
    that element's padding edge; in other words, the area that would be
    bounded by a border.

-   If the ancestor is []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058768080
    primary="inline formatting" secondary="containing block and"
    data-type="indexterm"}inline-level, the containing block is set to
    the content edge of the ancestor. In left-to-right languages, the
    top and left of the containing block are the top and left content
    edges of the first box in the ancestor, and the bottom and right
    edges are the bottom and right content edges of the last box. In
    right-to-left languages, the right edge of the containing block
    corresponds to the right content edge of the first box, and the left
    is taken from the last box. The top and bottom are the same.

-   If []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058766112
    primary="initial containing block" data-type="indexterm"}there are
    no ancestors, the element's containing block is defined to be the
    initial containing block.

There's an []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058764528 primary="positioning"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058762880
primary="sticky positioning" data-type="indexterm"}interesting variant
to the containing-block rules when it comes to sticky-positioned
elements, which is that a rectangle is defined in relation to the
containing block called the *sticky-constraint rectangle*. This
rectangle has everything to do with how sticky positioning works, and
will be explained in full in ["Sticky
Positioning"](#ch10.xhtml_sticky-positioning){data-type="xref"}.

An important point: elements can be positioned outside of their
containing block. This suggests that the term "containing block" should
really be "positioning context," but since the specification uses
"containing block," so will we.

These properties describe an offset from the nearest side of the
containing block (thus the term *offset properties*). The simplest way
to look at it is that positive values cause inward offsets, moving the
edges toward the center of the containing block, and negative values
cause outward offsets.

For example, `top` describes how far the top margin edge of the
positioned element should be placed from the top of its containing
block. In the case of `top`, positive values move the top margin edge of
the positioned element *downward*, while negative values move it *above*
the top of its containing block. Similarly, `left` describes how far to
the right (for positive values) or left (for negative values) the left
margin edge of the positioned element is from the left edge of the
containing block. Positive values will shift the margin edge of the
positioned element to the right, and negative values will move it to the
left.

The implication of offsetting the margin edges is that it's possible to
set margins, borders, and padding for a positioned element; these will
be preserved and kept with the [positioned]{.keep-together} element, and
they will be contained within the area defined by the offset
[properties.]{.keep-together}

It is important to remember that the offset properties define an offset
from the analogous side (e.g., `inset-block-end` defines the offset from
the block-end side) of the containing block, not from the upper-left
corner of the containing block. This is why, for example, one way to
fill up the lower-right corner of a containing block is to use these
values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
top: 50%; bottom: 0; left: 50%; right: 0;
```

In this example, the outer-left edge of the positioned element is placed
halfway across the containing block. This is its offset from the left
edge of the containing block. The outer-right edge of the positioned
element, on the other hand, is not offset from the right edge of the
containing block, so the two are coincident. Similar reasoning holds
true for the top and bottom of the positioned element: the outer-top
edge is placed halfway down the containing block, but the outer-bottom
edge is not moved up from the bottom. This leads to what's shown in
[Figure 10-25](#ch10.xhtml_filling_lower-right-quarter){data-type="xref"}.

[Figure 10-25](#ch10.xhtml_filling_lower-right-quarter){data-type="xref"},
it has no margins, but if it did, they would create blank space between
the borders and the offset edges. This would make the positioned element
appear as though it did not completely fill the lower-right quarter of
the containing block. In truth, it *would* fill the area, because
margins count as part of the area of a positioned element, but this fact
wouldn't be immediately apparent to the eye.

Thus, the following two sets of styles would have approximately the same
visual appearance, assuming that the containing block is `100em` high by
`100em` wide:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#ex1 {top: 50%; bottom: 0; left: 50%; right: 0; margin: 10em;}
#ex2 {top: 60%; bottom: 10%; left: 60%; right: 10%; margin: 0;}
```

By using negative offset values, we can position an element outside its
[containing]{.keep-together} block. For example, the following values
will lead to the result shown in
[Figure 10-26](#ch10.xhtml_positioning_outside_block){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
top: 50%; bottom: -2em; left: 75%; right: -7em;
```

In addition to length and percentage values, the offset properties can
be set to `auto`, which is the default value. There is no single
behavior for `auto`; it changes based on the type of positioning used.
We'll explore how `auto` works later, as we consider each of the

For both properties, you can supply one or two values. If you supply
one, the same value is used for both sides; that is, `inset-block: 10px`
will use 10 pixels of inset for both the block-start and block-end
edges.

If you supply two values, the first is used for the start edge, and the
second for the end edge. Thus, `inset-inline: 1em 2em` will use 1 em of
inset for the inline start edge, and 2 ems of inset for the inline end
edge.

It's usually a lot easier to use these two shorthands for logical
insets, since you can always supply `auto` when you don't want to set a
specific offset---for example, `inset-block: 25% auto`.

Yes, it looks like this should be shorthand for the logical properties,
but it isn't. The following two rules have the same result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#popup {top: 25%; right: 4em; bottom: 25%; left: 2em;}
#popup {inset: 25% 4em 25% 2em;}

As with other physical shorthands such as those seen in
[Chapter 7](../Text/ch07.xhtml#padding-borders-outlines-and-margins){data-type="xref"},
the values are in the order TRBL (top, right, bottom, left), and an
omitted value is copied from the opposite side. Thus, `inset: 20px 2em`
is the same as writing
`inset: 20px 2em 20px 2em`.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058432000 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_height_prop2
primary="height property" secondary="positioning elements"
data-type="indexterm"}determining where you're going to position an
element, you will often want to declare how wide and how high that
element should be. In addition, you'll likely want to limit how high or
wide a positioned element gets.

If you want to give your positioned element a specific width, the
property to turn to is `width`. Similarly, `height` will let you declare
a specific height for a positioned element.

Although it is sometimes important to set the `width` and `height` of a
positioned element, it is not always necessary. For example, if the
placement of the four sides of the element is described using `top`,
`right`, `bottom`, and `left` (or with `inset-block-start`,
`inset-inline-start`, etc.), then the `height` and `width` of the
element are implicitly determined by the offsets. Assume that we want an
absolutely positioned element to fill the left half of its containing
block, from top to bottom. We could use these values, with the result
depicted in
[Figure 10-27](#ch10.xhtml_positioning_offset_only){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
inset: 0 50% 0 0;
```

</span>Positioning and sizing an element by using only the offset
properties</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Since the default value of both `width` and `height` is `auto`, the
result shown in
[Figure 10-27](#ch10.xhtml_positioning_offset_only){data-type="xref"} is
exactly the same as if we had used these values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
inset: 0 50% 0 0; width: 50%; height: 100%;
```

The presence of `width` and `height` in this specific example adds
nothing to the layout of the element.

If we were to add padding, a border, or a margin to the element, the
presence of explicit values for `height` and `width` could very well
make a difference:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
inset: 0 50% 0 0; width: 50%; height: 100%; padding: 2em;
```

This will give us a positioned element that extends out of its
containing block, as shown in
[Figure 10-28](#ch10.xhtml_positioning_partially_outside_block){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch10.xhtml_positioning_partially_outside_block" class="figure">

</span>Positioning an element partially outside its containing

</div>
</figure>

This happens because (by default) the padding is added to the content
area, and the content area's size is determined by the values of
`height` and `width`. To get the padding we want and still have the
element fit inside its containing block, we would either remove the
`height` and `width` declarations, explicitly set them both to `auto`,
or set `box-sizing` to `border-box`.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797058305296

The names of these properties make them fairly self-explanatory. What's
less obvious at first, but makes sense once you think about it, is that
values for all these properties cannot be negative.

The following styles will force the positioned element to be at least
`10em` wide by `20em` tall, as illustrated in
[Figure 10-29](#ch10.xhtml_setting_minimum_width_height){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
inset: 10% 10% 20% 50%; min-width: 10em; min-height: 20em;
```

</span>Setting a minimum width and height for a positioned element</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This isn't a very robust solution since it forces the element to be at
least a certain size regardless of the size of its containing block.
Here's a better one:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
inset: 10% 10% auto 50%; height: auto; min-width: 15em;
```

Here, the element should be 40% as wide as the containing block but can
never be less than `15em` wide. We've also changed the `bottom` and
`height` so that they're automatically determined. This will let the
element be as tall as necessary to display its content, no matter how
narrow it gets (never less than `15em`, though!).

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_862}

We'll look at the role `auto` plays in the height and width of
positioned elements in ["Placement and Sizing of Absolutely Positioned
Elements"](#ch10.xhtml_placement-and-sizing-of-absolutely-positioned-elements){data-type="xref"}.
:::

You can turn all this around to keep elements from getting too wide or
tall by using `max-width` and `max-height`. Let's imagine that, for some
reason, we want an element to have three-quarters the width of its
containing block but to stop getting wider when it hits 400 pixels. The
appropriate styles are as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
width: 75%; max-width: 400px;
```

One great advantage of the min-max properties is that they let you mix
units with relative safety. You can use percentage-based sizes while
setting length-based limits, or vice versa.

It's worth mentioning that these min-max properties can be very useful
in conjunction with floated elements. For example, we can allow a
floated element's width to be relative to the width of its parent
element (which is its containing block), while [making]{.keep-together}
sure that the float's width never goes below `10em`. The reverse
approach is also possible:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.aside {float: left; width: 40em; max-width: 40%;}
```

This will set the float to `40em` wide, unless that would be more than
40% the width of the containing block, in which case the float will be
limited to that 40% width.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_block_contain primary="blocks"
secondary="containing blocks" data-type="indexterm"}element is
positioned absolutely, it is completely removed from the document flow.
It is then positioned with respect to its closest positioned ancestor,
if any, otherwise its containing block, and its margin edges are placed
using the offset properties (`top`, `left`, `inset-inline-start`, etc.).
The positioned element does not flow around the content of other
elements, nor does their content flow around the positioned element.
This implies that an absolutely positioned element may overlap other
elements or be overlapped by them. (We'll see how to affect the
overlapping order later.)

The containing block for an absolutely positioned element is the nearest
ancestor element that has a `position` value other than `static`. It is
common for an author to pick an element that will serve as the
containing block for the absolutely positioned element and give it a
`position` of `relative` with no offsets, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.contain {position: relative;}
```

Consider the example in
[Figure 10-30](#ch10.xhtml_using_relative_positioning){data-type="xref"},
which illustrates the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {margin: 2em;}
p.contain {position: relative;} /* establish a containing block*/
b {position: absolute; inset: auto 0 0 auto;
    width: 8em; height: 5em; border: 1px solid gray;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<body>
<p>
    This paragraph does <em>not</em> establish a containing block for any of
    its descendant elements that are absolutely positioned. Therefore, the
    absolutely positioned <b>boldface</b> element it contains will be
    positioned with respect to the initial containing block.
</p>
<p class="contain">
    Thanks to <code>position: relative</code>, this paragraph establishes a
    containing block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely
    positioned. Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a
    boldfaced element that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect
    to its containing block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the
    element box generated by the paragraph.
</p>
</body>
```

The `<b>` elements in both paragraphs have been absolutely positioned.
The difference is in the containing block used for each one. The `<b>`
element in the first paragraph is positioned with respect to the initial
containing block, because all of its ancestor elements have a `position`
of `static`. The second paragraph has been set to `position: relative`,
so it establishes a containing block for its descendants.

</span>Using relative positioning to define containing blocks</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You've probably noted that in that second paragraph, the positioned
element overlaps some of the text content of the paragraph. There is no
way to avoid this, short of positioning the `<b>` element outside of the
paragraph or specifying a padding for the paragraph that is wide enough
to accommodate the positioned element. Also, since the `<b>` element has
a transparent background, the paragraph's text shows through the
positioned element. The only way to avoid this is to set a background
for the positioned element, or else move it out of the paragraph
entirely.

Assuming the containing block is the root element, you could drop in an
absolutely positioned paragraph, as follows, and get a result like that
shown in
[Figure 10-31](#ch10.xhtml_positioning_element_contained_by_root){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 25%; left: 25%; bottom:
    auto; width: 50%; height: auto; background: silver;">
    ...
</p>
```

The paragraph is now positioned at the very beginning of the document,
half as wide as the document's width and overwriting other content.

An important point to highlight is that when an element is absolutely
positioned, it establishes a containing block for its descendant
elements. For example, we can absolutely position an element and then
absolutely position one of its children by using the following styles
and basic markup (depicted in
[Figure 10-32](#ch10.xhtml_containing_blocks_from_absolute_pos){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {position: relative; width: 100%; height: 10em;
    border: 1px solid; background: #EEE;}
div.a {position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; width: 15em; height: 100%;
    margin-left: auto; background: #CCC;}
div.b {position: absolute; bottom: 0; left: 0; width: 10em; height: 50%;
    margin-top: auto; background: #AAA;}

<div>
    <div class="a">
        absolutely positioned element A
        <div class="b">
            absolutely positioned element B
        </div>
    </div>
    containing block
</div>
```

Remember that if the []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797057550880
primary="scrolling" secondary="absolutely positioned elements"
data-type="indexterm"}document is scrolled, the absolutely positioned
elements will scroll right along with it. This is true of all absolutely
positioned elements that are not descendants of fixed-position or
sticky-position elements.

This happens because, eventually, the elements are positioned in
relation to something that's part of the normal flow. For example, if
you absolutely position a table, and its containing block is the initial
containing block, then the positioned table will scroll because the
initial containing block is part of the normal flow, and thus it
scrolls.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797057549520 primary=""

## Placement and Sizing of Absolutely Positioned Elements {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_869}

Combining the concepts of placement and sizing may seem odd, but it's a
necessity with absolutely positioned elements because the specification
binds them closely together. This is not such a strange pairing, upon
reflection. Consider what happens if an element is positioned using the
four physical offset properties, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#masthead h1 {position: absolute; inset: 1em 25% 10px 1em;
    margin: 0; padding: 0; background: silver;}
```

Here, the height and width of the `<h1>`'s element box is determined by
the placement of its outer margin edges, as shown in
[Figure 10-33](#ch10.xhtml_determining_height_based_on_offset){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_determining_height_based_on_offset" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_870"><span class="label">Figure 10-33.
</span>Determining the height of an element based on the offset
properties</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If the containing block were made taller, the `<h1>` would also become
taller; if the containing block were narrowed, the `<h1>` would become
narrower. If we were to add margins or padding to the `<h1>`, that would
have further effects on its calculated height and width.

But what if we do all that and then also try to set an explicit height
and width?

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#masthead h1 {position: absolute; top: 0; left: 1em; right: 10%; bottom: 0;
    margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 1em; width: 50%; background: silver;}
```

Something has to give, because it's incredibly unlikely that all those
values will be accurate. In fact, the containing block would have to be
exactly two and a half times as wide as the `<h1>`'s computed value of
`font-size` for all of the shown values to be accurate. Any other
`width` would mean at least one value is wrong and has to be ignored.
Figuring out which one depends on multiple factors, and the factors
change depending on whether an element is replaced or nonreplaced. (See
[Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"}
for replaced versus nonreplaced [elements.)]{.keep-together}

For that matter, consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#masthead h1 {position: absolute; top: auto; left: auto;}
```

What should the result be? As it happens, the answer is *not* "reset the
values to 0." We'll see the actual answer, starting in the next section.

primary="absolute positioning" secondary="auto-edges"
data-type="indexterm"}absolutely positioning an element, a special
behavior applies when any of the offset properties other than `bottom`
are set to `auto`. Let's take `top` as an example. Consider the
following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>
    When we consider the effect of positioning, it quickly becomes clear that
    authors can do a great deal of damage to layout, just as they can do very
    interesting things.<span style="position: absolute; top: auto;
    left: 0;">[4]</span> This is usually the case with useful technologies:
    the sword always has at least two edges, both of them sharp.
</p>
```

What should happen? For `left`, the left edge of the
[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797057304256 primary="positioning"
secondary="static"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797057259760
primary="static positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797057259088 primary="offsets"
secondary="static positioning" data-type="indexterm"}element should be
placed against the left edge of its containing block (which we'll assume
here to be the initial containing block).

For `top`, however, something much more interesting happens. The top of
the positioned element should line up with the place where its top would
have been if it were not positioned at all. In other words, imagine
where the `<span>` would have been placed if its `position` value were
`static`; this is its *static position*---the place where its top edge
should be calculated to sit. Therefore, we should get the result shown
in
[Figure 10-34](#ch10.xhtml_using_static_top_for_absolute_pos){data-type="xref"}.

</div>
</figure>

The "\[4\]" sits just outside the paragraph's content because the
initial containing block's left edge is to the left of the paragraph's
left edge.

The same basic rules hold true for `left` and `right` being set to
`auto`. In those cases, the left (or right) edge of a positioned element
lines up with the spot where the edge would have been placed if the
element weren't positioned. So let's modify our previous example so that
both `top` and `left` are set to `auto`:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>
    When we consider the effect of positioning, it quickly becomes clear that
    authors can do a great deal of damage to layout, just as they can do very

    auto;">[4]</span> This is usually the case with useful technologies:
    the sword always has at least two edges, both of them sharp.

```

This results in

</div>
</figure>

The "\[4\]" now sits right where it would have were it not positioned.
Note that, since it *is* positioned, its normal-flow space is closed up.
This causes the positioned element to overlap the normal-flow content.

This auto-placement works only in certain situations, generally wherever
there are few constraints on the other dimensions of a positioned
element. Our previous example could be auto-placed because it had no
constraints on its height or width, nor on the placement of the bottom
and right edges. But suppose, for some reason, there had been such
constraints. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>

    authors can do a great deal of damage to layout, just as they can do very

    technologies: the sword always has at least two edges, both of them sharp.

happens is the subject of the next

## Placing and Sizing Nonreplaced Elements {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_874}

In general, the size and []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_pos_nonrep
primary="positioning" secondary="nonreplaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_absol_pos_nonrep
primary="absolute positioning" secondary="nonreplaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}placement of an element depends on its containing
block. The values of its various properties (`width`, `right`,
`padding-left`, and so on) affect its layout, but the foundation is the
containing block.

Consider the width and horizontal placement of a positioned element. It
can be represented as an equation that states the following:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
left + margin-left + border-left-width + padding-left + width +
padding-right + border-right-width + margin-right + right =
the width of the containing block
```

This calculation is fairly reasonable. It's basically the equation that
determines how block-level elements in the normal flow are sized, except
it adds `left` and `right` to the mix. So how do all these interact? We
have a series of rules to work through.

First, if `left`, `width`, and `right` are all set to `auto`, you get
the result seen in the previous section: the left edge is placed at its
static position, assuming a left-to-right language. In right-to-left
languages, the right edge is placed at its static position. The width of
the element is set to be "shrink to fit," which means the element's
content area is made only as wide as necessary to contain its content.
The nonstatic position property (`right` in left-to-right languages,
`left` in right-to-left) is set to take up the remaining distance. For
[example:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="position: relative; width: 25em; border: 1px dotted;">
    An absolutely positioned element can have its content <span style="position:
    absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: auto; width: auto; background:
    silver;">shrink-wrapped</span> thanks to the way positioning rules work.
</div>
```

This results in
[Figure 10-36](#ch10.xhtml_shrink-to-fit){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_shrink-to-fit" class="figure">

</span>The “shrink-to-fit” behavior of absolutely positioned
elements</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The top of the element is placed against the top of its containing block
(the `<div>`, in this case), and the width of the element is just as
wide as is needed to contain the content. The remaining distance from
the right edge of the element to the right edge of the containing block
becomes the computed value of `right`.

Now suppose that only the left and right margins are set to `auto`, not
`left`, `width`, and `right`, as in this example:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="position: relative; width: 25em; border: 1px dotted;">
    An absolutely positioned element can have its content <span style="position:
    absolute; top: 0; left: 1em; right: 1em; width: 10em; margin: 0 auto;
    background: silver;">shrink-wrapped</span> thanks to the way positioning
    rules work.
</div>
```

What happens here is that the left and right margins, which are both
`auto`, are set to be equal. This will effectively center the element,
as shown in
[Figure 10-37](#ch10.xhtml_horizontally_centering_with_auto_margins){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_horizontally_centering_with_auto_margins"

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_876"><span class="label">Figure 10-37.
</span>Horizontally centering an absolutely positioned element with
<span class="keep-together"><code>auto</code> margins</span></h6>
</div>
</figure>

This is basically the same as `auto`-margin centering in the normal
flow. So let's make the margins something other than `auto`:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="position: relative; width: 25em; border: 1px dotted;">
    An absolutely positioned element can have its content <span style="position:
    absolute; top: 0; left: 1em; right: 1em; width: 10em; margin-left: 1em;
    margin-right: 1em; background: silver;">shrink-wrapped</span> thanks to the
    way positioning rules work.
</div>
```

Now we have a problem. The positioned `<span>`'s properties add up to
only `14em`, whereas the containing block is `25em` wide. That's an
11-em deficit we have to make up somewhere.

The rules state that, in this case, the user agent ignores the value for
the inline-end side of the element and solves for that. In other words,
the result will be the same as if we'd declared this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<span style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 1em;
right: 12em; width: 10em; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;
right: auto; background: silver;">shrink-wrapped</span>
```

This results in
[Figure 10-38](#ch10.xhtml_ignoring_value_for_right){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_ignoring_value_for_right" class="figure">

</span>Ignoring the value for <code>right</code> in an overconstrained
situation</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If one of the margins had been set to `auto`, that would have been
changed instead. Suppose we change the styles to state the following:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<span style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 1em;
right: 1em; width: 10em; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: auto;
background: silver;">shrink-wrapped</span>
```

The visual result would be the same as that in
[Figure 10-38](#ch10.xhtml_ignoring_value_for_right){data-type="xref"},
only it would be attained by computing the right margin to `12em`
instead of overriding the value assigned to the property `right`.

If, on the other hand, we made the left margin `auto`, *it* would be
reset, as illustrated in
[Figure 10-39](#ch10.xhtml_ignoring_margin-right){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<span style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 1em;
right: 1em; width: 10em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: 1em;
background: silver;">shrink-wrapped</span>
```

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_878"><span class="label">Figure 10-39.
</span>Making use of an <code>auto</code> left margin</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In general, if only one of the properties is set to `auto`, that
property will be used to satisfy [the equation]{.keep-together} given
earlier in the section. Thus, given the following styles, the element's
width would expand to whatever size is needed, instead of
"shrink-wrapping" the content:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<span style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 1em;
right: 1em; width: auto; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;
background: silver;">not shrink-wrapped</span>
```

So far we've really examined behavior only along the horizontal axis,
but very similar rules hold true along the vertical axis. If we take the
previous discussion and rotate it 90 degrees, as it were, we get almost
the same behavior. For example, the following markup results in
[Figure 10-40](#ch10.xhtml_vertical_layout_behavior){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="position: relative; width: 30em; height: 10em; border: 1px solid;">
    <div style="position: absolute; left: 0; width: 30%;
        background: #CCC; top: 0;">
            element A
    </div>
    <div style="position: absolute; left: 35%; width: 30%;
        background: #AAA; top: 0; height: 50%;">
            element B
    </div>
    <div style="position: absolute; left: 70%; width: 30%;
        background: #CCC; height: 50%; bottom: 0;">
            element C
    </div>
</div>
```

In the first case, the height of the element is shrink-wrapped to the
content. In the second, the unspecified property (`bottom`) is set to
make up the distance between the bottom of the positioned element and
the bottom of its containing block. In the third case, `top` is
unspecified, and therefore used to make up the difference.

</span>Vertical layout behavior for absolutely positioned elements</h6>

For that matter, auto-margins can lead to vertical centering. Given the
following styles, the absolutely positioned `<div>` will be vertically
centered within its containing block, as shown in
[Figure 10-41](#ch10.xhtml_vertically_centering_with_auto_margins){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

    <div style="position: absolute; left: 0; width: 100%; background: #CCC;
        top: 0; height: 5em; bottom: 0; margin: auto 0;">

There are two small variations to point out. In horizontal layout,
either `right` or `left` can be placed according to the static position
if their values are `auto`. In vertical layout, only `top` can take on
the static position; `bottom`, for whatever reason, cannot.

Also, if an absolutely positioned element's size is overconstrained in
the vertical direction, `bottom` is ignored. Thus, in the following
situation, the declared value of `bottom` would be overridden by the
calculated value of `5em`:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="position: relative; width: 10em; height: 10em; border: 1px solid;">
    <div style="position: absolute; left: 0; width: 100%; background: #CCC;
        top: 0; height: 5em; bottom: 0; margin: 0;">
            element D
    </div>
</div>
```

There is no provision for `top` to be ignored if the properties are
overconstrained.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797056467056 primary=""

primary="replaced elements" secondary="positioning"

primary="absolute positioning" secondary="replaced elements"
data-type="indexterm"}rules are different for replaced elements (e.g.,
images) than they are for nonreplaced elements. This is because replaced
elements have an intrinsic height and width, and therefore are not
altered unless explicitly changed by the author. Thus, there is no
concept of "shrink to fit" in the positioning of replaced elements.

The behaviors that go into placing and sizing replaced elements are most
easily expressed by this series of rules, to be taken one after the
other:

1.  If `width` is set to `auto`, the used value of `width` is determined
    by the intrinsic width of the element's content. Thus, if an image
    is intrinsically 50 pixels wide, the used value is calculated to be
    `50px`. If `width` is explicitly declared (that is, something like
    `100px` or `50%`), the width is set to that value.

2.  If `left` has the value `auto` in a left-to-right language, replace
    `auto` with the static position. In right-to-left languages, replace
    an `auto` value for `right` with the static position.

3.  If either `left` or `right` is still `auto` (in other words, it
    hasn't been replaced in a previous step), replace any `auto` on
    `margin-left` or `margin-right` with `0`.

4.  If, at this point, both `margin-left` and `margin-right` are still
    defined to be `auto`, set them to be equal, thus centering the
    element in its containing block.

5.  After all that, if only one `auto` value is left, change it to equal
    the remainder of the equation.

This leads to the same basic behaviors you saw with absolutely
positioned nonreplaced elements, as long as you assume that there is an
explicit `width` for the nonreplaced element. Therefore, the following
two elements will have the same width and placement, assuming the
image's intrinsic width is 100 pixels (see
[Figure 10-42](#ch10.xhtml_absolutely_positioning_replaced_element){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

    <img src="frown.gif" alt="a frowny face"
        style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 50px; margin: 0;">
</div>
<div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 50px;
        width: 100px; height: 100px; margin: 0;">
    it's a div!

As with nonreplaced elements, if the values are overconstrained, the
user agent is supposed to ignore the value on the inline-end side:
`right` in left-to-right languages and `left` in right-to-left
languages. Thus, in the following example, the declared value for
`right` is overridden with a computed value of `50px`:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div style="position: relative; width: 300px;">
    <img src="frown.gif" alt="a frowny face" style="position: absolute; top: 0;
        left: 50px; right: 125px; width: 200px; margin: 0;">
</div>
```

Similarly, layout along the vertical axis is governed by this series of
rules:

1.  If `height` is set to `auto`, the computed value of `height` is
    determined by the intrinsic height of the element's content. Thus,
    the height of an image 50 pixels tall is computed to be `50px`. If
    `height` is explicitly declared (that is, something like `100px` or
    `50%`), the height is set to that value.

2.  If `top` has the value `auto`, replace it with the replaced
    element's static position.

3.  If `bottom` has a value of `auto`, replace any `auto` value on
    `margin-top` or `margin-bottom` with `0`.

4.  If, at this point, both `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` are still
    defined to be `auto`, set them to be equal, thus centering the
    element in its containing block.

5.  After all that, if only one `auto` value is left, change it to equal
    the remainder of the equation.

As with nonreplaced elements, if the values are overconstrained, the
user agent is supposed to ignore the value for
`bottom`.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797056325344 primary=""
startref="ix_absol_pos_rep"

## Placement on the Z-Axis {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_884}

With all of the []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_zindex_prop primary="z-index property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_absol_pos_zindex
primary="absolute positioning" secondary="z-index placement"
data-type="indexterm"}positioning going on, there will inevitably be a
situation where two elements will try to exist in the same place,
visually speaking. One of them will have to overlap the other---so how
do we control which element comes out "on top"? This is where
[`z-index`]{.keep-together} comes in.

This property lets you alter the way that elements overlap one another.
It takes its name from the coordinate system in which side-to-side is
the x-axis and top-to-bottom is the y-axis. In such a case, the third
axis---which runs from back to front, as you look at the display
surface---is termed the *z-axis*. Thus, elements are given values along
this axis by using `z-index`.
[Figure 10-44](#ch10.xhtml_conceptual_view_of_zindex){data-type="xref"}
illustrates this system.

</span>A conceptual view of z-index stacking</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_stack_elem primary="stacking of elements"
data-type="indexterm"}coordinate system, an element with a higher
`z-index` value is closer to the reader than those with lower `z-index`
values. This will cause the high-value element to overlap the others, as
illustrated in
[Figure 10-45](#ch10.xhtml_how_elements_are_stacked){data-type="xref"},
which is a "head-on" view of
[Figure 10-44](#ch10.xhtml_conceptual_view_of_zindex){data-type="xref"}.
This precedence of overlapping is referred to as *stacking*.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_how_elements_are_stacked" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1045.png" width="600" height="400"

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_887"><span class="label">Figure 10-45.
</span>How the elements are stacked</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Any integer can be used as a value for `z-index`, including negative
numbers. Assigning an element a negative `z-index` will move it further
away from the reader; that is, it will be moved lower in the stack.
Consider the following styles, illustrated in
[Figure 10-46](#ch10.xhtml_stacked_elements_can_overlap){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {background: rgba(255,255,255,0.9); border: 1px solid;}
p#first {position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;
    width: 40%; height: 10em; z-index: 8;}
p#second {position: absolute; top: -0.75em; left: 15%;
    width: 60%; height: 5.5em; z-index: 4;}
p#third {position: absolute; top: 23%; left: 25%;
    width: 30%; height: 10em; z-index: 1;}
p#fourth {position: absolute; top: 10%; left: 10%;
    width: 80%; height: 10em; z-index: 0;}
```

Each of the elements is positioned according to its styles, but the
usual order of stacking is altered by the `z-index` values. Assuming the
paragraphs were in numeric order, a reasonable stacking order would have
been, from lowest to highest, `p#first`, `p#second`, `p#third`,
`p#fourth`. This would have put `p#first` behind the other three
elements, and `p#fourth` in front of the others. Thanks to `z-index`,
the stacking order is under your control.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_stacked_elements_can_overlap" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1046.png" width="600" height="346"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_888"><span class="label">Figure 10-46.
</span>Stacked elements can overlap</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As the previous example demonstrates, the `z-index` values don't need to
be contiguous. You can assign any integer of any size. If you want to be
fairly certain that an element stays in front of everything else, you
might use a rule along the lines of `z-index: 100000`. This would work
as expected in most cases---although if you ever declared another
element's `z-index` to be `100001` (or higher), it would appear in
front.

Once you assign an element a value for `z-index` (other than `auto`),
that element establishes its own local *stacking context*. This means
that all of the element's descendants have their own stacking order,
except relative to their ancestor element. This is very similar to the
way that elements establish new containing blocks. Given the following
styles, you would see something like
[Figure 10-47](#ch10.xhtml_local_stacking_from_positioned){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {border: 1px solid; background: #DDD; margin: 0;}
#one {position: absolute; top: 1em; left: 0;
    width: 40%; height: 10em; z-index: 3;}
#two {position: absolute; top: -0.75em; left: 15%;
    width: 60%; height: 5.5em; z-index: 10;}
#three {position: absolute; top: 10%; left: 30%;
    width: 30%; height: 10em; z-index: 8;}
p[id] em {position: absolute; top: -1em; left: -1em;
    width: 10em; height: 5em;}
#one em {z-index: 100; background: hsla(0,50%,70%,0.9);}
#two em {z-index: 10; background: hsla(120,50%,70%,0.9);}
#three em {z-index: -343; background: hsla(240,50%,70%,0.9);}
```

</span>Positioned elements establish local stacking contexts</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note where the `<em>` elements fall in the stacking order (you can find
a list of the various ways to establish a stacking context in ["Blending
in
Isolation"](../Text/ch20.xhtml#blending-in-isolation1){data-type="xref"}
in
[Chapter 20](../Text/ch20.xhtml#filters-compositing){data-type="xref"}).
Each is correctly layered with respect to its parent element. Each
`<em>` is drawn in front of its parent element, whether or not its
`z-index` is negative, and parents and children are grouped together
like layers in an editing program. (The specification keeps children
from being drawn behind their parents when using `z-index` stacking, so
the `em` in `p#three` is drawn on top of `p#one`, even though its
`z-index` value is `-343`.) This is because its `z-index` value is taken
with respect to its local stacking context: its containing block. That
containing block, in turn, has a `z-index`, which operates within its
local stacking context.

We have one more `z-index` value to examine. The CSS specification has
this to say about the default value, `auto`:

> The stack level of the generated box in the current stacking context
> is 0. The box does not establish a new stacking context unless it is
> the root element.

So, any element with `z-index: auto` can be treated as though it is set
to `z-index: 0`.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797055651312 primary=""
startref="ix_stack_elem" data-type="indexterm"}

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_890}

`z-index` is also honored by flex and grid items, even though they are
not positioned using the `position` property. The rules are essentially
the same.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797055648944 primary=""

# Fixed Positioning {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_891}

As implied in a []{#ch10.xhtml_ix_pos_fixed primary="positioning"

primary="fixed positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_offset_fix_pos primary="offsets"

*fixed positioning* is just like absolute positioning, except the
containing block of a fixed element is the *viewport*. A
[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797055638464 primary="containing blocks"

data-type="indexterm"}fixed-position [element]{.keep-together} is
totally removed from the document's flow and does not have a position
relative to any part of [the document.]{.keep-together}

Fixed positioning can be exploited in interesting ways. First off, it's
possible to create frame-style interfaces by using fixed positioning.
Consider
[Figure 10-48](#ch10.xhtml_emulating_frames_with_fixed){data-type="xref"},
which shows a common layout scheme.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_emulating_frames_with_fixed" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1048.png" width="600" height="332"

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_892"><span class="label">Figure 10-48.
</span>Emulating frames with fixed positioning</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This could be done using the following styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header {position: fixed; top: 0; bottom: 80%; left: 20%; right: 0;
    background: gray;}
div#sidebar {position: fixed; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 80%;
    background: silver;}
```

This will fix the header and sidebar to the top and side of the
viewport, where they will remain regardless of how the document is
scrolled. The drawback here, though, is that the rest of the document
will be overlapped by the fixed elements. Therefore, the rest of the
content should probably be contained in its own wrapper element and
employ something like the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {position: absolute; top: 20%; bottom: 0; left: 20%; right: 0;
    overflow: scroll; background: white;}
```

It would even be possible to create small gaps between the three
positioned elements by adding some appropriate margins, as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background: black; color: silver;} /* colors for safety's sake */
div#header {position: fixed; top: 0; bottom: 80%; left: 20%; right: 0;
    background: gray; margin-bottom: 2px; color: yellow;}
div#sidebar {position: fixed; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 80%;
    background: silver; margin-right: 2px; color: maroon;}
div#main {position: absolute; top: 20%; bottom: 0; left: 20%; right: 0;
    overflow: auto; background: white; color: black;}
```

Given such a case, a tiled image could be applied to the `<body>`
background. This image would show through the gaps created by the
margins, which could certainly be widened if the author saw fit.

Another use for fixed positioning is to place a "persistent" element on
the screen, like a short list of links. We could create a persistent
`footer` with copyright and other information as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
footer {position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%; height: auto;}
```

This would place the `footer` element at the bottom of the viewport and
leave it there no matter how much the document is scrolled.

Many of the layout cases for fixed positioning, besides "persistent
elements," are handled as well, if not better, by grid layout (see

more).[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797055283104 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_rel_position

to understand is *relative positioning*.
[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_offset_position4 primary="offsets"
secondary="relative positioning" data-type="indexterm"}In this scheme, a
positioned element is shifted by use of the offset properties. However,
this can have some interesting consequences.

On the surface, it seems simple enough. Suppose we want to shift an
image up and to the left.
[Figure 10-49](#ch10.xhtml_relatively_positioned_element){data-type="xref"}
shows the result of these styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {position: relative; top: -20px; left: -20px;}

All we've done here is offset the image's top-edge 20 pixels upward and
offset the left-edge 20 pixels to the left. However, notice the blank
space where the image would have been had it not been positioned. This
happened because when an element is relatively positioned, it's shifted
from its normal place, but the space it would have occupied [doesn't
disappear.]{.keep-together}

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_896}

Relative positioning is very similar to translation element transforms,
which are discussed in
[Chapter 17](../Text/ch17.xhtml#transforms){data-type="xref"}.
:::

Consider the results of the following styles, which are depicted in
[Figure 10-50](#ch10.xhtml_another_relatively_positioned_element){data-type="xref"}:

</span>Another relatively positioned element</h6>

</figure>

As you can see, the paragraph has some blank space in it. This is where
the `<em>` element would have been, and the layout of the `<em>` element
in its new position exactly mirrors the space it left behind.

It's also possible to shift a relatively positioned element to overlap
other content. For example, the following styles and markup are
illustrated in
[Figure 10-51](#ch10.xhtml_relatively_positioned_elements_overlap_content){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.slide {position: relative; left: 30px;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>
    In this paragraph, we will find that there is an image that has been
    pushed to the right. It will therefore <img src="star.gif" alt="A star!"
    class="slide"> overlap content nearby, assuming that it is not the
    last element in its line box.

</span>Relatively positioned elements can overlap other content</h6>

Relative positioning has one interesting wrinkle. What happens when a
relatively positioned element is overconstrained? For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {position: relative; top: 10px; bottom: 20px;}
```

Here we have values that call for two very different behaviors. If we
consider only `top: 10px`, the element should be shifted downward 10
pixels, but `bottom: 20px` clearly calls for the element to be shifted
upward 20 pixels.

CSS states that when it comes to []{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797055028160
primary="overconstraining" secondary="relative positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}overconstrained relative positioning, one value is
reset to be the negative of the other. Thus, `bottom` would always equal
`-top`. This means the previous example would be treated as though it
had been the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {position: relative; top: 10px; bottom: -10px;}
```

Therefore, the `<strong>` element will be shifted downward 10 pixels.
The specification also makes allowances for writing directions. In
relative positioning, `right` always equals `-left` in left-to-right
languages; but in right-to-left languages, this is reversed: `left`
always equals `-right`.

[]{#ch10.xhtml_ix_scroll_sticky primary="scrolling"
secondary="sticky positioning and" data-type="indexterm"}scroll through
an alphabetized list of artists, the current letter stays stuck at the
top of the window until a new letter section is entered, at which point
the new letter replaces the old. It's a little hard to show in print,
but [Figure 10-52](#ch10.xhtml_sticky_positioning){data-type="xref"}
takes a stab at it by showing three points in a scroll.

</span>Sticky positioning</h6>
</div>
</figure>

CSS makes this sort of thing possible by declaring an element to be
`position: sticky`, but (as usual) there's more to it than that.

First off, the offsets (`top`, `left`, etc.) are used to define a
*sticky-positioning rectangle* with relation to the containing block.
Take the following as an example. It will have the effect shown in
[Figure 10-53](#ch10.xhtml_sticky-positioning_rectangle){data-type="xref"},
where the dashed line shows where the sticky-positioning [rectangle is
created:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#scrollbox {overflow: scroll; width: 15em; height: 18em;}
#scrollbox h2 {position: sticky; top: 2em; bottom: auto;
    left: auto; right: auto;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_sticky-positioning_rectangle" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1053.png" width="600" height="500"
alt="css5 1053" />
<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_902"><span class="label">Figure 10-53.
</span>The sticky-positioning rectangle</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the `<h2>` is in the middle of the rectangle in
[Figure 10-53](#ch10.xhtml_sticky-positioning_rectangle){data-type="xref"}.
That's its place in the normal flow of the content inside the
`#scrollbox` element. The only way to make the `<h2>` sticky is to
scroll that content until the top of the `<h2>` touches the top of the
sticky-positioning rectangle (which is `2em` below the top of the
scrollbox)---at which point, the `<h2>` will stick there. This is
illustrated in
[Figure 10-54](#ch10.xhtml_sticking_to_the_top){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_sticking_to_the_top" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1054.png" width="600" height="209"

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_903"><span class="label">Figure 10-54.
</span>Sticking to the top of the sticky-positioning rectangle</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In other words, the `<h2>` sits in the normal flow until its sticky edge
touches the sticky edge of the sticky-positioning rectangle. At that
point, it sticks there as if absolutely [positioned,]{.keep-together}
*except* that it leaves behind the space it otherwise would have
occupied in the normal flow.

You may have noticed that the `#scrollbox` element doesn't have a
`position` declaration. One isn't hiding offstage, either: it's the
`overflow: scroll` set on `#scrollbox` that creates a containing block
for the sticky-positioned `<h2>` elements. This is a case where a
containing block isn't determined by `position`.

If the scrolling is reversed so that the `<h2>`'s normal-flow position
moves lower than the top of the rectangle, the `<h2>` is detached from
the rectangle and resumes its place in the normal flow. This is shown in
[Figure 10-55](#ch10.xhtml_detaching_from_the_top){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_detaching_from_the_top" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1055.png" width="600" height="209"

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_904"><span class="label">Figure 10-55.
</span>Detaching from the top of the sticky-positioning rectangle</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note that the reason the `<h2>` sticks to the *top* of the rectangle in
these examples is that the value of `top` is set to something other than
`auto` for the `<h2>` (that is, for the sticky-positioned element). You
can use whatever offset side you want. For example, you could have
elements stick to the bottom of the rectangle as you scroll downward
through the content. The following code is illustrated in
[Figure 10-56](#ch10.xhtml_sticking_to_the_bottom){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#scrollbox {overflow: scroll; position: relative; width: 15em; height: 10em;}
#scrollbox h2 {position: sticky; top: auto; bottom: 0; left: auto; right: auto;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_sticking_to_the_bottom" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1056.png" width="600" height="209"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_905"><span class="label">Figure 10-56.
</span>Sticking to the bottom of the sticky-positioning rectangle</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This could be a way to show footnotes or comments for a given paragraph,
for example, while allowing them to scroll away as the paragraph moves
upward. The same rules apply for the left and right sides, which is
useful for side-scrolling content.

If you define more than one offset property to have a value other than
`auto`, *all* of them will become sticky edges. For example, this set of
styles will force the `<h2>` to always appear inside the scrollbox,
regardless of which way its content is scrolled (see
[Figure 10-57](#ch10.xhtml_making_every_side_sticky){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#scrollbox {overflow: scroll; : 15em; height: 10em;}
#scrollbox h2 {position: sticky; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch10.xhtml_making_every_side_sticky" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1057.png" width="600" height="209"

<h6 id="ch10.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_906"><span class="label">Figure 10-57.
</span>Making every side a sticky side</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You might wonder: what happens if I have multiple sticky-positioned
elements in a situation like this, and I scroll past two or more? In
effect, they pile up on top of one another:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#scrollbox {overflow: scroll; width: 15em; height: 18em;}
#scrollbox h2 {position: sticky; top: 0; width: 40%;}
h2#h01 {margin-right: 60%; background: hsla(0,100%,50%,0.75);}
h2#h02 {margin-left: 60%; background: hsla(120,100%,50%,0.75);}
h2#h03 {margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
    background: hsla(240,100%,50%,0.75);}
```

It's not easy to see in static images like
[Figure 10-58](#ch10.xhtml_sticky-header_pileup){data-type="xref"}, but
the way the headers are piling up is that the later they are in the
source, the closer they are to the viewer.
[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797054561616 primary="z-index property"
data-type="indexterm"}This is the usual `z-index` behavior---which means
that you can decide which sticky elements sit on top of others by
assigning explicit `z-index` values. For example, suppose we want the
first sticky element in our content to sit atop all the others. By
giving it `z-index: 1000`{.keep-together}, or any other sufficiently
high number, it would sit on top of all the other sticky elements that
are stuck in the same place.[]{#ch10.xhtml_idm45797054559136 primary=""

would be of the other elements "sliding under" the topmost element.

As you saw in this chapter, CSS offers numerous ways to affect the
placement of basic elements. Floats may be a fundamentally simple aspect
of CSS, but that doesn't keep them from being useful and powerful. They
fill a vital and honorable niche, allowing the placement of content to
one side while the rest of the content flows around it.

Thanks to positioning, it's possible to move elements around in ways
that the normal flow could never accommodate. Combined with the stacking
possibilities of the z-axis and the various overflow patterns, there's
still a lot to like in positioning, even in a time when flexbox and grid
layout are available to us.

galleries almost simple. With flexbox, you often don't need a CSS
framework. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use just a few lines of
CSS to create almost any feature your site requires.

# Flexbox Fundamentals {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_909}

*Flexbox* is a simple and powerful way to lay out page components by
dictating how space is distributed, content is aligned, and elements are
visually ordered. Content can easily be arranged vertically or
horizontally, and can be laid out along a single axis or wrapped across
multiple lines. And much, much more.

With flexbox, the appearance of content can be independent of source
order. Though visually altered, flex properties should not impact the
order of content read by screen [readers.]{.keep-together}

Specifications say that []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797054542064

of late 2022, Firefox follows the visual order. As of this writing, a
proposal calls for adding a CSS property that specifies whether to
follow source or visual order, so it may soon be possible to decide for
yourself.

Perhaps most importantly, with flexible box module layouts, elements can
be made to behave predictably for different screen sizes and different
display devices. Flexbox works very well with responsive sites, as
content can increase and decrease in size when the space provided is
increased or decreased.

Flexbox works off of a parent-and-child relationship. Flexbox layout is
activated by declaring `display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` on an
element. This []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flexbox_item
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="flex items"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flexbox_container
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="flex containers"
data-type="indexterm"}element becomes a *flex container*, arranging its
children within the space provided and controlling their layout. The
children of this flex container become *flex items*. Consider the
following styles and markup, illustrated in
[Figure 11-1](#ch11.xhtml_display_flex){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#one {display: flex;}

```

:::

Notice how each child element of the `<div>`s becomes a flex item, and
furthermore, how they all lay out in the same way? It doesn't matter
that some are paragraphs and others are `<span>`s. They all become flex
items. (There would likely have been some differences due to the
paragraphs' browser-default margins, except those were removed.)

The only real difference between the first and second flex containers is
that one is set to `display: flex`, and the other to
`display: inline-flex`. In the first, the `<div>` becomes a block box
with flex layout inside it. In the second, the `<div>` becomes an
inline-block box with flex inside it.

The key thing to keep in mind is that once you set an element to be a
flex container, like the `<div>`s in
[Figure 11-1](#ch11.xhtml_display_flex){data-type="xref"}, it will flex
only its immediate children, and not further descendants. However, you
can make those descendants flex containers as well, enabling some really
complex layouts.

Within a []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797054355328 primary="main-axis, flexbox"
data-type="indexterm"}flex container, items line up on the *main-axis*.
The main-axis can be either horizontal or vertical, so you can arrange
items into columns or rows. The main-axis takes on the directionality
set via the writing mode: this main-axis concept is discussed in depth
in ["Understanding
Axes"](#ch11.xhtml_understanding-axis){data-type="xref"}.

As the first `<div>` in
[Figure 11-1](#ch11.xhtml_display_flex){data-type="xref"} demonstrates,
when the flex items don't fill up the entire main-axis (in this case,
the width) of the container, they will leave extra space. Certain
properties dictate how to handle that extra space, which we'll explore
later in the chapter. You can group the children to the left, the right,
or centered, or you can spread them out, defining how the space is
spread out either between or around the children.

Besides distributing space, you can also allow the flex items to grow to
take up all the available space by distributing that extra space among
one, some, or all of the flex items. If there isn't enough space to
contain all the flex items, you can employ flexbox properties to dictate
how they should shrink to fit within their container, or whether they're
allowed to wrap to multiple flex lines.

Furthermore, the children can be aligned with respect to their container
or to each other; to the bottom, top, or center of the container; or
stretched out to fill the container. Regardless of the difference in
content length among sibling containers, with flexbox you can make all
the siblings the same size with a single
declaration.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797054350720 primary=""
startref="ix_flexbox_container"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797054349744 primary=""

::: {#ch11.xhtml_idm45797054348672 .sect2}
## A Simple Example {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_913}

Let's say we want to create a navigation bar out of a group of links.
This is exactly the sort of thing flexbox was designed to handle.
Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav {
  display: flex;
}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<nav>
   <a href="/">Home</a>
   <a href="/about">About</a>
   <a href="/blog">Blog</a>
   <a href="/jobs">Careers</a>
   <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a>
</nav>
```

In the preceding code, with its `display` property set to `flex`, the
`<nav>` element is turned into a flex container, and its child links are
all flex items. These links are still hyperlinks, but they are now also
flex items, which means they are no longer inline-level boxes: rather,
they participate in their container's flex formatting context.
Therefore, the whitespace between the `<a>` elements in the HTML is
completely ignored in layout terms. If you've ever used HTML comments to
suppress the space between links, list items, or other elements, you
know why this is a big deal.

So let's add some CSS to the links:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav {
  display: flex;
  border-block-end: 1px solid #ccc;
}
a {
  margin: 0 5px;
  padding: 5px 15px;
  border-radius: 3px 3px 0 0;
  background-color: #ddaa00;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #ffffff;
}
a:hover, a:focus, a:active {
  background-color: #ffcc22;
  color: black;
}
```

We now have ourselves a simple tabbed navigation bar, as shown in
[Figure 11-2](#ch11.xhtml_simple_tabbed_navigation){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_simple_tabbed_navigation" class="figure">

That might not seem like much right now, because there's nothing here
you couldn't have done with old-school CSS. Just wait: it gets better.

By design, flexbox is []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797054180112

primary="writing modes (flow direction)"
secondary="flexbox as agnostic to"
data-type="indexterm"}direction-agnostic. This is different from block
or inline layouts, which are defined to be vertically and horizontally
biased, respectively. The web was originally designed for the creation
of pages on monitors, and assumed a horizontal constraint with infinite
vertical scroll. This vertically biased layout is insufficient for
modern applications that change orientation, grow, and shrink, depending
on the user agent and the direction of the viewport, and change writing
modes depending on the language.

For years we joked about the challenges of vertical centering and
multiple column layout. Some layouts were no laughing matter, like
ensuring equal heights in sets of multiple side-by-side boxes, with
buttons or "more" links fixed to the bottom of each box
([Figure 11-3](#ch11.xhtml_power_grid_layout_flexbox){data-type="xref"});
or, keeping the pieces of a single button all neatly lined up
([Figure 11-4](#ch11.xhtml_fb_button-vert-centered){data-type="xref"}).
Flexbox makes what used to be challenging layout effects fairly simple.

The classic ["Holy Grail"
layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)), with a
header, three equal-height columns of varying flexibility, and a footer,
can be created in a few lines of CSS with either flexbox or grid layout,
which are covered in the next chapter. Here's an example of HTML that
might represent such a layout:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<header>Header</header>
<main>
  <nav>Links</nav>
  <aside>Aside content</aside>
  <article>Document content</article>
</main>
<footer>Footer</footer>
```

As the chapter progresses, remember that flexbox is designed for a
specific type of layout, that of single-dimensional content
distribution. It works best at arranging information along a single
dimension, or axis. While you can create grid-like layouts
(two-dimensional alignment) with flexbox, this is not its intended
purpose, and it has significant flaws for this use case. If you find
yourself pining for two-dimensional layout capabilities, see
[Chapter 12](../Text/ch12.xhtml#grid-layout){data-type="xref"}.

container*, also known as the *container box*. The element on which
`display: flex` or `display: inline-flex` is applied becomes the flex
container and generates a *flex formatting context* for its child nodes.

container, including several properties impacting the layout of flex

The `flex-direction` property specifies how flex items are placed in the
flex container. It defines the main-axis of a flex container, which is
the primary axis along which flex items are laid out (see
["Understanding Axes"](#ch11.xhtml_understanding-axis){data-type="xref"}
for more details).

Assume the following basic markup structure:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ol>
   <li>1</li>
   <li>2</li>
   <li>3</li>
   <li>4</li>
   <li>5</li>
</ol>
```

[Figure 11-5](#ch11.xhtml_four-values-flex-dir){data-type="xref"} shows
how that []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797054004288
primary="writing modes (flow direction)"
secondary="changing for languages" data-type="indexterm"}simple list
would be arranged by applying each of the four values of
`flex-direction`, assuming a left-to-right language.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_four-values-flex-dir" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1105.png" width="600" height="229"

</figure>

The default value, `row`, doesn't look all that different from a bunch
of inline or floated elements. This is misleading, for reasons you'll
soon see, but notice how the other `flex-direction` values affect the
arrangement of the list items.

For example, you can reverse this layout of the items with
`flex-direction: row-reverse`. The flex items are laid out from top to
bottom when `flex-direction: column` is set, and from bottom to top if
`flex-direction: column-reverse` is set, as shown in
[Figure 11-5](#ch11.xhtml_four-values-flex-dir){data-type="xref"}.

We specified left-to-right languages, because the direction of the
main-axis for `row`---the direction that the flex items are laid
out---is the direction of the current writing mode. We'll discuss how
writing modes affect flex direction and layout in a bit.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_921}

Do *not* use `flex-direction` to change the layout for right-to-left
languages. []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053992720
primary="dir attribute, HTML" data-type="indexterm"}Rather, use the
`dir` attribute in HTML, or the `writing-mode` CSS property described in
["Setting Writing
Modes"](../Text/ch15.xhtml#setting_writing_modes){data-type="xref"}, to
indicate the language direction. To learn more about language direction
and flexbox, see ["Working with Other Writing
Directions"](#ch11.xhtml_other-writing-directions){data-type="xref"}.
:::

The `column` value sets the flex container's main-axis to be the same
orientation as the block axis of the current writing mode. This is the
vertical axis in horizontal writing modes like English, and the
horizontal axis in vertical writing modes like traditional
[Japanese.]{.keep-together}

Thus, when declaring a `column` direction in English (or a language with
the same writing direction), the flex items are displayed in the same
order as declared in the source document, but from top to bottom instead
of left to right, so the flex items are laid out one on top of the next
instead of side by side. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  border-right: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

Thus, by simply writing a few CSS properties, we can create a nice
sidebar-style navigation for the list of links we saw earlier as a
horizontal row of tabs. For the new layout, we change the
`flex-direction` from the default value of `row` to `column` and move
the border from the bottom to the right;
[Figure 11-6](#ch11.xhtml_changing-flex-dir){data-type="xref"} shows the
result.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_changing-flex-dir" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1106.png" width="179" height="190"

class="play"><span class="play"><img

height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

The `column-reverse` value is similar to `column`, except the main-axis
is reversed; thus, `main-start` is placed at the *end* of the main-axis,
and `main-end` is placed at the *start* of the main-axis. In
top-to-bottom writing modes, that means the flex items are arranged
going upward, as shown previously in
[Figure 11-5](#ch11.xhtml_four-values-flex-dir){data-type="xref"}. The
`-reverse` values only change the appearance. The keyboard-navigation
tab order remains the same as the underlying markup.

What we've shown so far is super powerful and makes many layouts a
breeze. If we include the navigation within a full document, we can see
how simple layout can be with just a few flexbox property declarations.

Let's expand a little on our preceding HTML example, and include the
navigation as a component within a home page:

``` {.less_space .pagebreak-before code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My Page's title!</h1>
  </header>
  <nav>
    <a href="/">Home</a>
    <a href="/about">About</a>
    <a href="/blog">Blog</a>
    <a href="/jobs">Careers</a>
    <a href="/contact">Contact Us</a>
  </nav>
  <main>
     <article>
       <img alt="" src="img1.jpg">
       <p>This is some awesome content that is on the page.</p>
       <button>Go Somewhere</button>
     </article>
     <article>
       <img alt="" src="img2.jpg">
       <p>This is more content than the previous box, but less than
       the next.</p>
       <button>Click Me</button>
     </article>
     <article>
       <img alt="" src="img3.jpg">
       <p>We have lots of content here to show that content can grow, and
       everything can be the same size if you use flexbox.</p>
       <button>Do Something</button>
     </article>
  </main>
  <footer>Copyright &#169; 2023</footer>
</body>
```

By adding a few lines of CSS, we get a nicely laid-out home page
([Figure 11-7](#ch11.xhtml_using_flex_direction_row_and_column){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

  outline: 1px #ccc solid;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
}

}

  flex-direction: column;
}
```

Yes, elements can be flex items while also being flex containers, as you
can see with the navigation, main, and article elements in this case.
The `<body>` and `<article>` elements have `column` set as their flex
directions, and we let `<nav>` and `<main>` default to `row`. And all
that with just two lines of CSS!

To be clear, there's more styling at work in
[Figure 11-7](#ch11.xhtml_using_flex_direction_row_and_column){data-type="xref"}.
Borders, margins, and padding were applied to all the elements, so you
can visually differentiate the flex items for the sake of learning (we
wouldn't put this less-than-attractive site into production!).
Otherwise, all we've done is simply declare the body, navigation, main,
and articles as flex containers, making the navigation links, main,
article, images, paragraphs, and buttons [flex items.]{.keep-together}

default value `row` will do that. If you're writing in Arabic, or
another right-to-left (RTL) language, you likely want the flex items to
be laid out from right to left, and from top to bottom. The default
value `row` will do that, too.

Using `flex-direction: row` arranges the flex items in the same
direction as the text direction, also known as the *writing mode*,
whether the language is RTL or LTR. While most websites are presented in
left-to-right languages, some sites are in right-to-left languages, and
yet others are top-to-bottom. With flexbox, when you change the writing
mode, flexbox takes care of changing the flex direction for you.

The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053549904 primary="text-orientation property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053549184
primary="writing-mode property" data-type="indexterm"}writing mode is
set by the `writing-mode`, `direction`, and `text-orientation`
properties, or by the `dir` attribute in HTML. (These are covered in
[Chapter 15](../Text/ch15.xhtml#text_properties){data-type="xref"}.)
When the writing mode is right to left, the direction of the
main-axis---and therefore the flex items within the flex
container---will go from right to left when the `flex-direction` is
`row`. This is illustrated in
[Figure 11-8](#ch11.xhtml_four-vals-flex-dir){data-type="xref"}.

Vertically written languages include Bopomofo, Egyptian hieroglyphs,
Hiragana, Katakana, Han, Hangul, Meroitic cursive and hieroglyphs,
Mongolian, Ogham, Old Turkic, Phags Pa, Yi, and sometimes Japanese.
These languages are displayed vertically only when a vertical writing
mode is specified. If not, all of those languages are treated as
horizontal.

For top-to-bottom languages, `writing-mode: horizontal-tb` is in effect,
meaning the main-axis is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the default
left to right. Thus, `flex-direction: row` goes from top to bottom, and
`flex-direction: column` proceeds from right to left.
[Figure 11-9](#ch11.xhtml_writing_mode_horizontal_tb){data-type="xref"}
shows the effects of the various `flex-direction` values on the
following markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

    <li>一</li>
    <li>二</li>

That's right: the rows are vertical, and columns are horizontal. Not
only that, but the basic `column` direction is right to left, whereas
`column-reverse` runs left to right. That's what comes of applying these
values to a top-to-bottom, right-to-left language as we see here.

All right, you've seen various ways flex direction and writing modes
interact. But so far, all the examples have shown a single row or column
of flex items. What happens when the flex items' *main dimension* (their
combined inline sizes for `row` or combined block sizes for `column`)
don't fit within the flex container? We can either have them overflow
the container or can allow them to wrap onto additional flex lines.
Also, we'll later talk about how to allow flex items to shrink (or grow)
to fit the container.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053477440 primary=""

When the `flex-wrap` property is set to allow for multiple flex lines
via `wrap` or `wrap-reverse`, it determines where additional lines of
flex items appear: either before or after the original line of flex
items.

[Figure 11-10](#ch11.xhtml_three_values_of_flex_wrap){data-type="xref"}
demonstrates the three values of the `flex-wrap` property when the
`flex-direction` value is `row` (and the language is LTR). Where these
examples show two flex lines, the second line and subsequent flex lines
are added along the direction of the cross-axis (in this case, the
vertical axis).

<figure class="width-75">

When `wrap` is set, the cross-axis is the same as the block axis for
`flex-direction: row` and `row-reverse`, and is the same as the inline
axis of the language for `flex-direction: column` and `column-reverse`.

The difference is that when `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap-reverse`, the
cross-axis direction is reversed: subsequent flex lines are drawn above
the previous line in the case of `row` and `row-reverse`, and to the
left of the previous column in the case of `column-reverse` (assuming an
LTR language such as English).

We'll talk more about axes in just a moment, but first, let's talk about

The `flex-flow` shorthand property sets the `flex-direction` and
`flex-wrap` properties to define the flex container's wrapping and main-
and cross-axes.

As long as `display` is set to `flex` or `inline-flex`, omitting
`flex-flow`, `flex-direction`, and `flex-wrap` is the same as declaring
any of the following three, all of which have the result shown in
[Figure 11-11](#ch11.xhtml_flex_flow_row){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-flow: row;
flex-flow: nowrap;

In LTR writing modes, declaring any of the property values just listed,
or omitting the `flex-flow` property altogether, will create a flex
container with a horizontal main-axis that doesn't wrap.
[Figure 11-11](#ch11.xhtml_flex_flow_row){data-type="xref"} illustrates
flex items distributed along the horizontal axis, on one line,
overflowing a container that's 500 pixels wide.

If instead we want a reverse-column-oriented flow with wrapping, either
of these will [suffice:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-flow: column-reverse wrap;
flex-flow: wrap column-reverse;
```

In an LTR language like English, this causes the flex items to flow from
bottom to top, starting at the left side, and wrap to new columns in the
rightward direction. In a vertical writing mode like Japanese, which is
right-to-left when written vertically, the columns would be horizontal,
flowing from right to left, and wrap top to bottom.

We've been using terms like *main-axis* and *cross-axis* without really
delving into what they mean. It's time to clarify all that.

## Understanding Axes {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_934}

First: []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_cont_axes
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="flex containers"
tertiary="axes in" data-type="indexterm"}flex items are laid out along
the main-axis. Flex lines are added in the direction of the cross-axis.

Up until we introduced `flex-wrap`, all the examples had a single line
of flex items. In that single line, the flex items were laid out along
the main-axis, in the *main direction*, from main-start to main-end.
When we added flex wrapping, new flex lines were added along the
cross-axis, in the *cross direction*, going from cross-start to
cross-end.

As you can see, a lot of terms are used in that paragraph. Here are some
quick definitions:

Main-axis

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053315008 primary="main-axis, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}axis along which content flows. In flexbox,
    this is the direction in which flex items are flowed.

Main-size

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053312912 primary="main-size, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}total length of the content along the
    main-axis.

Main-start

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053310768 primary="main-start, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}end of the main-axis from which content begins
    to flow.

Main-end

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053308624 primary="main-end, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}end of the main-axis toward which content
    flows, opposite the main-start.

Cross-axis

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053306480 primary="cross-axis, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}axis along which flex lines are "stacked." In
    flexbox, this is the direction in which new lines of flex items are
    placed, if flex wrapping is permitted.

Cross-size

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053304336 primary="cross-size, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}total length of the content along the
    cross-axis.

Cross-start

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053302192 primary="cross-start, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}edge of the cross-axis where blocks begin to
    be stacked.

Cross-end

:   The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053300048 primary="cross-end, flexbox"
    data-type="indexterm"}opposite edge of the cross-axis from the
    cross-start.

While these terms may sound like logical properties such as
`margin-inline-start`, they are not the same thing. Here, the physical
direction of each changes depending on the value of the `flex-direction`
property. In fact, the meaning of each term in the context of layout
depends on the combination of the flex direction, the flex wrapping, and
the writing mode. Charting all the combinations for every writing mode
would get difficult, so let's examine what they mean for LTR languages.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_935}

It's important to understand that direction gets reversed when writing
direction is reversed. To make explaining (and understanding) flex
layout much simpler, the rest of the explanations and examples in this
chapter are based on an LTR writing mode, but will include how writing
mode impacts the flex properties and features
[discussed.]{.keep-together}

When []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_cont_direct_prop2
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="flex containers"
tertiary="flex-direction property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_direct_prop2
primary="flex-direction property" data-type="indexterm"}thinking about
`flex-direction`, we know that the flex items will start being laid out
along the main-axis of the flex container, starting from the main-start
edge and proceeding toward the main-end edge. If the `flex-wrap`
property is used to allow the container to wrap when the flex items
don't fit onto one line, the flex lines are laid out starting from the
cross-start edge and proceeding toward the cross-end edge.

As shown in
[Figure 11-12](#ch11.xhtml_flex_lines_on_row_and_row_reverse){data-type="xref"},
when we have horizontal rows of flex items, the cross-axis is vertical.
[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053290672

primary="flex-flow property" data-type="indexterm"}In these examples,
with `flex-flow: row wrap` and `flex-flow: row-reverse wrap` set on
horizontal languages, new flex lines are added below preceding flex
lines.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053286480 primary=""
startref="ix_flex_cont_axes" data-type="indexterm"} The cross-size is
the opposite of main-size, being height for `row` and `row-reverse` flex
directions, and width for `column` and `column-reverse` directions, in
both RTL and LTR[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053283616
primary="stacking of elements" data-type="indexterm"}
[languages.]{.keep-together}

By contrast, the `wrap-reverse` value inverts the direction of the
cross-axis. Normally for `flex-direction` of `row` and `row-reverse`,
the cross-axis goes from top to bottom, with the cross-start on top and
cross-end on the bottom. When `flex-wrap` is `wrap-reverse`, the
cross-start and cross-end directions are swapped, with the cross-start
on the bottom, cross-end on top, and the cross-axis going from bottom to
top. Additional flex lines get added on top of, or above, the previous
line.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053278992 primary=""

If the `flex-direction` is set to `column` or `column-reverse`, by
default the cross-axis goes from left to right in LTR languages, with
new flex lines being added to the right of previous
lines.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053273344 primary=""

with cross-start being on the right, cross-end being on the left, the
[cross-axis]{.keep-together} going from right to left, and additional
flex lines being added to the left of the previously drawn line.

# Arrangement of Flex Items {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_938}

In our []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_items_ch11
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="flex items"
data-type="indexterm"}examples thus far, we've skated past the precise
arrangement of the flex items within each flex line, and how that's
determined. It might seem intuitive that a row fills in horizontally,
but why should all the items huddle toward the main-start edge? Why not
have them grow to fill all available space, or distribute themselves
throughout the line?

For an example of what we're talking about here, check out
[Figure 11-14](#ch11.xhtml_empty-space-dir-main-cross){data-type="xref"}.
Notice the extra space at the top left. In this bottom-to-top,
right-to-left flow, new flex items get placed above the previous ones,
with new wrap lines being placed to the left of each previously filled
line.

By default, no matter the []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053259952
primary="flex-flow property" data-type="indexterm"}values of
`flex-flow`, empty space outside the flex items in a flex container will
be in the direction of main-end and cross-end, but CSS has properties
that allow us to alter that.

the main-end instead, centered, or even spaced out in various ways
across the main-axis.

The flex layout specification provides us with flex container properties
to control the distribution of space. The `justify-content` property
controls how flex items within a flex line are distributed along the
main-axis. []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053252560

property defines the default distribution of the flex items along the
cross-axis of each flex line; this global default can be individually
overridden with the flex item `align-self` property. When there is more
than one flex line and wrapping is enabled, the `align-content` property
defines how those flex lines are distributed along the cross-axis of the
flex container.

With `start` and `flex-start`, flex items are placed flush against
main-start. With `end` and `flex-end`, flex items are justified toward
main-end. The `center` option groups the items flush against each other,
centered in the middle of the main-axis. The `left` and `right` options
place items flush against the named sides of the box, regardless of the
actual axis direction.

The `space-between` value puts the first flex item on a flex line flush
with main-start and the last flex item in each flex line flush with
main-end, and then puts an equal amount of space between every pair of
adjacent flex items. The `space-evenly` value takes the leftover space
and splits it so that every gap is the same length. This means the
spaces at the start and end edges of the main-axis will be the same size
as the spaces placed between flex items.

By contrast, `space-around` splits up the leftover space and then
applies half of each portion to each flex item, as if there were
noncollapsing margins of equal size around each item. Note that this
means the space between any two flex items is twice that of the spaces
at the main-start and main-end of the flex line.

The `stretch` value has no effect as a value of `justify-content` in
flexbox. As you'll see in the next chapter, when placed on a grid
container, it causes grid items to grow in size until they take up all
available space in the main-axis direction.

### Justifying and overflow {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_946}

If []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_overflow_flex_cont
primary="overflowing flex container" data-type="indexterm"}flex items
are not allowed to wrap to multiple lines and overflow their flex line,
the value of `justify-content` influences the way the flex items will
overflow the flex [container.]{.keep-together}

Setting `justify-content: start` or `flex-start` explicitly sets the
default behavior of grouping the flex items toward main-start, placing
the first flex item of each flex line flush against the main-start side.
Each subsequent flex item then gets placed flush with the preceding flex
item's main-end side. (Remember, the location of the main-start side
depends on the flex direction and writing mode.) If there isn't enough
room for all the items and wrapping is not allowed, the items will
overflow the main-end edge. This is illustrated in
[Figure 11-16](#ch11.xhtml_justify_content_start){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_justify_content_start" class="figure">

height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

The mirror of this is setting `justify-content: end` or `flex-end`,
which puts the last flex on a line flush against the main-end with each
preceding flex item being placed flush with the subsequent item. In this
case, if the items aren't allowed to wrap, and if there isn't enough
room for all the items, the items will overflow on the main-start edge,
as illustrated in
[Figure 11-17](#ch11.xhtml_justify_content_end){data-type="xref"}.

Setting `justify-content: center` will pack all the items flush against
each other, and center them on the center of the flex line instead of
packing them against the main-start or main-end. If there isn't enough
room for all the items and they aren't allowed to wrap, the items will
overflow evenly on both the main-start and [main-end
edges.]{.keep-together}

illustrates these effects.

As the `left` and `right` values, they always start packing from the
left or right edge of a row, regardless of axis directions. Thus,
`justify-content: left` will always justify row-based content to the
left, whether the main-axis goes left to right or right to left. In
column-based content, `left` is treated the same as `start`, and `right`
the same as `end`. Any overflow will occur on the opposite side from
where the packing started; that is, flex items will overflow on the
right edge for `justify-content: left` and on the left edge for
`right`.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053175136 primary=""
startref="ix_overflow_flex_cont" data-type="indexterm"}

With those []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053174000 primary="spacing"
secondary="justifying content" data-type="indexterm"}relatively simple
cases covered, let's look at values that alter space between and around
flex items, and compare them to their wrapped cases. Note that if flex
items are allowed to wrap onto multiple lines, the space around each
flex item is based on the available space in their specific flex line
only, and will not (in most cases) be consistent from one line to the
next.

Setting `justify-content: space-between` puts the first flex item flush
with main-start and the last flex item on the line flush with main-end,
and then puts an equal amount of space around each flex item, until the
flex line is filled (see
[Figure 11-19](#ch11.xhtml_justify_content_space-between){data-type="xref"}).
If we have three flex items, the same amount of space will be between
the first and second items as between the second and third, but there
will be no extra empty space between the main-start and main-end edges
of the container and the first and last flex items in the line. This
means if a line has only one flex item, it will be flush with the
main-start edge, not centered. If there isn't enough space to fit all
the flex items and they aren't allowed to wrap, the items will overflow
on the main-end edge, yielding an effect visually indistinguishable from
`justify-content: start`.

Setting `justify-content: space-around` evenly distributes the extra
space on the line around each of the flex items, as if noncollapsing
margins of equal size were around each element on the main-dimension
sides
([Figure 11-20](#ch11.xhtml_justify_content_space-around){data-type="xref"}).
Thus, there will be twice as much space between the first and second
item as there is between main-start and the first item, and main-end and
the last item. If there isn't enough room for all the items and they
aren't allowed to wrap, the items will overflow evenly on both the
main-start and [main-end]{.keep-together} edges.

Setting `justify-content: space-evenly` means the user agent counts the
items, adds one, and then splits any extra space on the line by that
many (i.e., if we have five items, the amount of space is split into six
equal-size portions); see
[Figure 11-21](#ch11.xhtml_justify_content_space-evenly){data-type="xref"}.
One portion of the space is placed before each item on the line, as if
it were a noncollapsing margin, and the last portion is placed after the
last item on the list. Thus, the same amount of space will appear
between the first and second item as there is between main-start and the
first item, and main-end and the last item. If there isn't enough room
for all the items and they aren't allowed to wrap, the items will
overflow evenly on both the main-start and main-end edges.

The `stretch` value has no effect when set as the value of
`justify-content` on a flex container, and is treated the same as
`normal`. As you'll see in the next chapter, when placed on a grid
container, it causes the grid items to grow in size until they take up
all available space in the main-axis direction.

And finally, `justify-content: normal` is treated the same as
`justify-content: start`. This is the case for historical reasons too
boring and lengthy to get into here, but what it means is that the
default value of `justify-content` is essentially `start`, even if it is
technically `normal`.

Note in the previous few examples that when flex items are allowed to
wrap onto multiple lines, the space around each flex item is based on
the available space in its specific flex line only, and will not (in
many cases) be consistent from one line to the next.

::: {#ch11.xhtml_justify-content-example .sect3}
### justify-content example {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_953}

We took advantage of the default value of `justify-content` in
[Figure 11-2](#ch11.xhtml_simple_tabbed_navigation){data-type="xref"},
creating a left-aligned navigation bar. By changing the default value to
`justify-content: flex-end`, we can right-align the navigation bar in
English:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-start;
}
```

Note that `justify-content` is applied to the flex container. If we'd
applied to the links themselves, using something like
`nav a {justify-content: flex-start;}`, no alignment effect would have
occurred.

A major advantage of `justify-content` is that when the writing
direction changes (say, for RTL writing modes), we don't have to alter
the CSS to get the tabs where they need to go. The flex items are always
grouped toward main-start when `flex-start` is applied; in English,
main-start is on the left. For Hebrew, main-start is on the right. If
`flex-end` is applied and the `flex-direction` is `row`, then the tabs
go to the right side in English, and the left side in Hebrew, as shown
in
[Figure 11-22](#ch11.xhtml_right_and_left_aligned_navigation){data-type="xref"}.

This may seem like the main-start and main-end are similar to
inline-start and inline-end in logical properties. This will feel true
when `flex-direction` is set to `row`. With `flex-direction:`
`row-reverse`, however, the main-start and main-end get switched, but
the inline-start and inline-end don't, because the inline directions for
the flex items remain the same even if their flex order changes.

We could have centered that navigation, as shown in
[Figure 11-23](#ch11.xhtml_changing-layout-one-prop){data-type="xref"}:

All the flex items we've shown thus far are a single line tall, and
therefore are the same size in the cross dimension as their sibling flex
items. Before discussing wrapping flex lines, we need to discuss
aligning items of differing dimensions along the cross-axis, which is,
appropriately enough, called *aligning*.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797053067280

###### Note {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_958}

While `align-items` sets the alignment for all the flex items within a
container, the [`align-self`
property](#ch11.xhtml_the-align-self-property) enables overriding the
alignment for individual flex items, as you'll see in ["The align-self
property"](#ch11.xhtml_the-align-self-property){data-type="xref"}.
:::

In [Figure 11-24](#ch11.xhtml_vals-align-items){data-type="xref"}, note
how the flex items are arranged with respect to the cross-axis. (The
cross-axis is the block axis for row-flowed flex containers, and the
inline axis for column-flowed flex containers.)

<div id="ch11.xhtml_vals-align-items" class="figure">

height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

The default value, `normal`, is treated as `stretch` in flexbox.

For `stretch`, the cross-start edge of each flex item is placed against
the cross-start edge of the container, and the cross-end edges are also
placed against the cross-end edge of the container. This happens
regardless of the size of the content inside each flex item, so a flex
item with short content (such as "One") will still have its element box
fill out the cross-axis size of the flex container.

With the `center` value, by contrast, the element box is just as large
as it needs to be to contain the content along the cross-axis, and no
bigger. The cross-start and -end edges of the flex items are placed the
same distance away from the cross-start and -end edges of the container,
thus centering the flex item's box within the flex container along the
[cross-axis.]{.keep-together}

For the various `start` and `end` values, the cross-start or -end edges
of the flex items are all snugged up against the respective edge of the
flex container. There are so many ways to say `start` and `end`, mostly
for historical reasons that are too lengthy and painful to get into
here.

Notice that when the items are aligned to the start or end of the
cross-axis, their inline sizes are (by default) exactly as big as their
content needs to be, and no wider. It's as if their `max-width` was set
to `max-size`, so that extra content can wrap to multiple lines within
the flex item, but if no wrapping is needed, the element's inline size
won't fill out the entire flex container's inline size. This is a
default behavior of flex items, so if you want flex elements to fill out
the entire inline size of the flex container, the way block boxes fill
out their containing block, use the `stretch` value instead.

With `baseline`, the flex items' first baselines are aligned with one
another when they can do so, which is to say, when the `flex-direction`
is `row` or `row-reverse`. Because the font size of each flex item
differs, the baseline of each line in every flex item differs. The flex
item that has the greatest distance between its first baseline and its
cross-start side will be flush against the cross-start edge of the line.
The other flex items will be placed so that their first baselines line
up with the first baseline of the flex item that's flush against the
cross-start edge (and thus each other's first baselines). When
`align-items: last baseline;` is set, the inverse occurs. The flex item
with the greatest distance between its last baseline and the cross-end
side will be flush against the cross-end edge of the line. The other
flex items will be placed with their last baseline lined up with the
last baseline of the flex item that's flush against the cross-end edge,
unless overridden by `align-self` (see ["The align-self
property"](#ch11.xhtml_the-align-self-property){data-type="xref"}).
Since there isn't a way to align baselines in a columnar flow,
`baseline` is treated like `start` in these contexts, or `end` in the
case of `last baseline`.

### Flex item margins and alignment {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_960}

Now you have a []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_margin_flexbox primary="margins"
secondary="flexbox layout"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_margin
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="margins and"
data-type="indexterm"}general idea how each value behaves, but there's a
bit more to it than that. In the multiline `align-items` figures that
follow, the following styles have been applied:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  gap: 1em;
}
flex-item {border: 1px solid;}
.C, .H {margin-top: 1.5em;}
.D, .I {margin-bottom: 1em;}
.J {font-size: 3em;}
```

For each flex line, the cross-start and cross-end edges have been drawn
in as a red dotted and blue dashed line, respectively. The C, H, D, and
I boxes have added top or bottom margins. We've added a `gap` (which
will be discussed a bit later in the chapter) between the flex items to
make the figures more legible, which doesn't affect the impact of the
`align-items` property in this case. The J box has its font size
increased, which also increases its line height. (This will come into
play when we discuss the `baseline` value.)

The effects of these margins on both the `stretch` and `center`
alignments can be seen in
[Figure 11-25](#ch11.xhtml_margins-and-align){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>

</span>The effect of margins on cross-axis alignment</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The `stretch` value, as its name implies, stretches all "stretchable"
flex items to be as tall or wide as the tallest or widest flex item on
the line. A stretchable flex item is one that does not have a non-`auto`
value set for any of the sizing properties along the cross-axis. In
[Figure 11-25](#ch11.xhtml_margins-and-align){data-type="xref"}, that
would be the `block-size`, `min-block-size`, `max-block-size`, `height`,
`min-height`, and `max-height` properties. If all are set to `auto`, the
flex item is stretchable. If not, it is not.

Assuming a flex item is stretchable, its cross-start edge will be flush
with the flex line's cross-start edge, and its cross-end edge will be
flush with the flex line's cross-end edge. The flex item with the
largest cross-size will remain its default size, and the other flex
items will grow to the size of that largest flex item.

What [Figure 11-25](#ch11.xhtml_margins-and-align){data-type="xref"}
shows us is that it's the outer edge of the flex items' *margins* that
will be flush with cross-start and cross-end, not their border edges.
This is demonstrated by items C, D, H, and I, which appear smaller than
the other flex items on their flex lines. They're not, though. It's just
that their margins, which are always fully transparent, take up some of
the stretching space.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052959104 primary=""

cross-size is constrained, the contents may overflow the flex
container's cross-start and/or cross-end edge. The direction of the
overflow is not determined by the `align-items` property, but rather by
the `align-content` property, discussed in ["Aligning Flex
Lines"](#ch11.xhtml_the-align-content-property){data-type="xref"}. The
`align-items` property aligns the flex items within the flex line and
does not directly impact the overflow direction of the flex items within

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Baseline alignment" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch11.xhtml_align-items-baseline .sect3}
### Baseline alignment {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_963}

The `baseline` values[]{#ch11.xhtml_ix_baseline_flex_item
primary="baselines" secondary="flex item alignment"
data-type="indexterm"} are a little more complicated. CSS has two
possible baseline alignments, represented by `first baseline` and
`last baseline`. You can also use the value `baseline`, which is
equivalent to `first baseline`.

With `baseline` (and `first baseline`), the flex items in each line are
all aligned at the lowest first baseline. For each flex line, the flex
item with the biggest distance between its baseline and its cross-start
margin edge has that margin edge placed flush against the cross-start
edge of the line, and all other flex items' baselines are lined up with
the baseline of that flex item.

To understand this, take a look at the first set of flex items in
[Figure 11-26](#ch11.xhtml_align-items_baseline){data-type="xref"}, the
ones labeled `baseline` (and `first baseline`). For each flex line, the
cross-start and -end edges are marked with solid red and blue lines,
respectively. The baseline to which the items in each line are aligned
is marked with a dotted line, and the element whose baseline is taken as
the prime baseline has a lighter background and red text.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_align-items_baseline" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1126.png" width="600" height="312"

height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first line (A through E), it is the C box whose first baseline is
used. This is because the C box has a top margin, so its first baseline
is the farthest from the cross-start edge of the flex line. All the
other boxes (A, B, D, and E) have their first baselines aligned with the
first baseline of C.

In the second line (F through J), H's first baseline is used---again,
because of its top margin---and so the F, G, I, and J boxes have their
first baselines aligned with H's. Here, we can also see how the J box
has its first baseline aligned with all the others, despite its much
bigger font size.

Similar things happen for the flex items labeled with `last baseline`,
only here, the dominating factors are bottom margins. The D box in the
first line has a bottom margin, as does the I box in the second line. In
both cases, their last baselines are the farthest away from the
cross-end edge of the line, and so all the other flex items in their
rows have their last baselines aligned with the last baselines of D and
I. The dotted lines show the placements of the last baselines in each
flex line.

In many cases, `first baseline` will look like `start` (and its
equivalents, such as `flex-start`), and `last baseline` will look like
`end`. For example, had C lacked a top margin in
[Figure 11-26](#ch11.xhtml_align-items_baseline){data-type="xref"}, all
the items in that first line would have been visibly flush against the
top of the flex line, instead of pushed away from it. Anytime flex items
have different margins, borders, padding, font sizes, or line heights on
their cross-start side, the `start` and `first baseline` will differ.
Similarly, any cross-end margins, borders, etc. will create a difference
between the results of `last baseline` and `end`.

Any of the baseline values can become `start` when the baselines of the
flex items are parallel to the cross-axis. For example, suppose we take
the flex containers in
[Figure 11-26](#ch11.xhtml_align-items_baseline){data-type="xref"} and
change them to `flex-direction: column`. Now the cross-axis, like the
baselines of the English text within, is horizontal. Since there's no
way to create an offset from the cross-start edge of the columns that
will align the text baselines, `baseline` is treated exactly as if it
were `start` instead; or `end`, in the case of last
baseline.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052874864 primary=""

### Safe and unsafe alignment {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_965}

In all the []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052872112
primary="safe and unsafe flex item alignment"
data-type="indexterm"}previous examples, we let the flex containers be
whatever size they needed to be to contain the flex lines; that is, we
left them at `block-size: auto` (or `height: auto`, in old-school CSS
terminology). But what happens if the block size of a flex container is
constrained in some way, perhaps by the size of a grid track or an
explicit block size value being given? In these situations, the `safe`
and `unsafe` keywords come into play.

If `safe` alignment is specified, then anytime a flex item would
overflow the flex container, the flex item is treated as though its
`align-self` were set to `start`. That would look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-container {display: flex; height: 10em;
     align-items: safe first baseline;}
```

On the other hand, if `unsafe` is used, the alignment of flex items is
honored no matter what that means in terms of overflowing the flex
container.

If you're wondering which is the default, the answer is neither.
Instead, when neither safe nor unsafe alignment has been declared,
browsers should default to `unsafe` behavior *unless* this would cause
flex items to overflow the scrollable area of their nearest ancestor's
scroll container, in which case they should align to the cross-axis edge
farthest away from the edge they would otherwise overflow.

items, but not all, you can include the `align-self` property on the
flex items you would like to align differently. This property takes the
same values as `align-items` and is used to override the `align-items`
property value on a per-flex-item basis.

You can override the cross-axis alignment of any individual flex item
with the `align-self` property, as long as it's represented by an
element or pseudo-element. You cannot []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052793328
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="flex items"
tertiary="anonymous"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052792112
primary="anonymous items" secondary="flex items"
data-type="indexterm"}override the alignment for anonymous flex items
(non-empty text node children of flex containers). Their `align-self`
always matches the value of `align-items` of their parent flex
container.

The default value of `align-items` is `stretch`, but let's make that
explicit in the following code, which will let us set different
`align-self` values for the second flex item, as illustrated in
[Figure 11-28](#ch11.xhtml_align_self_fig){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.flex-container {align-items: stretch;}
.flex-container .two {align-self: var(--selfAlign);}
```

All these flex items have `align-self`'s default value of `auto`,
meaning they inherit the alignment (in this case, `stretch`) from the
container's `align-items` [property]{.keep-together}. The exception in
each example is the second flex item, which has been given the
`align-self` value shown underneath.

As we said, all the values of `align-items` can be used for
`align-self`, including the values for first and last baseline
alignment, `safe` and `unsafe` alignment, and so on.

## Aligning Flex Lines {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_971}

In nearly all the previous examples, the flex container's cross-size was
always as tall as it needed to be: no `block-size` or `height` was
declared on the container, so it defaulted to `height: auto`. Because of
this, the flex container grew to fit the content.

Had the cross-size of the container been set to a specific size, there
may have been extra space at the cross-end, or not enough space to fit
the content. []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_align_content_prop
primary="align-content property" data-type="indexterm"}In such cases,
CSS allows us to control the overall placement of flex lines with the
`align-content` property.

```
The `align-content` []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052710512 primary="spacing"
secondary="aligning content" data-type="indexterm"}property dictates how
any extra cross-direction space in a flex container is distributed
between and around flex lines. Although the values and concepts are
largely the same, `align-content` is different from the previously
discussed `align-items` property, which dictates flex item positioning
within each flex line.

Think of `align-content` as similar to the way `justify-content` aligns
individual items along the main-axis of the flex container, but it does
so for flex lines with regard to the cross-axis of the container. This
property applies to multiline flex containers, having no effect on
nonwrapping and otherwise single-line flex containers.

Consider the following CSS as a base and assume the flex items have no
margins:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  align-items: flex-start;
  border: 1px dashed;
  height: 14em;
  background-image: url(banded.svg);
}
```

[Figure 11-29](#ch11.xhtml_distribution_of_extra_space){data-type="xref"}
demonstrates the possible values of the `align-content` property, as
used in conjunction with that CSS. We've concentrated on the primary
alignment values, and left out examples of things such as safe and
unsafe alignment as well as the first and last baseline alignments.

With a height of 14 ems, the flex container is taller than the default
combined heights of the three flex lines. Given the larger text of some
flex items and the various bits of padding and borders, each flex
container in
[Figure 11-29](#ch11.xhtml_distribution_of_extra_space){data-type="xref"}
has approximately 3 ems of [leftover space.]{.keep-together}

<figure>

class="play"><span class="play"><img
src="./images/play-icon-round.png" width="100"
height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

With the values `normal`, `stretch`, `center`, `start`, `flex-start`,
`end`, and `flex-end`, the free space is distributed outside the flex
lines, as illustrated in
[Figure 11-29](#ch11.xhtml_distribution_of_extra_space){data-type="xref"}.
These act in the same ways as they do for `align-items`.
[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052666048 primary="stretching"
secondary="aligning content" data-type="indexterm"}With the value
`stretch`, the extra space is evenly distributed to all the flex lines,
increasing their cross-size until their edges touch. For the others, the
flex lines are kept together, with the leftover space placed to one side
or another.

For the remaining values, the flex lines are pushed apart and the
leftover space distributed in various ways. Let's assume the
approximately 3 ems of leftover space is equal to 120 pixels. (It's big
text, OK?)

Given `space-between`, about 60 pixels of space is between each adjacent
pair of flex lines, each half of the leftover 120 pixels. With
`space-around`, the space is evenly distributed around each line: the
120 pixels are split into three pieces, since there are three flex
lines. This puts 20 pixels of noncollapsed space (half of 40 pixels) on
the cross-start and cross-end sides of each flex line, so we have 20
pixels of extra space at the cross-start and cross-end sides of the flex
container, and 40 pixels of space between adjacent flex lines.

For `space-evenly`, there are four spaces to insert: one before each
flex line, and an extra space after the last flex line. With three
lines, that means four spaces, with 30 pixels for each space. That
places 30 pixels of space at the cross-start and cross-end sides of the
flex container, and 30 pixels between adjacent flex lines.

Continuing this example for the stretch value, you'll note that the
`stretch` value is different: with `stretch`, the lines stretch with the
extra space evenly distributed among the flex lines rather than between
them. In this case, 40 pixels are added to each of the flex lines,
causing all three lines to grow in height by an equal amount---that is,
the extra space is divided equally, not proportionally, with the exact
same amount added to each.

If there isn't enough room for all the lines, they will overflow at
cross-start, cross-end, or both, depending on the value of the
`align-content` property. This is shown in
[Figure 11-30](#ch11.xhtml_align_content_overflowing){data-type="xref"},
where the dotted box with a light-gray background represents a short
flex container. (A little bit of inline padding was added to each flex
container to make it more obvious where it starts and ends.)

</span>Flex-line overflow directions for each value of
<code>align-content</code></h6>
</div>
</figure>

The only difference in the CSS between this and
[Figure 11-29](#ch11.xhtml_distribution_of_extra_space){data-type="xref"}
is the height of the flex container. Here, the flex containers have been
reduced to a height of 7 ems, so as to create flex containers not tall
enough to encompass all their flex lines (which, as you may recall,
total around 10 ems in height).

When the flex lines []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052624176
primary="overflowing flex container" data-type="indexterm"}overflow the
flex container, the `align-content` values `normal`, `stretch`, `start`,
`flex-start`, `baseline`, `last baseline`, and `space-between` cause
them to overflow on the cross-end side, whereas the values `center`,
`space-around`, and `space-evenly` evenly overflow both the cross-end
and cross-start sides. Only `align-content:` `end` and `flex-end` cause
flex lines to overflow on just the cross-start side.

Keep in mind that these values are not top- or bottom-centric. If the
cross-axis goes upward, `align-content: flex-start` will start aligning
flex lines from the bottom and work upward from there, potentially
overflowing the top (cross-end) edge. For that matter, when the flow
direction is columnar, the cross-axis will be horizontal, in which case
the cross-start and -end edges will be the right or left edges of the
flex container.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052616528 primary=""

You can supply either one or two values. If you supply one,
`place-content` acts as if you had set both `align-content` and
`justify-content` to the same value. In other words, the following two
rules are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {place-content: center;}
.gallery {align-content: center; justify-content: center;}
```

The exception to this behavior occurs if the value is baseline-related,
such as `first baseline`. In that case, the value for `justify-content`
is set to `start`, making the following two rules equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {place-content: last baseline;}
.gallery {align-content: last baseline; justify-content: start;}
```

If two values are given, the second is the value of `justify-content`.
Thus, the following two rules are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {place-content: last baseline end;}
.gallery {align-content: last baseline; justify-content: end;}
```

That's pretty much all there is to `place-content`. If you'd rather
align and justify content by using a single shorthand property,
`place-content` does that. Otherwise, use the individual properties
separately.

Two more `place-` shorthand properties are covered in

Each of these []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052422496 primary="gutter space"
secondary="between flex items" data-type="indexterm"}properties inserts
space of the declared size between adjacent flex items. This space is
often referred to as a *gutter*. For historical reasons, the default
value, `normal`, equates to 0 pixels (no space) in flexbox and grid
containers, and `1` em in multicolumn layout. Otherwise, you can supply
a single length or percentage value.

Suppose we have a set of flex items that will wrap to multiple flex
lines, and we want to open a 15-pixel gap between the flex lines. Here's
what that CSS would look like, illustrated in
[Figure 11-31](#ch11.xhtml_row-gaps){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

</figure>

No []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052395184
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="margins and"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052394208 primary="margins"
secondary="flexbox layout" data-type="indexterm"}margins are set on the
flex items, to be clear. Exactly 15 pixels of space is between each flex
line (row), thanks to the value of `row-gap`. In essence, `row-gap` acts
as if it were called `block-axis-gap`, so if the writing mode were
changed to something like `vertical-rl`, thus making the block axis
horizontal, the rows would flow top to bottom, and the gaps between them
would be to their right and left sides (which are their block-start and
block-end sides).

Note that there are gaps only between rows: there are no gaps placed
between the flex items and the block-start and -end edges of the flex
container. If you want to open gaps of the same size along those
container edges, you would write something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; row-gap: 15px; padding-block: 15px;}
```

In a like manner, we can open spaces between the flex items along the
inline axis by using `column-gap`. We can modify the earlier example to
push items apart as follows, with the result shown in
[Figure 11-32](#ch11.xhtml_column-gaps){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; column-gap: 15px;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_column-gaps" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_980"><span class="label">Figure 11-32.
</span>Gaps between adjacent flex items along the inline axis</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Here, leftover space remains at the inline-end side of the flex lines,
with each line having its own amount of space. That's because the flex
items weren't given a `justify-content` value, so they defaulted to
`start`. This means the gaps between the flex items are all exactly 15
pixels wide.

If we were to change the value of `justify-content` to `space-between`,
then in any flex line with leftover space, the gaps between flex items
will be increased by an equal amount, meaning they will be separated by
more than 15 pixels. If there's a line where the inline sizes of all the
flex items and all the gaps exactly equals the inline length of the flex
line, 15 pixels of space will be between each flex item.

This is why `row-gap` and `column-gap` are really more like minimum
separation distances between flex items or flex lines. The gaps don't
count as "leftover space," any more than the flex items do.

Gaps are inserted between the outer margin edges of adjacent flex items,
so if you add margins to your flex items, the actual visible space
between two flex items will be the width of the gap plus the widths of
the margins. Consider the following, which is illustrated in
[Figure 11-33](#ch11.xhtml_column-gaps-plus-margins){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; column-gap: 15px;}
.gallery div {margin-inline: 10px;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_column-gaps-plus-margins" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1133.png" width="600" height="186" />
<h6 id="ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_981"><span class="label">Figure 11-33.
</span>Gaps and margins combine to open more space</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now the open spaces between flex items are all 35 pixels wide: 15 pixels
from the `gap` property, plus 20 pixels (10 + 10) from the inline-side
margins set on the flex items.

Thus far we've used length values, but what about percentages? Any
percentage value used for a gap is taken to be a percentage of the
container's size along the relevant axis. Thus, given `column-gap: 10%`,
the gaps will be 10% the inline size of the flex container. If the
container is 640 pixels wide along the inline axis, the column gaps will
be 64 pixels each.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052243920 primary=""
startref="ix_col_gap_prop" data-type="indexterm"}

Working with rows can be a little more complicated. If you define an
explicit block size, percentages are just a percentage of that block
size. A `block-size` (which could also be set with `height` or `width`)
of `25em` and a `row-gap` of `10%` means row gaps will be 2.5 ems wide.
This same sort of thing can also happen if the block size happens to be
larger than the sum total of the rows' block sizes.

But when the []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052238944
primary="cyclic calculation" data-type="indexterm"}block size is solely
determined by the block sizes of the rows added together, any percentage
value could lead to a *cyclic calculation*: each calculation changes the
value being calculated, ad infinitum. Suppose a flex container has three
flex lines, each exactly 30 pixels tall. The flex container is set so
its height is `auto`, so it will "shrink-wrap" the flex lines, making it
90 pixels tall (we're assuming no padding here, but the principles are
the same regardless). A `row-gap` of `10%` would mean 9-pixel row gaps,
and inserting the 2 row gaps would add 18 pixels of height. That would
increase the container's height to 108 pixels, which would mean the
10%-wide gaps are now 10.8 pixels, so the container height increases
again, which increases the row gaps, which increases container height,
which...

To avoid this sort of infinite-loop scenario, the gaps are set to be
zero-width whenever a cyclic calculation would happen, and everyone
moves on with their lives. In practice, this means that percentage
values for row gaps are useful only in a narrow range of cases, whereas
they can be more broadly useful for column gaps.

You can set up both []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_gap_prop primary="gap property"

supplying the two properties individually, or you can use the shorthand

You need to supply only one value to `gap`, in which case it will be

###### Note {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_985}

The original `gap` property was defined in CSS Multiple Columns, with
additional hyphenated gap properties defined in CSS Grid as
`grid-row-gap`, `grid-column-gap`, and `grid-gap`, before being made
more generic and available in grid, flexbox, and multicolumn contexts.
Browsers are required to treat the older properties as aliases for the
newer, more generic properties; e.g., `grid-gap` is an alias for `gap`.
So if you find the older grid gap properties in legacy CSS, you can
change them to the newer names, but if not, they'll still work as if you
had.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052158960 primary=""

The flexible box layout specification provides several additional

flex-item-specific properties, we can more precisely control the layout
of individual flex containers' children.

As you've []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797052148272 primary="display property"
secondary="flex items" data-type="indexterm"}seen throughout the
chapter, we create flex containers by adding `display: flex` or
`display: inline-flex` to an element that has child nodes. The children
of those flex containers are called *flex items*---whether they're child
elements, non-empty text nodes between child elements, or generated
content. In
[Figure 11-36](#ch11.xhtml_display_flex_containers_children){data-type="xref"},
each letter is enclosed in its own element, including the space between
words, so that each letter and space becomes a flex item.

primary="anonymous items" secondary="flex items"
data-type="indexterm"}comes to text-node children of flex containers, if
the text node is not empty (containing content other than whitespace),
it will be wrapped in an *anonymous flex item*, behaving like its
flex-item siblings. While these anonymous flex items do inherit all the
flex properties set by the flex container, just like their DOM node
siblings, they are not directly targetable with CSS. We can't directly
set any of the flex-item-specific properties on them. Thus, in the
following markup, the two elements (`<strong>` and `<em>`) and the text
"they're what's for" become flex items, for a total of three flex items:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="display: flex;">
    <strong>Flex items:</strong> they’re what’s for <em>&lt;br&gt;fast!</em>
</p>
```

Generated content (via `::before` and `::after`) can be styled directly;
therefore, all the properties discussed in this chapter apply equally to
generated content and to element nodes.

nodes within a flex container are ignored, as if their `display`
property were set to `none`, as the following code example shows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav ul {
  display: flex;
}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

In the preceding code, with the `display` property set to `flex`, the
unordered list is the flex container, and its child list items are all
flex items. These list items, being flex items, are flex-level
boxes---semantically still list items, but not list items in their
presentation. They are not block-level boxes either. Rather, they
participate in their container's flex-formatting context. The whitespace
between and around the `<li>` elements---the line feeds and indenting
tabs and/or spaces---is completely ignored. The links are not flex items
themselves, but are descendants of the flex items the list items have
become.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051979792 primary=""

primary="float property" data-type="indexterm"}margins of flex items do
not collapse. The `float` and `clear` properties don't have an effect on
flex items and do not take a flex item out of flow. In effect, `float`
and `clear` are ignored when applied to flex items. (However, the
`float` property can still affect box generation by influencing the
`display` property's computed value.) Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
aside {
  display: flex;
}
img {
  float: left;
}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<aside>
    <!-- this is a comment -->
    <h1>Header</h1>

    <img src="images/foo.jpg" alt="Foo Master">
    Some text
</aside>
```

In this example, the `aside` is the flex container. The comment and
whitespace-only text nodes are ignored. The text node containing "Some
text" is wrapped in an anonymous flex item. The header, image, and text
node containing "Some text" are all flex items. Because the image is a
flex item, the `float` is ignored.

Even though []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051861408 primary="blocks"
secondary="blockification of flex items" data-type="indexterm"}images
and text nodes are inline-level nodes, because they are flex items, they
are blockified as long as they are not absolutely positioned:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
aside {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
aside * {
  border: 1px solid;

    <img src="images/foo.jpg" alt="foo master">
    Some text <a href="foo.xhtml">with a link</a> and more text
</aside>
```

This markup is similar to the previous code example, except in this
example we've added a link within the non-empty text node. In this case,
we are creating five flex items illustrated in
[Figure 11-37](#ch11.xhtml_display_flex_five_items){data-type="xref"}.
The comment and whitespace-only text nodes are ignored. The header, the
image, the text node before the link, the link, and the text node after
the link are all flex items.

positioned children of flex containers, just like any other absolutely
positioned element, are taken out of the flow of the document.

More to the point, they do not participate in flex layout and are not
part of the document flow. However, they can be impacted by the styles
set on the flex container, just as a child can be impacted by a parent
element that isn't a flex container. In addition to inheriting any
inheritable properties, the flex container's properties can affect the
origin of the positioning.

The absolutely positioned child of a flex container is affected by both
the `justify-content` value of the flex container and its own
`align-self` value, if there is one. For example, if you set
`align-self: center` on the absolutely positioned child, it will start
out centered with respect to the flex container parent's cross-axis.
From there, the element or pseudo-element can be moved by properties
like `top`, `bottom`, margins, and so on.

container. This is because when it comes to flex items, the implied
value of `min-width` is `auto`, rather than `0`. Originally in the
specification, if the items didn't fit onto that single main-axis, they
would shrink. However, the specification of `min-width` was altered as
applied to flex items. (Traditionally, the default value for
[`min-width`]{.keep-together} is `0`.)

If you set `min-width` to a width narrower than the computed value of
`auto`---for example, if you declare `min-width: 0`---the flex items in
the `nowrap` example will shrink to be narrower than their actual
content (in some cases). If the items are allowed to wrap, they will be
as narrow as possible to fit their content, but no narrower.

tertiary="individually applied properties" data-type="indexterm"}flex
items' alignment, order, and flexibility are to some extent controllable
via properties set on their flex container, several properties can be
applied to individual flex items for more granular control.

The `flex` shorthand []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_prop primary="flex property"
data-type="indexterm"}property, along with its component properties of
`flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`, controls the flexibility
of the flex items. *Flexibility* is the amount by which a flex item can
grow or shrink along the main-axis.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051678000
primary="" startref="ix_flex_items_min_width"

## The flex Property {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_996}

The defining aspect of flex layout is the ability to make the flex items
*flex*: altering their width or height to fill the available space in
the main dimension. A flex container distributes free space to its items
proportionally to their flex grow factor, or shrinks them to prevent
overflow proportionally to their flex shrink factor. (We'll explore
these concepts momentarily.)

Declaring the `flex` shorthand property on a flex item, or defining the
individual properties that make up the shorthand, enables you to define
the grow and shrink factors. If there is excess space, you can tell the
flex items to grow to fill that space. Or not. If there isn't enough
room to fit all the flex items within the flex container at their
defined or default sizes, you can tell the flex items to shrink
proportionally to fit into the space. Or not.

This is all done with the `flex` property, which is a shorthand property
for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. While these three
subproperties can be used separately, it is highly recommended to always
use the `flex` shorthand, for reasons we'll soon cover.

The `flex` property specifies the components of a flexible length: the
*length* of the flex item being the length of the flex item along the
main-axis (see ["Understanding
Axes"](#ch11.xhtml_understanding-axis){data-type="xref"}). When a box is
a flex item, `flex` is consulted to determine the size of the box,
instead of the main-axis size dimension property (`height` or `width`).
The *components* of the `flex` property include the flex growth factor,
flex shrink factor, and the flex basis.

The *flex basis* determines[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051647824
primary="flex-basis property" data-type="indexterm"} how the flex growth
and shrink factors are implemented. As its name suggests, the
`flex-basis` component of the flex shorthand is the basis on which the
flex item determines how much it can grow to fill available space or how
much it should shrink to fit all the flex items when there isn't enough
space. It's the initial size of each flex item, and can be restricted to
that specific size by specifying `0` for both the growth and shrink
factors:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.flexItem {
    width: 50%;
    flex: 0 0 200px;
}
```

In the preceding CSS, the flex item will have a main-axis size of
exactly 200 pixels, as the flex basis is `200px`, and it is allowed to
neither grow nor shrink. Assuming that the main-axis is horizontal, the
value of `width` (`50%`) is ignored. Similarly, a value for `height`
would be ignored if the main-axis were vertical.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_998}

This override of `height` and `width` occurs outside the cascade, so you
can't even override the flex basis by adding `!important` to the
`height` or `width` value of a flex item.

The value of `flex-grow` is always a number. Negative numbers are not
valid. You can use non-integers if you like, just as long as they're 0
or greater. The value sets the *flex growth factor*, which determines
how much the flex-item will grow relative to the rest of the flex item
siblings as the flex container's free space is distributed.

If any space is available within the flex container, the space will be
distributed proportionally among the children with a nonzero positive
growth factor based on the various values of those growth factors.

For example, assume a `750px`-wide horizontal flex container with three
flex items, each set to `width: 100px`. A total of 300 pixels of space
is taken up by the flex items, leaving 450 pixels of "leftover" or
available space (since 750 -- 300 = 450). This is the first scenario
shown in
[Figure 11-40](#ch11.xhtml_variety_of_growth_factor_scenarios){data-type="xref"}:
none of the flex items are permitted to grow.

height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the second scenario in
[Figure 11-40](#ch11.xhtml_variety_of_growth_factor_scenarios){data-type="xref"},
only one of the flex items (the third) has been given a growth factor.
The declaration we gave it is `flex-grow: 1`, but it could be any
positive number the browser can understand. In this case, with two items
having no growth factor and the third having a growth factor, all of the
available space is given to the flex item with a growth factor. Thus,
the third flex item gets all 450 pixels of available space added to it,
arriving at a final width of 550 pixels. The `width: 100px` applied to
it elsewhere in the styles is overridden.

In the third and fourth scenarios, the same flex item widths result
despite the differing flex growth factors. Let's consider the third
scenario, where the growth factors are 1, 1, and 3. The factors are all
added together to get a total of 5. Each factor is then divided by that
total to get a proportion. So here, the three values are each divided by
5, yielding 0.2, 0.2, and 0.6.

Each proportion is multiplied by the available space to get the amount
of growth. Thus:

1.  450 px × 0.2 = 90 px

2.  450 px × 0.2 = 90 px

3.  450 px × 0.6 = 270 px

Those are the growth portions added to each flex item's starting width
of 100 pixels. Thus, the final widths are 190 pixels, 190 pixels, and
370 pixels, respectively.

The fourth scenario has the same result, because the proportions are the
same. Imagine for a moment that we alter the growth factors to be 0.5,
1, and 1.5. Now the math works out such that the first flex item gets
one-sixth of the available space, the second gets a third, and the third
gets half. This results in the flex items' final widths being 175, 250,
and 425 pixels, respectively. Had we declared growth factors of 0.1,
0.1, and 0.3, or 25, 25, and 75, or really any combination of numbers
with a 1:1:3 correspondence, the result would have been identical.

As noted in ["Minimum Widths"](#ch11.xhtml_min-width){data-type="xref"},
if no width or flex basis is set, the flex basis defaults to `auto`,
meaning each flex item basis is the width of its nonwrapped content. The
`auto` value is special: []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051561808
primary="content keywords" data-type="indexterm"}it defaults to
`content` unless the item has a width set on it, at which point the flex
basis becomes that width. The `auto` value is discussed in ["Automatic
flex basis"](#ch11.xhtml_auto){data-type="xref"}. Had we not set the
width in this example scenario, with our smallish font size, we would
have had more than 450 pixels of distributable space along the
main-axis.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1003}

The main-axis size of a flex item is impacted by the available space,
the growth factor of all the flex items, and the flex basis of the item.
We have yet to cover [flex basis](#ch11.xhtml_flex-basis), but that time
is coming soon!
:::

Now let's consider flex items with different `width` values as well as
different growth factors. In
[Figure 11-41](#ch11.xhtml_even-dist-avail-space){data-type="xref"}, in
the second example, we have flex items that are 100 pixels, 250 pixels,
and 100 pixels wide, with growth factors of 1, 1, and 3, respectively,
in a container that is 750 pixels wide. This means we have 300 pixels of
extra space to distribute among a total of five growth factors (since
750 -- 450 = 300). Each growth factor is therefore 60 pixels (300 ÷ 5).
Therefore, the first and second flex items, with a `flex-grow` value of
`1`, will each grow by 60 pixels. The last flex item will grow by 180
pixels, since its `flex-grow` value is `3`.

</figure>

To recap, the available space in the flex container, the growth factors,
and final width of each flex item are as follows:

-   Available space: 750 px -- (100 px + 250 px + 100 px) = 300 px
-   Growth factors: 1 + 1 + 3 = 5
-   Width of each growth factor: 300 px ÷ 5 = 60 px

When flexed, the width of the flex items, based on their original width
and growth factors, become

-   item1 = 100 px + (1 × 60 px) = 160 px
-   item2 = 250 px + (1 × 60 px) = 310 px
-   item3 = 100 px + (3 × 60 px) = 280 px

which adds up to 750 pixels.

::: {#ch11.xhtml_growth-factors-and-the-flex-property .sect2}
## Growth Factors and the flex Property {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1005}

The `flex` property[]{#ch11.xhtml_ix_grow_factor
primary="growth factor, flex box layout" data-type="indexterm"} takes up
to three values---the growth factor, shrink factor, and basis. The first
positive non-null numeric value, if there is one, sets the growth factor
(i.e., the `flex-grow` value). When the growth and shrink factors are
omitted in the `flex` value, the growth factor defaults to `1`. However,
if neither `flex` nor `flex-grow` is declared, the growth factor
defaults to `0`. Yes, really.

Recall the second example in
[Figure 11-40](#ch11.xhtml_variety_of_growth_factor_scenarios){data-type="xref"},
where the flex growth factors were 0, 0, and 1. Because we declared a
value for `flex-grow` only, the []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_basis_prop
primary="flex-basis property" secondary="growth factors and"
data-type="indexterm"}flex basis was set to `auto`, as if we had
declared the following:

``` {.pagebreak-before code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example2 flex-item {
  flex: 0 1 auto;
}
#example2 flex-item:last-child {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}
```

[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051511552
primary="shrink factor, for flexbox layout" data-type="indexterm"}So
that means the first two flex items had no growth factor, a shrink
factor, and a flex basis of `auto`. Had we used `flex` in the examples
in
[Figure 11-40](#ch11.xhtml_variety_of_growth_factor_scenarios){data-type="xref"}
instead of ill-advisedly using `flex-grow`, the flex basis in each case
would be set to `0%`, as if this had been done:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example2 flex-item {
  flex: 0 1 0%;
}
#example2 flex-item:last-child {
  flex: 1 1 0%;
}
```

As the shrink factor defaults to `1` and the basis defaults to `0%`, the
following CSS is identical to the preceding snippet:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example2 flex-item {
  flex: 0;
}
#example2 flex-item:last-child {
  flex: 1;
}
```

This would have the result shown in
[Figure 11-42](#ch11.xhtml_flex_basis_is_0){data-type="xref"}. Compare
this to
[Figure 11-40](#ch11.xhtml_variety_of_growth_factor_scenarios){data-type="xref"}
to see how things have changed (or not).

You may notice something odd in the first two scenarios: the flex basis
been set to 0, and only the last flex item in the second scenario has a
positive value for flex growth. Logic would seem to dictate that the
widths of the three flex items should be 0, 0, and 750 pixels,
respectively. But logic would also dictate that it makes no sense to
have content overflowing its flex item if the flex container has the
room for all the content, even if the basis is set to `0`.

The specification authors thought of this quandary. When the `flex`
property declaration explicitly sets or defaults the flex basis to `0%`
and a flex item's growth factor is `0`, the length of the main-axis of
the nongrowing flex items will shrink to the smallest length the content
allows, or smaller. In
[Figure 11-42](#ch11.xhtml_flex_basis_is_0){data-type="xref"}, that
minimum length is the width of the widest sequence of letters, "flex:"
(including the colon).

As long as a flex item has a visible overflow and no explicitly set
value for `min-width` (or `min-height` for vertical main-axes), the
minimum width (or minimum height) will be the smallest width (or height)
that the flex item needs to be to fit the content or the declared
`width` (or `height`), whichever is smaller.

</div>
</figure>

If all items are allowed to grow, and the flex basis for each flex item
is `0%`, *all* of the space, rather than just excess space, is
distributed proportionally based on the growth factors. In the third
example in
[Figure 11-42](#ch11.xhtml_flex_basis_is_0){data-type="xref"}, two flex
items have growth factors of 1, and one flex item has a growth factor of
3. We thus have a total of five growth factors:

-   (2 × 1) + (1 × 3) = 5

With five growth factors, and a total of 750 pixels, each growth factor
is worth 150 [pixels:]{.keep-together}

-   750 px ÷ 5 = 150 px

While the default flex item size is 100 pixels, the flex basis of `0%`
overrides that, leaving us with two flex items at 150 pixels each and
the last flex item with a width of 450 pixels:

-   1 × 150 px = 150 px
-   3 × 150 px = 450 px

Similarly, in the last example of
[Figure 11-42](#ch11.xhtml_flex_basis_is_0){data-type="xref"}, with two
flex items having growth factors of 0.5, and one flex item having a
growth factor of 1.5, we have a total of 2.5 growth factors:

-   (2 × 0.5) + (1 × 1.5) = 2.5

With a 2.5 growth factor, and a total of 750 pixels, each growth factor
is worth 300 [pixels:]{.keep-together}

-   750 px ÷ 2.5 = 300 px

While the default flex item size is 100 pixels, the flex basis of 0%
overrides that, leaving us with two flex items at 150 pixels each and
the last flex item with a width of 450 pixels:

-   0.5 × 300 px = 150 px
-   1.5 × 300 px = 450 px

Again, this is different from declaring only `flex-grow`, because that
means the flex basis defaults to `auto`. In that case, only the extra
space, not all the space, is distributed proportionally. When using
`flex`, on the other hand, the flex basis is set to `0%`, so the flex
items grow in proportion to the total space, not just the leftover
space. [Figure 11-43](#ch11.xhtml_flex-grow-basis-0){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the difference.

The shrink factor determines how much a flex item will shrink relative
to the rest of its flex-item siblings when there isn't enough space for
them all to fit, as defined by their content and other CSS properties.
When omitted in the shorthand `flex` property value or when both `flex`
and `flex-shrink` are omitted, the shrink factor defaults to `1`. Like
the growth factor, the value of `flex-shrink` is always a number.
Negative numbers are not valid. You can use non-integer values if you
like, just as long as they're greater than 0.

Basically, the shrink factor defines how "negative available space" is
distributed when there isn't enough room for the flex items, and the
flex container isn't allowed to otherwise grow or wrap. See
[Figure 11-44](#ch11.xhtml_flex-shrink-0){data-type="xref"}.

[Figure 11-44](#ch11.xhtml_flex-shrink-0){data-type="xref"} is similar
to
[Figure 11-40](#ch11.xhtml_variety_of_growth_factor_scenarios){data-type="xref"},
except the flex items are set to `width: 300px` instead of 100 pixels.
We still have a 750-pixel-wide flex container. The total width of the
three items is 900 pixels, meaning the content starts out 150 pixels
wider than the parent flex container. If the items are not allowed to
shrink or wrap (see ["Wrapping Flex
Lines"](#ch11.xhtml_the-flex-wrap-property){data-type="xref"}), they
will burst out from the fixed-size flex container. This is demonstrated
in the first example in
[Figure 11-44](#ch11.xhtml_flex-shrink-0){data-type="xref"}: those items
will not shrink because they have a zero shrink factor. Instead, they
overflow the flex container.

<img src="./images/css5_1144.png" width="600" height="333"

</figure>

In the second example in
[Figure 11-44](#ch11.xhtml_flex-shrink-0){data-type="xref"}, only the
last flex item is set to be able to shrink. The last flex item is thus
forced to do all the shrinking necessary to enable all the flex items to
fit within the flex container. With 900 pixels of content needing to fit
into our 750-pixel container, we have 150 pixels of negative available
space. The two flex items with no shrink factor stay at 300 pixels wide.
The third flex item, with a positive value for the shrink factor,
shrinks 150 pixels, to end up 150 pixels wide. This enables the three
items to fit within the container. (In this example, the shrink factor
is `1`, but had it been `0.001` or `100` or `314159.65` or any other
positive number the browser could understand, the result would be the
same.)

In the third example, we have positive shrink factors for all three flex
items:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example3 flex-item {
  flex-shrink: 1;
}
#example3 flex-item:last-child {
  flex-shrink: 3;
}
```

As this is the only one of the three `flex` shorthand properties we
declared, this means the flex items will behave as if we had declared
the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example3 flex-item {
  flex: 0 1 auto; /* growth defaults to 0, basis to auto */
}
f#example3 flex-item:last-child {
  flex: 0 3 auto;
}
```

If all items are allowed to shrink, as is the case here, the shrinking
is distributed proportionally based on the shrink factors. This means
the larger a flex item's shrink factor, as compared to the shrink
factors of its sibling flex items, the more the item will shrink in
comparison.

With a parent 750 pixels wide, and three flex items with a width of 300
pixels, 150 "negative space" pixels need to be shaved off the flex items
that are allowed to shrink (which is all of them in this example). With
two flex items having a shrink factor of 1, and one flex item having a
shrink factor of 3, we have a total of five shrink factors:

-   (2 × 1) + (1 × 3) = 5

With five shrink factors, and a total of 150 pixels needing to be shaved
off all the flex items, each shrink factor is worth 30 pixels:

-   150 px ÷ 5 = 30 px

The default flex item size is 300 pixels, leading us to have two flex
items with a width of 270 pixels each and the last flex item having a
width of 210 pixels, which totals 750 pixels:

-   300 px -- (1 × 30 px) = 270 px
-   300 px -- (3 × 30 px) = 210 px

The following CSS produces the same outcome: while the numeric
representations of the shrink factors are different, they are
proportionally the same, so the flex item widths will be the same:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-item {
  flex: 1 0.25 auto;
}
flex-item:last-child {
  flex: 1 0.75 auto;
}
```

Note that the flex items in these examples will shrink to 210, 210, and
270 pixels, respectively, *as long as* the content (like media objects
or nonwrappable text) within each flex item is not wider than 210, 210,
or 270 pixels, respectively. If the flex item contains content that
cannot wrap or otherwise shrink in the main dimension, the flex item
will not shrink any further.

Suppose that the first flex items contain an image 300 pixels wide. That
first flex item cannot shrink, and other flex items can shrink;
therefore, it will not shrink, as if it had a null shrink factor. In
this case, the first item would be 300 pixels, with the 150 pixels of
negative space distributed proportionally based on the shrink factors of
the second and third flex items.

That being the case, we have four unimpeded shrink factors (one from the
second flex item, and three from the third) for 150 pixels of negative
space, with each shrink factor being worth 37.5 pixels. The flex items
will end up 300, 262.5, and 187.5 pixels, respectively, for a total of
750 pixels, as shown here and illustrated in
[Figure 11-45](#ch11.xhtml_flex-shrink-with-image){data-type="xref"}:

-   item1 = 300 px -- (0 × 37.5 px) = 300.0 px
-   item2 = 300 px -- (1 × 37.5 px) = 262.5 px
-   item3 = 300 px -- (3 × 37.5 px) = 187.5 px

Had the image been 296 pixels wide, that first flex item would have been
able to shrink by 4 pixels. The remaining 146 pixels of negative space
would then be distributed among the four remaining factors, yielding
36.5 pixels per factor. The flex items would then be 296, 263.5, and
190.5 pixels wide, respectively.

If all three flex items contained nonwrappable text or media 300 pixels
or wider, none of the three flex items would not shrink, appearing
similar to the first example in

### Proportional shrinkage based on width and shrink factor {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1013}

The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051143632 primary="flex-shrink property"
secondary="proportional shrinkage" data-type="indexterm"}preceding code
examples are fairly simple because all the flex items start with the
same width. But what if the widths are different? What if the first and
last flex items have a width of 250 pixels and the middle flex item has
a width of 500 pixels, as shown in
[Figure 11-46](#ch11.xhtml_flex-items-shrink-factor){data-type="xref"}?

</figure>

Flex items shrink proportionally relative to both the shrink factor
*and* the flex item's width, with the width often being the width of the
flex item's content with no wrapping. In
[Figure 11-46](#ch11.xhtml_flex-items-shrink-factor){data-type="xref"},
we are trying to fit 1,000 pixels into a flex container that's 750
pixels wide. We have an excess of 250 pixels to be removed from five
shrink factors.

If this were a `flex-grow` situation, we would simply divide 250 pixels
by 5, allocating 50 pixels per growth factor. If we were to shrink that
way, we would get flex items 200, 550, and 100 pixels wide,
respectively. But that's not how shrinking actually works.

Here, we have 250 pixels of negative space to proportionally distribute.
To get the shrink factor proportions, we divide the negative space by
the total of the flex items' widths (more precisely, their lengths along
the main-axis) times their shrink factors:

::: {data-type="equation"}
$$ShrinkPercent = \frac{NegativeSpace}{\left( (Width1 \times ShrF1) + ... + (WidthN \times ShrFN) \right)}$$
:::

Using this equation, we find the shrink percentage:

-   = 250 px ÷ \[(250 px × 1) + (500 px × 1) + (250 px × 3)\]
-   = 250 px ÷ 1500 px
-   = 0.166666667 (16.67%)

When we reduce each flex item by 16.67% times the value of
`flex-shrink`, we end up with flex items that are reduced as follows:

-   item1 = 250 px × (1 × 16.67%) = 41.67 px
-   item2 = 500 px × (1 × 16.67%) = 83.33 px
-   item3 = 250 px × (3 × 16.67%) = 125 px

Each reduction is then subtracted from the starting sizes of 250, 500,
and 250 pixels, respectively. Thus we have flex items that are 208.33,
416.67, and 125 pixels wide.

### Differing basis values {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1015}

When the []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_basis_shrink
primary="flex-basis property" secondary="shrink factor and"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_shrink_prop_basis
primary="flex-shrink property" secondary="differing basis values"
data-type="indexterm"}shrink factor has been set to `0`, and both the
width and flex basis of a flex item are set to `auto`, the item's
content will not wrap, even when you think it should. Conversely, any
positive shrink value enables content to wrap. Because shrinking is
proportional based on the shrink factor, if all the flex items have
similar shrink factors, the content should wrap over a similar number of
lines.

In the three examples shown in
[Figure 11-47](#ch11.xhtml_flex_items_shrink_proportionally){data-type="xref"},
the flex items do not have a declared width. Therefore, the width is
based on the content, because `width` defaults to `auto`. The flex
container has been made 520 pixels wide instead of our usual 750 pixels.

Note that in the first example, where all the items have the same
`flex-shrink` value, all content wraps over four lines. In the second
example, the first flex item has a shrink factor that's half the value
of the other flex items, so it wraps the content over (roughly) half the
number of lines. This is the power of the shrink factor.

In the third example, with no shrink factor, the text doesn't wrap at
all, and the flex items overflow the container by quite a bit.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1017}

As of late 2022, this "line-balancing" and refusal-to-wrap behavior is
not consistent across browsers. If you see different results when trying
this out for yourself, that may be why.
:::

Because the `flex` property's shrink factor reduces the width of flex
items proportionally, the number of lines of text in the flex items will
grow or shrink as the width shrinks or grows, leading to similar height
content within sibling flex items when the shrink factors are similar.

In the examples, take the contents of the flex items to be 280, 995, and
480 pixels, respectively---which are the widths of the nonwrapping flex
items in the third example (as measured by the developer tools, then
rounded to make this example a little simpler). This means we have to
fit 1,755 pixels of content into a 520-pixel-wide flex container by
shrinking the flex items proportionally based on their shrink factor. We
have 1,235 pixels of negative available space to proportionally
distribute.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1018}

Remember that you can't rely on web inspector tools to figure out shrink
factors for production. We're going through this exercise to show how
shrink factors work. If minutia isn't your thing, feel free to jump to
["The flex-basis Property"](#ch11.xhtml_flex-basis){data-type="xref"}.
:::

In our first example, the flex items will end up with the same, or
approximately the same, number of text lines. This is because flex items
shrink proportionally, based on the width of their content.

We didn't declare any widths, and therefore can't simply use an explicit
element width as the basis for our calculations, as we did in the
previous examples. Rather, we distribute the 1,235 pixels of negative
space proportionally based on the widths of the content---280, 995, and
480 pixels, respectively. We determine 520 is 29.63% of 1,755. To
determine the width of each flex item with a shrink factor of 1, we
multiply the content width of each flex item by 29.63%:

-   item1 = 280 px × 29.63% = 83 px
-   item2 = 995 px × 29.63% = 295 px
-   item3 = 480 px × 29.63% = 142 px

With the default of `align-items: stretch` (see ["Aligning
Items"](#ch11.xhtml_the-align-items-property){data-type="xref"}), a
three-column layout will have three columns of equal height. By using a
consistent shrink factor for all flex items, you can indicate that the
actual content of these three flex items should be of approximately
equal height---though, by doing this, the widths of those columns will
not necessarily be uniform.

In the second example in
[Figure 11-47](#ch11.xhtml_flex_items_shrink_proportionally){data-type="xref"},
the flex items don't all have the same shrink factor. The first flex
item will, proportionally, shrink half as much as the others. We start
with the same widths: 280, 995, and 480 pixels, respectively, but their
shrink factors are 0.5, 1.0, and 1.0. Because we know the widths of the
content, the shrink factor (*X*) can be found mathematically:

-   280 px + 995 px + 480 px = 1,615 px
-   (0.5 × 280 px) + (1 × 995 px) + (1 × 480 px) = 1,235 px
-   *X* = 1,235 px ÷ 1,615 px = 0.7647

We can find the final widths now that we know the shrink factor. If the
shrink factor is 76.47%, `item2` and `item3` will shrink by that amount,
whereas `item1` will shrink by 38.23% (because its `flex-shrink` value
is half the others). The amount of shrinkage in each case is rounded off
to the nearest whole number:

-   item1 = 280 px × 0.3823 = 107 px
-   item2 = 995 px × 0.7647 = 761 px
-   item3 = 480 px × 0.7647 = 367 px

Thus, the final widths of the flex items are as follows:

-   item1 = 280 px -- 107 px = 173 px
-   item2 = 995 px -- 761 px = 234 px
-   item3 = 480 px -- 367 px = 113 px

The total combined widths of these three flex items is 520 pixels.

Adding in varying shrink and growth factors makes it all a little less
intuitive. That's why you likely want to always declare the `flex`
shorthand, preferably with a width or basis set for each flex item. If
this doesn't make sense yet, don't worry; we'll cover a few more
examples of shrinking as we discuss
`flex-basis`.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797051069216 primary=""

responsive objects and layouts that can shrink proportionally without
breaking. For example, you can create a three-column layout that smartly
grows and shrinks without media queries, as shown on a wide screen in
[Figure 11-48](#ch11.xhtml_set_diff_values){data-type="xref"} and narrow
screen in

In this example, if the viewport is greater than 1,000 pixels, only the
middle column grows because only the middle column is provided with a
positive growth factor. We also dictate that below the 1,000-pixel-wide
mark, all the columns shrink.

Let's take it bit by bit. The `<nav>` and `<aside>` elements have the
following CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex: 0 1 200px;
min-width: 150px;
```

They don't grow from their basis but can shrink at equal rates. This
means they'll have the width of their flex basis by default. If they do
need to shrink, they'll shrink to a minimum width of `150px` and then
stop shrinking. However, if either one has an element that's more than
150 pixels wide, whether it's an image or a run of text, it will stop
shrinking as soon as it reaches the width of that bit of content.
Suppose a 180-pixel image dropped into the `<aside>` element. It would
stop shrinking as soon as it reaches 180 pixels wide. The `<nav>` would
keep shrinking down to 150 pixels.

The `<main>` element, on the other hand, has these styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex: 1 2 600px;
```

Thus, the `<main>` element can grow if there's space for it to do so.
Since it's the only flex item that can grow, it gets all the growth.
Given a browser window 1,300 pixels wide, the two side columns will be
200 pixels wide each, leaving 900 pixels of width for the center column.
In shrinking situations, the center column will shrink twice as fast as
the other two elements. Thus, if the browser window is 900 pixels wide,
each side column will be 175 pixels wide, and the center column 550
pixels wide.

Once the window reaches 800 pixels wide, the side columns will reach
their `min-width` values of `150px`. From then on, any narrowing will be
taken up by the center column.

Just to be clear, you are not required to use pixels in these
situations. You don't even have to use the same unit measures for
various flex basis values. The previous example could be rewritten like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav {
  flex: 0 1 20ch;
  min-width: 15vw;
}
article {
  flex: 1 2 45ch;
}
aside {
  flex: 0 1 20ch;
  min-width: 10ch;
}
```

We won't go through all the math here, but the general approach is to
set flex basis values on character widths for improved readability, with
some lower limits based on character widths and others on viewport
width.

Flexbox can be useful for a one-dimensional page layout like the one
shown in this section, with only three columns in a line. For anything
more complex, or for a more powerful set of options, use grid layout.

flex items, before extra or negative space is distributed---before the
flex items are allowed to grow or shrink according to the growth and

The flex []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050819200 primary="box-sizing property"
data-type="indexterm"}basis determines the size of a flex item's element
box, as set by `box-sizing`. By default, when a block-level element is
not a flex item, the size is determined by the size of its parent,
content, and box-model properties. When no size properties are
explicitly declared or inherited, the size defaults to its individual
content, border, and padding, which is 100% of the width of its parent
for block-level elements.

The flex basis can be defined using the same length value types as the
`width` and `height` properties---for example, `5vw`, `12%`, and
`300px`.

The universal keyword `initial` resets the flex basis to the initial
value of `auto`, so you might as well declare `auto`. In turn, `auto`
evaluates to the `width` (or `height`), if declared. If the value of
`width` (or `height`) is set to `auto`, the value of `flex-basis` is
evaluated to [`content`.]{.keep-together} This causes the flex item to
be sized based on the content of the flex item, though the exact method
for doing so is not made explicit in the specification.

[Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"},
but `fit-content` deserves a revisit here, and `content` needs to be
explored.

primary="flex-basis property" secondary="fit-content keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}using `fit-content` as the value for `flex-basis`,
the browser will do its best to balance all the flex items in a line so
that they are similar in block size. Consider this code, which is
illustrated in
[Figure 11-50](#ch11.xhtml_flex-basis-fit-sizing){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.flex-item {flex-basis: 25%; width: auto;}
.flex-item.fit {flex-basis: fit-content;}
```

</span>Fit-content flex-basis sizing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first flex line, the flex basis of the flex items is set to 25%,
meaning each flex item starts out with 25% the width of the flex line as
its sizing basis, and is flexed from there at the browser's discretion.
In the second flex line, the flex items are set to use `fit-content` for
their flex basis. Notice that more content leads to wider flex items,
and less to narrower items.

Also notice that the heights (more properly, the block sizes) of the
flex items are all the same, though this is not guaranteed: in certain
situations, some of the flex items could be a bit taller than the
others---say, by having one flex item's content wrap to one more line
than the others'. They should all be very close to the same, though.

This is a good illustration of one of the strengths of flexbox: you can
give a general direction to the layout engine and have it do the rest of
the work. Here, rather than having to figure out which widths should be
assigned to which flex items in order to balance out their heights, you
tell it `fit-content` and let it figure out the rest.

Using the `content` keyword has results generally similar to
`fit-content`, though some differences exist. A `content` basis is the
size of the flex item's content---that is, the length of the main-axis
size of the longest line of content or widest (or tallest) media object.
It's the equivalent of declaring `flex-basis: auto; inline-size: auto;`
on a flex item.

The value `content` has the effects shown in
[Figure 11-51](#ch11.xhtml_content_basis_width){data-type="xref"}.

In the first and third examples, the width of the flex item is the size
of the content; and the flex basis is that same size. In the first
example, the flex items' width and basis are approximately 132 pixels.
The total width of the three flex items side by side is 396 pixels, with
a few pixels of space between the items, all fitting easily into the
parent container.

In the third example, we have set a null shrink factor (`0`): this means
the flex items cannot shrink, so they won't shrink or wrap to fit into
the fixed-width flex container. Rather, they are the width of their
nonwrapped text. That width is also the value of the flex basis. The
three flex items' widths, and thus their basis values, are approximately
309, 1,037 pixels, and 523 pixels, respectively. You can't see the full
width of the second flex item or the third flex item at all, but they're
in the [chapter
files](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/11-flexbox).

The second example contains the same content as the third example, but
the flex items are defaulting to a shrink factor of 1, so the text in
this example wraps because the flex items can shrink. Thus, while the
width of the flex item is not the width of the content, the flex
basis---the basis by which it will proportionally shrink---is the width
of the [items' contents.]{.keep-together}

The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050758096 primary="flex-shrink property"
secondary="max-content keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050757088
primary="max-content keyword" data-type="indexterm"}third example in
[Figure 11-51](#ch11.xhtml_content_basis_width){data-type="xref"} is
also a good illustration of what would happen with the `max-content`
keyword with `flex-shrink: 0`: the flex basis for each item will be the
maximum size of its content. If flex shrinking is allowed, then the
browser will start with the `max-content` for the basis of each item's
flexing, and shrink them down from there. The difference between the two
is captured in the following code and illustrated in
[Figure 11-52](#ch11.xhtml_max_content_basis_width){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example1 {flex-basis: max-content; flex-shrink: 0;}
#example2 {flex-shrink: 1;}

</div>
</figure>

In the first example, where shrinking is not allowed, each flex item is
as wide as its content can get without wrapping. This causes the flex
items to overflow the container (because `flex-wrap` is not set to
`wrap`). In the second example, where `flex-shrink` is set to `1`, the
browser shrinks the flex items equally until they all fill out the flex
container without overflowing it. Note that the second of the four items
is a little taller than the others, because its shrinking happens to
require wrapping the content to one more line than the other items.

For a `min-content` flex []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050697200
primary="min-content keyword" data-type="indexterm"}basis, the reverse
happens. Consider the following, illustrated in
[Figure 11-53](#ch11.xhtml_min_content_basis_width){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example1 {flex-basis: min-content; flex-grow: 0;}
#example2 {flex-grow: 1;}
```

</span>Sizing flex items on a <code>min-content</code> basis, with and
without growing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first example, flex items are as narrow as possible while still
fitting their content. For elements containing text, this makes them
very tall, given that the block axis is vertical. (Note that the full
heights of the flex items in the first example have been clipped to keep
the figure to a reasonable size.) In the second example, the items are
allowed to grow, so they start from the `min-content` size and their
widths are grown equally until they all fill out the flex container
without overflowing it.

In the browser used to create
[Figure 11-53](#ch11.xhtml_min_content_basis_width){data-type="xref"},
the widths of the flex items in the first example added up to 361.1
pixels (rounded to the nearest tenth of a pixel), with 20 pixels of
space between each flex item. This means from the left edge of the first
item to the right edge of the last item is about 420.1 pixels. To arrive
at the result in the second example, given that the width of the flex
container is 1,200 pixels, the difference between the container width
and content width is 1,200 -- 420.1 = 778.9 pixels. This difference is
divided by 4, yielding approximately 194.7 pixels, and the width of each
of the four flex items is increased by that
amount.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050641632 primary=""

### Automatic flex basis {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1031}

When []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_basis_prop_auto
primary="flex-basis property" secondary="automatic flex basis"
data-type="indexterm"}set to `auto`, whether explicitly or by default,
`flex-basis` is the same as the main-axis size of the element, had the
element not been turned into a flex item. For length values,
`flex-basis` resolves to the `width` or `height` value, with the
exception that when the value of `width` or `height` is `auto`, the
flex-basis value falls back to `content`{.keep-together}.

When the flex basis is `auto`, and all the flex items can fit within the
parent flex container, the flex items will be their preflexed size. If
the flex items don't fit into their parent flex container, the flex
items within that container will shrink proportionally based on their
nonflexed main-axis sizes (unless the shrink factor is 0).

When there are no other properties setting the main-axis size of the
flex items (that is, there's no `inline-size`, `min-inline-size`,
`width`, or `min-width` set on these flex items), and `flex-basis: auto`
or `flex: 0 1 auto` is set, the flex items will be only as wide as they
need to be for the content to fit, as seen in the first example in
[Figure 11-54](#ch11.xhtml_when_flex_basis_set){data-type="xref"}. In
this case, they are the width of the text "flex-basis: auto," which is
approximately 110 pixels. The flex items are their preflexed size, as if
set to `display: inline-block`. In this example, they're grouped at
main-start because the `justify-content` property, the flex container's
`justify-content` defaults to `flex-start`.

In the second example in
[Figure 11-54](#ch11.xhtml_when_flex_basis_set){data-type="xref"}, each
flex item has a flex basis of `auto` and an explicitly declared width.
The main-axis size of the elements, had they not been turned into flex
items, would be 100, 150, and 200 pixels, respectively. And so they are
here, since they fit into the flex container without any overflow along
the main-axis.

In the third example in
[Figure 11-54](#ch11.xhtml_when_flex_basis_set){data-type="xref"}, each
of the flex items has a flex basis of `auto` and a very large explicitly
declared width. The main-axis size of the elements, had they not been
turned into flex items, would be 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 pixels,
respectively. Since they could not possibly fit into the flex container
without overflowing along the main-axis, and their flex shrink factors
have all defaulted to `1`, they shrink until they fit into the flex
container. You can do the math to find out how big they are using the
process outlined in ["Differing basis
values"](#ch11.xhtml_differing-bases){data-type="xref"}; as a hint, the
width of the third flex item should be reduced from 4,000 pixels to 240
pixels.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050588624 primary=""

the flex basis values are defaulting to `auto`, the growth factor is
defaulting to `0`, and the shrink factor of each item is defaulting to
`1`. For each flex item, the flex basis is its individual `width` value.
That means the flex basis values are being set to the values of the
`width` properties: 100, 200, and 300 pixels in the first example, and
200, 400, and 200 pixels in the second example. As the combined widths
of the flex items are 600 pixels and 800 pixels, respectively, both of
which are greater than the main-axis size of the 540-pixel-wide
containers, they are all shrinking proportionally to fit.

In the []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050572224 primary="flex-basis property"

`auto` flex basis values defaulted to the declared widths of the various

length units for our flex-basis value as we do for `width` and `height`.

When we have both `flex-basis` and `width` (or `height`, for vertical
main-axes) values, the basis trumps the width (or height). Let's add
basis values to the first example from
[Figure 11-55](#ch11.xhtml_when_no_flex_properties_are_set){data-type="xref"}.
The flex items include the following CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-container {
  width: 540px;
}
item1 {
  width: 100px;
  flex-basis: 300px;  /* flex: 0 1 300px; */
}
item2 {
  width: 200px;
  flex-basis: 200px;  /* flex: 0 1 200px; */
}
item3 {
  width: 300px;
  flex-basis: 100px;  /* flex: 0 1 100px; */
}
```

The widths are overridden by the basis values. The flex items shrink
down to 270 pixels, 180 pixels, and 90 pixels, respectively. Had the
container *not* had a constrained width, the flex items would have been
300 pixels, 200 pixels, and 100 pixels, respectively.

While the declared flex basis can override the main-axis size of flex
items, the size can be affected by other properties, such as
`min-width`, `min-height`, `max-width`, and `max-height`. These are not
ignored. Thus, for example, an element might have `flex-basis: 100px`
and `min-width: 500px`. The minimum width of `500px` will be respected,
even though the flex basis is smaller.

### Percentage units {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1037}

Percentage []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_flex_basis_prop_percent
primary="flex-basis property" secondary="percentage units"
data-type="indexterm"}values for `flex-basis` are calculated relative to
the size of the main dimension of the flex container.

We've already seen the first example in
[Figure 11-57](#ch11.xhtml_percentage-val-flex-basis){data-type="xref"};
it's included here to recall that the width of the text "flex-basis:
auto" in this case is approximately 110 pixels wide. In this case only,
declaring `flex-basis: auto` looks the same as writing
`flex-basis: 110px`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-container {
  width: 540px;
}
flex-item {
  flex: 0 1 100%;
}
```

In the second example in
[Figure 11-57](#ch11.xhtml_percentage-val-flex-basis){data-type="xref"},
the first two flex items have a flex basis of `auto` with a default
`width` of `auto`, which is as if their flex basis were set to
`content`. As we've noted previously, the `flex-basis` of the first two
items ends up being the equivalent of 110 pixels, as the content in this
case happens to be 110 pixels wide. The last item has its `flex-basis`
set to `100%`.

The percentage value is relative to the parent, which is 540 pixels. The
third flex item, with a basis of `100%`, is not the only flex item
within the nonwrapping flex container. Thus, it will not grow to be 100%
of the width of the parent flex container *unless* its shrink factor is
set with a null shrink factor, meaning it can't shrink, or if it
contains nonwrappable content that is as wide or wider than the parent
container.

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1039}

Remember: when the flex basis is a percent value, the main-axis size is
relative to the parent, which is the flex container.
:::

With our three flex basis values, if the content is indeed 110 pixels
wide, and the container is 540 pixels wide (ignoring other box-model
properties for simplicity's sake), we have a total of 760 pixels to fit
in a 540-pixel space. Thus we have 220 pixels of negative space to
distribute proportionally. The shrink factor is as follows:

-   Shrink factor = 220 px ÷ 760 px = 28.95%

Each flex item will be shrunk by 28.95%, becoming 71.05% of the width it
would have been, had it not been allowed to shrink. We can figure the
final widths:

-   item1 = 110 px × 71.05% = 78.16 px
-   item2 = 110 px × 71.05% = 78.16 px
-   item3 = 540 px × 71.05% = 383.68 px

These numbers hold true as long as the flex items can be that
small---that is, as long as none of the flex items contain media or
nonbreaking text wider than 78.16 pixels or 383.68 pixels. This is the
widest these flex items will be as long as the content can wrap to be
that width or narrower. We say "widest" because if one of the other two
flex items can't shrink to be as narrow as this value, they'll both have
to absorb some of that negative space.

In the third example in
[Figure 11-57](#ch11.xhtml_percentage-val-flex-basis){data-type="xref"},
the `flex-basis: auto` item wraps over three lines. The CSS for this
example is the equivalent of the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex-container {
  width: 540px;
}
item1 {
  flex: 0 1 70%;
}
item2 {
  flex: 0 1 auto;
}
item3 {
  flex: 0 1 80%;
}
```

We declare the `flex-basis` of the three flex items to be `70%`, `auto`,
and `80%`, respectively. Remembering that in our scenario `auto` is the
width of the nonwrapping content, which in this case is approximately
110 pixels, and our flex container is 540 pixels, the basis values are
equivalent to the following:

-   item1 = 70% × 540 px = 378 px
-   item2 = widthOfText("flex-basis: auto") ≈ 110 px
-   item3 = 80% × 540 px = 432 px

When we add the widths of these three flex items' basis values, they
have a total combined width of 920 pixels, which needs to fit into a
flex container 540 pixels wide. Thus we have 380 pixels of negative
space to remove proportionally among the three flex items. To figure out
the ratio, we divide the available width of our flex container by the
sum of the widths of the flex items that they would have if they
couldn't shrink:

-   Proportional width = 540 px ÷ 920 px = 0.587

Because the shrink factors are all the same, this is fairly simple. Each
item will be 58.7% of the width it would be if it had no flex-item
siblings:

-   item1 = 378 px × 58.7% = 221.8 px
-   item2 = 110 px × 58.7% = 64.6 px
-   item3 = 432 px × 58.7% = 253.6 px

What happens when the container is a different width? Say, 1,000 pixels?
The flex basis would be 700 pixels (70% × 1,000 pixels), 110 pixels, and
800 pixels (80% × 1,000 pixels), respectively, for a total of 1,610
pixels:

-   Proportional width = 1,000 px ÷ 1,610 px = 0.6211

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   item1 = 700 px × 62.11% = 434.8 px
-   item2 = 110 px × 62.11% = 68.3 px
-   item3 = 800 px × 62.11% = 496.9 px

Because with a basis of 70% and 80%, the combined basis values of the
flex items will always be wider than 100%, no matter how wide we make
the parent, all three items will always shrink.

If the first flex item can't shrink for some reason---whether because of
unshrinkable content, or another bit of CSS setting its `flex-shrink` to
`0`---it will be 70% of the width of the parent, 378 pixels in this
case. The other two flex items must shrink proportionally to fit into
the remaining 30%, or 162 pixels. In this case, we expect widths to be
378 pixels, 32.875 pixels, and 129.125 pixels. As the text "basis:" is
wider than that---assume 42 pixels---we get 378 pixels, 42 pixels, and
120 pixels.

Testing this out on your device will likely have slightly different
results, as the width of the text "flex-basis: auto" may not be the same
for you, depending on the font that gets used to render the text. (We
used Myriad Pro, with fallbacks to Helvetica and any generic sans-serif
font.)[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050322592 primary=""

basis defaults to `0`. While on the surface you might think the two
values of `auto` and `0` are similar, the `0` value is actually very
different and may not be what you expect.

In the case of `flex-basis: auto`, the basis is the main size of the
flex items' contents. If the basis of each of the flex items is `0`, the
available space is the main-axis size of the entire flex container. In
either case, the available space is distributed proportionally, based on
the growth factors of each flex item.

With a basis of `0`, the size of the flex container is divided up and
distributed proportionally to each flex item based on its growth
factors---its default original main-axis size as defined by `height`,
`width`, or `content` is not taken into account, though `min-width`,
`max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height` do impact the flexed size.

As shown in
[Figure 11-59](#ch11.xhtml_flex-basis-auto-vs-0){data-type="xref"}, when
the basis is `auto`, only the extra space is divided up proportionally
and added to each flex item set to grow. Again, assuming the width of
the text "flex: *X X* auto" is 110 pixels, in the first example we have
210 pixels to distribute among six growth factors, or 35 pixels per
growth factor. The flex items are 180, 145, and 215 pixels wide,
respectively.

</div>
</figure>

In the second example, when the basis is 0, all 540 pixels of the width
is distributable space. With 540 pixels of distributable space among six
growth factors, each growth factor is worth 90 pixels. The flex items
are 180, 90, and 270 pixels wide, respectively. While the middle flex
item is 90 pixels wide, the content in this example is narrower than 110
pixels, so the flex item didn't wrap.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050305472

Four of the flex values provide the most commonly desired effects:

`flex: initial`

:   Equivalent to `flex: 0 1 auto`. This sizes flex items based on the
    value of `inline-size` (which is equivalent to either `width` or
    `height`, depending on the direction of the inline axis), and allows
    shrinking but not growing.

`flex: auto`

:   Equivalent to `flex: 1 1 auto`. This sizes flex items based on the
    value of `inline-size`, but makes them fully flexible, allowing both
    shrinking and growing.

`flex: none`

:   Equivalent[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050273344
    primary="flex keyword, flex property" data-type="indexterm"} to
    `flex: 0 0 auto`. This sizes flex items based on the value of
    `inline-size`, but makes them completely inflexible: they can't
    shrink or grow.

`flex: <`*`number`*`>`

:   Equivalent to `flex: <`*`number`*`> 1 0`. This value sets the flex
    item's growth factor to the \<*`number`*\> provided. It also sets
    both the shrink factor and flex basis to `0`. This means the value
    of `inline-size` acts as a minimum size, but the flex item will grow
    if there is room to do so.

Let's consider each of these in turn.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Flexing with initial" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050266576 .sect3}
### Flexing with initial {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1045}

The global CSS []{#ch11.xhtml_ix_initial_key_flex
primary="initial keyword, flex property" data-type="indexterm"}keyword
`initial` can be used on all properties to represent a property's
initial value (its specification default value). Thus, the following
lines are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex: initial;
flex: 0 1 auto;
```

Declaring `flex: initial` sets a null growth factor, a shrink factor of
`1`, and the flex basis values to `auto`. In
[Figure 11-60](#ch11.xhtml_flex-shrink-flex-initial){data-type="xref"},
we can see the effect of the `auto` flex basis values. In the first two
examples, the basis of each flex item is `content`---with each flex item
having the width of the single line of letters that makes up the
content. However, in the last two examples, the flex basis values of all
the items are equal at 50 pixels, since `width: 50px` has been applied
to all the flex items. The `flex: initial` declaration sets the
`flex-basis` to `auto`, which we previously saw is the value of the
`width` (or `height`), if declared, or `content` if not declared.

In the first and third of these examples, we see that when the flex
container is too small to fit all the flex items at their default
main-axis size, the flex items shrink so that all fit within the parent
flex container. In these examples, the combined flex basis values of all
the flex items is greater than the main-axis size of the flex container.
In the first example, the width of each flex item varies based on the
width of each item's content and its ability to shrink. They all shrink
proportionally based on their shrink factor, but not narrower than their
widest content. In the third example, with each flex item's flex-basis
being 50 pixels (because of the value of `width`), all the items shrink
equally.

Flex items, by default, are grouped at main-start, as `flex-start` is
the default value for the `justify-content` property. This is noticeable
only when the combined main-axis sizes of the flex items in a flex line
are smaller than the main-axis size of the flex container, and none of
the flex items are able to grow.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050233680

### Flexing with auto {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1047}

The `flex: auto` option is similar to `flex: initial`, but makes the
flex items flexible in both directions: they'll shrink if there isn't
enough room to fit all the items within the container, and they'll grow
to take up all the extra space within the container if there is
distributable space. The flex items absorb any free space along the
main-axis. The following two statements are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex: auto;
flex: 1 1 auto;
```

[Figure 11-61](#ch11.xhtml_flex-auto-grow-shrink){data-type="xref"}
shows a variety of scenarios using `auto` flexing.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_flex-auto-grow-shrink" class="figure">

</div>
</figure>

The first and third examples of
[Figure 11-61](#ch11.xhtml_flex-auto-grow-shrink){data-type="xref"} are
identical to the examples in
[Figure 11-60](#ch11.xhtml_flex-shrink-flex-initial){data-type="xref"},
as the shrinking and basis values are the same. However, the second and
fourth examples are different. This is because when `flex: auto` is set,
the growth factor is `1`, and the flex items therefore can grow to
incorporate all the extra available space.

::: {#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050183504 .sect3}
### Preventing flexing with none {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1049}

Any `flex: none` flex items are inflexible: they can neither shrink nor
grow. The following two lines of CSS are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex: none;
flex: 0 0 auto;
```

[Figure 11-62](#ch11.xhtml_flex-none-no-grow-shrink){data-type="xref"}
shows the effects of `none`.

<figure>

class="play"><span class="play"><img
src="./images/play-icon-round.png" width="100"
height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

As demonstrated in the first and third examples of
[Figure 11-62](#ch11.xhtml_flex-none-no-grow-shrink){data-type="xref"},
if there isn't enough space, the flex items overflow the flex container.
This is different from `flex: initial` and `flex: auto`, which both set
a positive shrink factor.

The basis resolves to `auto`, meaning each flex item's main-axis size is
determined by the main-axis size of the element had it not been turned
into a flex item. The flex-basis resolves to the `width` or `height`
value of the element. If that value is `auto`, the basis becomes the
main-axis size of the content. In the first two examples, the
basis---and the width, since there is no growing or shrinking---is the
width of the content. In the third and fourth examples, the width and
basis are all 50 pixels, because that's the value of the `width`
property applied to them.

::::

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Numeric flexing" data-type="sect3"}
:::: {#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050138224 .sect3}
### Numeric flexing {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1051}

When the value of the `flex` property is a single, positive, numeric
value, that value will be used for the growth factor, while the shrink
factor will default to `1` and the basis will default to `0`. The
following two CSS declarations are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
flex: 3;
flex: 3 1 0;
```

This makes the flex item on which it is set flexible: it can grow. The
shrink factor is actually moot: the flex basis is set to `0`, so the
flex item can grow only from that basis.

In the first two examples in
[Figure 11-63](#ch11.xhtml_flex-n-grow-shrink){data-type="xref"}, all
the flex items have a flex growth factor of `3`. The flex basis is `0`,
so they don't "shrink"; they just grow equally from 0 pixels wide until
the sum of their main-axis sizes to fill the container along the
main-axis. With all the flex items having a basis of `0`, 100% of the
main dimension is distributable space. The main-axis size of the flex
items is wider in this second example because the wider flex container
has more distributable space.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_flex-n-grow-shrink" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1163.png" width="600" height="598"
alt="With flex: n, you&#39;re declaring the flex items growth factor while setting the flex basis to zero" />

class="play"><span class="play"><img
src="./images/play-icon-round.png" width="100"
height="100" /></span></a></h6>
</div>
</figure>

Any numeric value that is greater than 0, even 0.1, means the flex item
can grow. If there is available space to grow and only one flex item has
a positive growth factor, that item will take up all the available
space. If multiple flex items can grow, the available extra space will
be distributed proportionally to each flex item based on its growth
factor.

The last three examples of
[Figure 11-63](#ch11.xhtml_flex-n-grow-shrink){data-type="xref"} declare
six flex items with `flex: 0`, `flex: 1`, `flex: 2`, `flex: 3`,
`flex: 4`, and `flex: 5`, respectively. These are the growth factors for
the flex items, with each having a shrink factor of `1` and a flex basis
of `0`. The main-axis size of each is proportional to the specified flex
growth factor. You might assume that the `flex: 0` item with the text
"flex: 0" in the third example will be 0 pixels wide, as in the fourth
example---but, by default, flex items won't shrink below the length of
the longest word or fixed-size element.

By default, all flex items are assigned the order of `0`, with the flex
items all assigned to the same ordinal group and displayed in the same
order as their source order, along the direction of the main-axis. (This
has been the case for all the examples throughout this
[chapter.)]{.keep-together}

value to a nonzero integer. Setting the `order` property on elements

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch11.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1056}

Changing the []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050063024
primary="accessibility issues" secondary="order of flex items"
data-type="indexterm"}visual rendering order of flex items creates a
disconnect between the source order of elements and their visual
presentation. This can, in the words of the Mozilla Developer Network's
article on `order`, "adversely affect users experiencing low vision
navigating with the aid of assistive technology such as a screen
reader." It could also create problems for users who navigate by
keyboard and use a zoomed-in or otherwise magnified view of pages. In
other words: be very careful with `order`, and use it *only* in
production after much accessibility testing.
:::

The []{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797050059808 primary="ordinal group"
data-type="indexterm"}value of the `order` property specifies an
*ordinal group* to which the flex item belongs. Any flex items with a
negative value will appear to come before those defaulting to `0` when
drawn to the page, and all the flex items with a positive value will
appear to come after those defaulting to `0`. While visually altered,
the source order remains the same. Screen readers and tabbing order
remain as defined by the source order of the HTML.

For example, if you have a group of 12 items, and you want the seventh
to come first and the sixth to be last, you would declare the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {
  display: inline-flex;
}
li:nth-of-type(6) {
  order: 1;
}
li:nth-of-type(7) {
  order: -1;
}
```

In this scenario, we are explicitly setting the order for the sixth and
seventh list items, while the other list items are defaulting to
`order: 0`.
[Figure 11-64](#ch11.xhtml_setting-order-to-any){data-type="xref"} shows
the result.

<figure>
<div id="ch11.xhtml_setting-order-to-any" class="figure">

</div>
</figure>

The seventh flex item is the first to be laid out, because of the
negative value of the `order` property, which is less than the default
`0`, and is also the lowest value of any of its sibling flex items. The
sixth flex item is the only item with a value greater than 0, and
therefore has the highest-order value out of all of its siblings. This
is why it's laid out after all the other flex items. All the other
items, all having the default `order` of `0`, are drawn between those
first and last items, in the same order as their source order, since
they are all members of the same ordinal group (`0`).

The flex container lays out its content in order-modified document
order, starting from the lowest-numbered ordinal group and going up.
When multiple flex items have the same value for the `order` property,
the items share an ordinal group. The items in each ordinal group will
appear in source order, with the group appearing in numeric order, from
lowest to highest. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {
  display: inline-flex;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
li:nth-of-type(3n-1) {
  order: 3;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
li:nth-of-type(3n+1) {
  order: -1;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4);
}
```

By setting the same `order` value to more than one flex item, the items
will appear by ordinal group, and by source order within each individual
ordinal group.
[Figure 11-65](#ch11.xhtml_flex-items-appear-ordinal){data-type="xref"}
shows the result.

Here's what happened:

-   Items 2, 5, 8, and 11 were selected to share ordinal group `3`, and
    get a 20% opaque background.

-   Items 1, 4, 7, and 10 were selected to share ordinal group `-1`, and
    get a 40% opaque background.

-   Items 3, 6, 9, and 12 were not selected at all. They default to the
    ordinal group `0`.

The three ordinal groups, then, are `-1`, `0`, and `3`. The groups are
arranged in that order. Within each group, the items are arranged by
source order.

This reordering is purely visual. Screen readers *should* read the
document as it appears in the source code, though they may not. As a
visual change, ordering flex items impacts the painting order of the
page: the painting order of the flex items is the order in which they
appear, as if they were reordered in the source document, even though
they aren't.

Changing the layout with the `order` property has no effect on the tab
order of the page. If the numbers in
[Figure 11-65](#ch11.xhtml_flex-items-appear-ordinal){data-type="xref"}
were links, tabbing through the links would go through the links in the
order of the source code, *not* in the order of the layout.

The currently active tab has the `.active` class added, the `href`
attribute removed, and the `order` set to `-1`, which is less than the
default `0` of the other sibling flex items, meaning it appears first.

Why did we remove the `href` attribute? As the tab is the currently
active document, there is no reason for the document to link to itself.
But, more importantly, if it was an active link instead of a placeholder
link, and the user was using the keyboard to tab through the navigation,
the order of appearance is Blog, Home, About, Careers, and Contact Us,
with the Blog appearing first; but the tab order would have been Home,
About, Blog, Careers, and Contact Us, following the source order rather
than the visual order, which can [be confusing.]{.keep-together}

The `order` property can be used to enable marking up the main content
area before the side columns for mobile devices and those using screen
readers and other assistive technology, while creating the appearance of
the common three-column layout: a center main content area, with site
navigation on the left and a sidebar on the right, as shown way back in
[Figure 11-48](#ch11.xhtml_set_diff_values){data-type="xref"}.

While you can put your footer before your header in your markup, and use
`order` to reorder the page, this is an inappropriate use of the
property. The `order` property should be used only for visual reordering
of content. Your underlying markup should always reflect the logical
order of your content. Consider these two markup orders for the same
content, shown here side by side to make comparing them easier:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<header></header>               <header></header>
<main>                          <main>
   <article></article>            <nav></nav>
   <aside></aside>                <article></article>
   <nav></nav>                    <aside></aside>
</main>                         </main>
<footer></footer>               <footer></footer>
```

We've been marking up websites in the order we want them to appear, as
shown on the right in the code example, which is the same code as in our
three-column layout example
([Figure 11-48](#ch11.xhtml_set_diff_values){data-type="xref"}).

It really would make more sense if we marked up the page as shown on the
left, with the `<article>` content, which is the main content, first in
the source order: this puts the article first for screen readers, search
engines, and even mobile devices, but in the middle for our sighted
users on larger screens:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {
  display: flex;
}
main > nav {
  order: -1;
}
```

By using the `order: -1` declaration, we are able to make the `<nav>`
appear first, as it is the lone flex item in the ordinal group of `-1`.
The `<article>` and `<aside>`, with no `order` explicitly declared,
default to `order: 0`.

Remember, when more than one flex item is in the same ordinal group, the
members of that group are displayed in source order in the direction of
main-start to main-end, so the `article` is displayed before the
`aside`.

Some developers, when changing the order of at least one flex item, like
to give all flex items an `order` value for better markup readability.
We could have also written this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {
  display: flex;
}
main > nav {
  order: 1;
}
main > article {
  order: 2;
}
main > aside {
  order: 3;
}
```

In previous years, before browsers supported flex, all this could have
been done with floats: we would have set `float: right` on the `<nav>`.
While doable, flex layout makes this sort of layout much simpler,
especially if we want all three columns---the `<aside>`, `<nav>`, and
`<article>`---to be of equal heights.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797049480256

With flexible box layout, you can lay out sibling elements in ways that
are responsive to many layout contexts and writing modes, with a variety
of options for arranging those elements and aligning them to one
another.[]{#ch11.xhtml_idm45797049467120 primary=""
startref="ix_flexbox_ch11" data-type="indexterm"} It makes the task of
vertically centering elements within their parent elements almost
trivially easy, something that was very difficult in the years before
flexbox. It also serves as a powerfully useful bridge between
normal-flow and grid layout, which is the subject of the next chapter.

# [Chapter 12. ]{.label}Grid Layout

At its []{#ch12.xhtml_grid_layout_ch12 primary="grid layout"
data-type="indexterm"}inception, CSS had a layout-shaped hole at its
center. Designers bent other features to the purposes of layout, most
notably `float` and `clear`, and generally hacked their way around that
hole. Flexbox layout helped to fill it, but flexbox is really meant for
specific use cases, like navigation bars (navbars), as shown in
[Chapter 11](../Text/ch11.xhtml#flexbox){data-type="xref"}.

Grid layout, by contrast, is a *generalized* layout system. With its
emphasis on rows and columns, it might at first feel like a return to
table layout---and in certain ways that's not too far off---but there is
far, far more to grid layout than table layout.
[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049460416 primary="table layout"
secondary="versus grid layout" secondary-sortas="grid layout"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049459168
primary="grid layout" secondary="versus table layout"
secondary-sortas="table layout" data-type="indexterm"}Grid allows pieces
of the design to be laid out independently of their document source
order, and even overlap pieces of the layout, if that's your wish. CSS
provides powerfully flexible methods for defining repeating patterns of
grid lines, attaching elements to those grid lines, and more. You can
nest grids inside grids, or for that matter, attach tables or flexbox
containers to a grid. And much, much more.

In short, grid layout was the layout system we long waited for, and in
2017, it landed in all the major browser engines. It takes many, many
layouts that were difficult, or even impossible, and invariably fragile,
and allows you to create them simply, flexibly, and robustly.

# Creating a Grid Container {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1062}

The []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_container primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid container"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_cont_box_grid
primary="container box" secondary="grid layout"
data-type="indexterm"}first step to creating a grid is defining a *grid
container*. This is much like a containing block in positioning, or a
flex container in flexible-box layout: a
[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049452320 primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid-formatting context" data-type="indexterm"}grid container
is an element that defines a *grid formatting context* for its contents.

At []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049450160 primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid items" data-type="indexterm"}this basic level, grid
layout is quite reminiscent of flexbox. For example, the
[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049449056 primary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}child elements of a grid container become *grid
items*, just as the child elements of a flex container become flex
items. []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049447776 primary="nesting grids"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049447072
primary="grid layout" secondary="nesting grids"
data-type="indexterm"}The children of those grid items do *not* become
grid elements---although any grid item can itself be made a grid
container, and thus have its child elements become grid items to the
nested grid. It's possible to nest grids inside grids, until it's grids
all the way down.

CSS has two []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049445136 primary="inline grids"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049444400
primary="display property" secondary="grid layout"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049443456
primary="grid layout" secondary="inline grids"
data-type="indexterm"}kinds of grids: *regular* grids and *inline*
grids. These are created with special values for the `display` property:
`grid` and `inline-grid`. The first generates a block-level box, and the
second an inline-level box.
[Figure 12-1](#ch12.xhtml_grids_and_inline_grids){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the difference.

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_grids_and_inline_grids" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1201.png" width="600" height="124"

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1063"><span class="label">Figure 12-1.
</span>Grids and inline grids</h6>
</div>
</figure>

These are very similar to the `block` and `inline-block` values for
`display`. Most grids you create are likely to be block-level, though
the ability to create inline grids is always there should you need it.

Although `display: grid` creates a block-level grid, the specification
is careful to explicitly state that "grid containers are not block
containers." Although the grid box participates in layout much as a
block container does, there are differences between them.

First off, []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049434496 primary="floating"
secondary="grid layouts and"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049433488
primary="grid layout" secondary="floated elements and"
data-type="indexterm"}floated elements do not intrude into the grid
container. What this means in practice is that a grid will not slide
under a floated element, as a block container will. See
[Figure 12-2](#ch12.xhtml_floats_interact_differently){data-type="xref"}
for a demonstration of the difference.

Furthermore, the []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049429040 primary="margins"

secondary="collapsing" data-type="indexterm"}margins of a grid container
do not collapse with the margins of its descendants. Again, this is
distinct from block boxes, whose margins do (by default) collapse with
descendants. For example, the first list item in an ordered list may
have a top margin, but this margin will collapse with the list element's
top margin. The top margin of a grid item will *never* collapse with the
top margin of its grid container.
[Figure 12-3](#ch12.xhtml_margin_collapsing){data-type="xref"}

A few CSS []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049420144 primary="grid layout"
secondary="properties not applicable to"
data-type="indexterm"}properties and features do not apply to grid
containers and grid items:

-   All `column` properties[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049417344
    primary="column property" data-type="indexterm"} (e.g.,
    `column-count`, `columns`, etc.) are ignored when applied to a grid
    container. (You can learn more about multicolumn properties at [CSS
    Multi-Column
    Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns).)

-   The `::first-line` and `::first-letter`
    pseudo-elements[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049413200
    primary="::first-letter pseudo-element"
    primary-sortas="first-letter pseudo-element"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049412256
    primary="::first-line pseudo-element"
    primary-sortas="first-line pseudo-element" data-type="indexterm"} do
    not apply to grid containers and are ignored.

-   `float` and `clear` are[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049409264
    primary="float property"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049408528
    primary="clear property" data-type="indexterm"} effectively ignored
    for grid items (though not grid containers). Despite this, the
    `float` property still helps determine the computed value of the
    [`display`]{.keep-together} property for children of a grid
    container, because the `display`{.keep-together} value of the grid
    items is resolved *before* they're made into grid items.

-   The `vertical-align` property[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049404304
    primary="vertical-align property" secondary="grid items and"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049403296

    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049402352
    primary="alignment" secondary="vertical" data-type="indexterm"} has
    no effect on the placement of grid items, though it may affect the
    content inside the grid item. (Don't worry: we'll talk later about
    other, more powerful ways to align grid items.)

Lastly, if a []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049400416 primary="inline grids"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049399712
primary="grid layout" secondary="inline grids"
data-type="indexterm"}grid container's declared `display` value is
`inline-grid` *and* the element is either floated or absolutely
positioned, the computed value of `display` becomes `grid` (thus
dropping `inline-grid`).

Once you've defined a grid container, the next step is to set up the
grid within. Before we explore how that works, though, it's necessary to
cover some terminology.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049395728 primary=""
startref="ix_cont_box_grid"

# Understanding Basic Grid Terminology {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1066}

We've []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_term primary="grid layout"
secondary="terminology" data-type="indexterm"}already talked about grid
containers and grid items, but let's define them in a bit more detail.
[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049390256 primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid-formatting context" data-type="indexterm"}As we said
before, a *grid container* is a box that establishes a *grid-formatting
context*---that is, an area in which a grid is created and elements are
laid out according to the rules of grid layout instead of block layout.
You can think of it like the way an element set to `display: table`
creates a table-formatting context within it. Given the grid-like nature
of tables, this comparison is fairly apt, though be sure not to make the
assumption that grids are just tables in another form. Grids are far
more powerful than tables [ever were.]{.keep-together}

A *grid item* is a []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049386608
primary="grid layout" secondary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049385600
primary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049384928
primary="anonymous items" secondary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}thing that participates in grid layout within a
grid-formatting context. This is usually a child element of a grid
container, but it can also be the anonymous (that is, not contained
within an element) bits of text that are part of an element's content.
Consider the following, which has the result shown in
[Figure 12-4](#ch12.xhtml_grid_items){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#warning {display: grid;
    background: #FCC; padding: 0.5em;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr);}

<p id="warning"><img src="warning.svg"><strong>Note:</strong> This element is a
   <em>grid container</em> with several <em>grid items</em> inside it.</p>
```

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1067"><span class="label">Figure 12-4.
</span>Grid items</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice how each element, *and* each bit of text between the elements,
has become a grid item. The image is a grid item, just as much as the
elements and text runs---seven grid items in all. Each will participate
in the grid layout, although the anonymous text runs will be much more
difficult (or impossible) to affect with the various grid properties
we'll discuss.

If you're wondering about `grid-template-rows` and
`grid-template-columns`, we'll tackle them in the next section.
:::

In the course of using those properties, you'll create or reference
several core components of grid layout. These are summarized in
[Figure 12-5](#ch12.xhtml_grid_components){data-type="xref"}.

The []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_layout_lines primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid lines" data-type="indexterm"}most fundamental unit is
the *grid line*. By defining the placement of one or more grid lines,
you implicitly create the rest of the grid's components:

Grid track

:   A []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049256928 primary="grid layout"
    secondary="grid tracks" data-type="indexterm"}continuous run between
    two adjacent grid lines---in other words, a *grid column* or a *grid
    row*. It goes from one edge of the grid container to the other. The
    size of a grid track is dependent on the placement of the grid lines
    that define it. These are analogous to table columns and rows. More
    generically, these can be referred to as *block-axis* and
    *inline-axis* tracks, where (in Western languages) column tracks are
    on the block axis and row tracks are on the inline axis.

</span>Grid components</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Grid cell

:   Any []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049250544 primary="grid layout"
    secondary="grid cells"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049249536
    primary="grid cells" data-type="indexterm"}space bounded by four
    grid lines, with no grid lines running through it, analogous to a
    table cell. This is the smallest unit of area in grid layout. Grid
    cells cannot be directly addressed with CSS grid properties; that
    is, no property allows you to say a grid item should be associated
    with a given cell. (But see the next point for more details.)

Grid area

:   Any []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049247456 primary="grid layout"
    secondary="grid areas" data-type="indexterm"}rectangular area
    bounded by four grid lines and made up of one or more grid cells. An
    area can be as small as a single cell or as large as all the cells
    in the grid. Grid areas *are* directly addressable by CSS grid
    properties, which allow you to define the areas and then associate
    grid items with them.

An important point to note is that these grid tracks, cells, and areas
are entirely constructed of grid lines---and, more importantly, do not
have to correspond to grid items. There is no requirement that all grid
areas be filled with an item; it is perfectly possible to have some or
even most of a grid's cells be empty of any content. You can also have
grid items overlap each other, either by defining overlapping grid areas
or by using grid-line references that create overlapping situations.

Another fact to keep in mind is that you can define as many or as few
grid lines as you wish. You could literally define just a set of
vertical grid lines, thus creating a bunch of columns and only one row.
Or you could go the other way, creating a bunch of row tracks and no
column tracks (though there would be one, stretching from one side of
the grid container to the other).

The flip side is that if you create a condition preventing a grid item
from being placed within the column and row tracks you define, or if you
explicitly place a grid item outside those tracks, new grid lines and
tracks will be automatically added to the grid to accommodate, creating
implicit grid tracks (a subject we'll return to later in the
chapter).[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049244432 primary=""

With []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049220960 primary="explicit grid"
data-type="indexterm"}these properties, you can define the grid tracks
of your overall *grid template*, or what the CSS specification calls the
*explicit grid*. Everything depends on these grid tracks; fail to place
them properly, and the whole layout can easily fall apart.

Once you define a grid track, grid lines are created. If you create just
one track for the whole grid, two lines are created: one at the start of
the track and one at the end. Two tracks means three lines: one at the
start of the first track, one between the two, and one at the end of the
second track. And so on.

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1072}

When you're starting out with CSS grid layout, it's probably a good idea
to sketch out where the grid tracks need to be on paper first, or in
some close digital analogue. Having a visual reference for where the
lines will land, and how the tracks should behave, can make writing your
grid CSS a lot easier.
:::

The exact syntax patterns for \<*`track-list`*\> and
\<*`auto-track-list`*\> are complex and nest a few layers deep, and
unpacking them would take a lot of time and space that's better devoted
to just exploring how things work. There are a lot of ways to make all
this happen, so before we start discussing those patterns, we have some
basic things to establish.

First, []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049215440 primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid lines" tertiary="naming" data-type="indexterm"}grid
lines can always be referred to by number, but can also be explicitly
named by the author. Take the grid shown in
[Figure 12-6](#ch12.xhtml_grid_line_numbers_and_names){data-type="xref"},
for example. From your CSS, you can use any of the numbers to refer to a
grid line, or you can use the defined names, or you can mix them
together. Thus, you could say that a grid item stretches from column
line `3` to line `steve`, and from row line `skylight` to line `2`.

Note that a grid line can have more than one name. You can use any of
them to refer to a given grid line, though you can't combine them the
way you can multiple class names. You might think that means it's a good
idea to avoid repeating grid-line names, but that's not always the case,
as you'll soon see.

</span>Grid-line numbers and names</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We used intentionally silly grid-line names in
[Figure 12-6](#ch12.xhtml_grid_line_numbers_and_names){data-type="xref"}
to illustrate that you can pick any name you like, as well as to avoid
the implication that there are "default" names. If you'd seen `start`
for the first line, you might have assumed that the first line is always
called that. Nope. If you want to stretch an element from `start` to
`end`, you'll need to define those names yourself. Fortunately, that's
simple to do.

As we've said, many value patterns can be used to define the grid
template. We'll start with the simpler ones and work our way toward the
more complex.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1074}

We'll discuss the `subgrid` value in ["Using
Subgrids"](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid){data-type="xref"}, after establishing
how grid tracks and grid areas are defined, named, sized, combined, and
so on.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Using Fixed-Width Grid Tracks" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch12.xhtml_fixed-width-grid-tracks .sect2}
## Using Fixed-Width Grid Tracks {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1075}

As our initial step, let's create a
[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_line_fixw_track primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid lines" tertiary="fixed-width tracks"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797049199824
primary="grid layout" secondary="grid tracks"
startref="ix_grid_track_fixw" tertiary="fixed-width"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_fix_width_grid_track
primary="fixed-width grid tracks" data-type="indexterm"}grid whose grid
tracks are a fixed width. We don't necessarily mean a fixed length like
pixels or ems; percentages also count as fixed width here. In this
context, *fixed width* means the grid lines are placed such that the
distance between them does not change because of content changes within
the grid tracks.

So, as an example, this counts as a definition of three fixed-width grid
columns:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 50% 100px;}
```

That will place a line 200 pixels from the start of the grid container
(by default, the left side); a second grid line half the width of the
grid container away from the first; and a third line 100 pixels away
from the second. This is illustrated in
[Figure 12-7](#ch12.xhtml_grid_line_placement){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_grid_line_placement" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1207.png" width="600" height="165"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1076"><span class="label">Figure 12-7.
</span>Grid-line placement</h6>
</div>
</figure>

While it's true that the second column can change in size if the grid
container's size changes, it will *not* change based on the content of
the grid items. However wide or narrow the content placed in that second
column, the column's width will always be half the width of the grid
container.

It's also true that the last grid line doesn't reach the right edge of
the grid container. That's fine; it doesn't have to. If you want it
to---and you probably will---you'll see various ways to deal with that
in just a bit.

This is all lovely, but what if you want to
[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_line_name primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid lines" tertiary="naming" data-type="indexterm"}name your
grid lines? Just place any grid-line name you want, and as many as you
want, in the appropriate place in the value, surrounded by square
brackets. That's all! Let's add some names to our previous example, with
the result shown in
[Figure 12-8](#ch12.xhtml_grid_name_placement){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns:
        [start col-a] 200px [col-b] 50% [col-c] 100px [stop end last];
    }
```

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_grid_name_placement" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1208.png" width="600" height="214"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1077"><span class="label">Figure 12-8.
</span>Grid-line naming</h6>
</div>
</figure>

What's nice is that adding the names makes clear that each value is
actually specifying a grid track's width, which means there is always a
grid line to either side of a width value. Thus, for the three widths we
have, four grid lines are actually created.

Row grid lines are placed in exactly the same way as columns, as
[Figure 12-9](#ch12.xhtml_creating_a_grid){data-type="xref"} shows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns:
        [start col-a] 200px [col-b] 50% [col-c] 100px [stop end last];
    grid-template-rows:
        [start masthead] 3em [content] 80% [footer] 2em [stop end];
    }
```

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_creating_a_grid" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1209.png" width="600" height="357"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1078"><span class="label">Figure 12-9.
</span>Creating a grid</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We have a couple of things to point out here. First, both column and row
lines have the names `start` and `end`. This is perfectly OK. Rows and
columns don't share the same namespace, so you can reuse names like
these in the two contexts.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048998160 primary=""
startref="ix_grid_line_name" data-type="indexterm"}

Second is the percentage value for the `content` row track. This is
calculated with respect to the height of the grid container; thus, a
container 500 pixels tall would yield a `content` row that's 400 pixels
tall (because the percentage value of this row is `80%`). Doing this
generally requires that you know ahead of time how tall the grid
container will be, which won't always be the case.

You might think we could just say `100%` and have it fill out the space,
but that doesn't work, as
[Figure 12-10](#ch12.xhtml_exceeding_the_grid_container){data-type="xref"}
illustrates: the `content` row track will be as tall as the grid
container itself, thus pushing the `footer` row track out of the
container altogether:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns:
        [start col-a] 200px [col-b] 50% [col-c] 100px [stop end last];
    grid-template-rows:
        [start masthead] 3em [content] 100% [footer] 2em [stop end];
    }
```

<figure>

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1079"><span class="label">Figure 12-10.
</span>Exceeding the grid container</h6>
</div>
</figure>

One []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048906160 primary="minmax() function"
data-type="indexterm"}way (not necessarily the best way) to handle this
scenario is to *minmax* the row's value, telling the browser that you
want the row no shorter than one amount and no taller than another,
leaving the browser to fill in the exact value. This is done with the
`minmax(a,b)` pattern, where `a` is the minimum size and `b` is the
maximum size:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns:
        [start col-a] 200px [col-b] 50% [col-c] 100px [stop end last];
    grid-template-rows:
        [start masthead] 3em [content] minmax(3em,100%) [footer] 2em [stop end];
    }
```

This code indicates that the `content` row should never be shorter than
3 ems tall, and never taller than the grid container itself. This allows
the browser to bring up the size until it's tall enough to fit the space
left over from the `masthead` and `footer` tracks, and no more. It also
allows the browser to make it shorter than that, as long as it's not
shorter than `3em`, so this is not a guaranteed result.
[Figure 12-11](#ch12.xhtml_adapting_to_the_grid_container){data-type="xref"}
shows one possible outcome of this approach.

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_adapting_to_the_grid_container" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1211.png" width="600" height="246"

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1080"><span class="label">Figure 12-11.
</span>Adapting to the grid container</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In like fashion, with the same caveats, `minmax()` could have been used
to help the `col-b` column fill out the space across the grid container.
The thing to remember with `minmax()` is that if the *max* is smaller
than the *min*, the *max* value is thrown out and the *min* value is
used as a fixed-width track length. Thus, `minmax(100px, 2em)` would
resolve to `100px` for any font-size value smaller than `50px`.

If the []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048793152 primary="calc() function"
data-type="indexterm"}vagueness of `minmax()`'s behavior unsettles you,
CSS offers alternatives to this scenario. We could also have used the
`calc()` value pattern to come up with a track's height (or width). For
example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    grid-template-rows:
        [start masthead] 3em [content] calc(100%-5em) [footer] 2em [stop end];
```

That would yield a `content` row exactly as tall as the grid container
minus the sum of the `masthead` and `footer` heights, as we saw in the
previous figure.

That works as far as it goes, but is a somewhat fragile solution, since
any changes to the `masthead` or `footer` heights will also require an
adjustment of the calculation. It also becomes a lot more difficult (or
impossible) if you want more than one grid track to flex in this
fashion. As it happens, CSS has much more robust ways to deal with this
sort of situation, as you'll see next.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048760912

have been *inflexible*---their size determined by a length measure or
the grid container's dimensions, but unaffected by any other
considerations. *Flexible* grid tracks, by contrast, can be based on the
amount of space in the grid container not consumed by inflexible tracks;
or, alternatively, can be based on the actual content of the entire grid
track.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Fractional units" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch12.xhtml_fractional-units .sect3}
### Fractional units {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1082}

If you []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_unit_fraction primary="units of measure"
secondary="fractional"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_fraction_unit
primary="fr (fractional) unit" data-type="indexterm"}want to divide up
whatever space is available by a certain fraction and distribute the
fractions to various columns, the `fr` unit is here for you. An `fr` is
a flexible amount of space, representing a fraction of the *leftover*
space in a grid.

In the simplest case, you can divide up the whole container by equal
fractions. For example, if you want four columns, you could write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
```

In this very specific and limited case, that's equivalent to saying the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 25% 25%;
```

[Figure 12-12](#ch12.xhtml_dividing_the_container){data-type="xref"}
shows the result of either.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_dividing_the_container" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1083"><span class="label">Figure 12-12.
</span>Dividing the container into four columns</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This works because all of the grid container was "leftover space," so
all of it is available to be divided up by the `fr` lengths. We'll get
into how that plays out with nonflexible grid tracks in just a bit.

Going back to the previous example, suppose we want to add a fifth
column and redistribute the column sizes so they're all still equal. If
we used percentage values, we'd have to rewrite the entire value to be
five instances of `20%`. With `fr`, though, we can just add another
`1fr` to the value and have everything done for us automatically:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
```

The way `fr` units work is that all of the `fr` values are added
together, and all the leftover space in the grid is divided by that
total. Then each track gets the number of those fractions indicated by
its `fr` value.

In our first example, we had four `1fr` values, so their `1`'s were
added together to get a total of 4. The available space was then divided
by 4, and each column got one of those fourths. When we added a fifth
`1fr`, the space was divided by 5, and each column got one of those
fifths.

You are not required to always use `1` with your `fr` units! Suppose you
want to divide up a space into three columns, with the middle column
twice as wide as the other two. The code would look like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
```

Again, these values are added up to get 4, and then we divide that 4 by
1 (representing the whole), so the base `fr` in this case is `0.25`. The
first and third tracks are thus 25% the width of the container, whereas
the middle column is half the container's width, because it's `2fr`,
which is twice `0.25`, or `0.5`, or 50%.

You aren't limited to integers, either. A recipe card for apple pie
could be laid out using these columns:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 1fr 3.14159fr 1fr;
```

We'll leave the math on that one as an exercise for you. (Lucky you!
Just remember to start with `1 + 3.14159 + 1`, and you'll have a good
head start.)

This is a convenient way to slice up a container, but there's more here
than just replacing percentages with something more intuitive.
Fractional units really come into their own when we have some fixed
tracks and some flexible space. Consider, for example, the following,
which is illustrated in
[Figure 12-13](#ch12.xhtml_giving_the_center_column){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 15em 1fr 10%;
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_giving_the_center_column" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1213.png" width="600" height="181"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1084"><span class="label">Figure 12-13.
</span>Giving the center column whatever’s available</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Here, the browser assigns the first and third tracks to their inflexible
widths, and then gives whatever is left in the grid container to the
center track. For a 1,000-pixel-wide grid container whose `font-size` is
the usual browser default of `16px`, the first column will be 240 pixels
wide and the third will be 100 pixels wide. That totals 340 pixels,
leaving 660 pixels that aren't assigned to the fixed tracks. The
fractional units total 1, so 660 is divided by 1, yielding 660 pixels,
all of which are given to the single `1fr` track. If the grid
container's width is increased to 1,400 pixels, the third column will be
140 pixels wide and the center column 1,020 pixels wide.

Just like that, we have a mixture of fixed and flexible columns. We can
keep this going, splitting up any flexible space into as many fractions
as we like. Consider this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
width: 100em; grid-template-columns: 15em 4.5fr 3fr 10%;
```

In this case, the columns will be sized as shown in
[Figure 12-14](#ch12.xhtml_flexible_column_sizing){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_flexible_column_sizing" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1214.png" width="600" height="181"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1085"><span class="label">Figure 12-14.
</span>Flexible column sizing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The widths of the columns will be, from left to right: 15, 45, 30, and
10 ems. The first column gets its fixed width of `15em`. The last column
is `10%` of 100 em, which is 10 em. That leaves 75 ems to distribute
among the flexible columns. The two added together total 7.5 fr. For the
wider column, 4.5 ÷ 7.5 equals 0.6, and that times 75 ems equals 45 ems.
Similarly, 3 ÷ 7.5 = 0.4, and that times 75 ems equals 30 ems.

Yes, admittedly, we put a thumb on the scales for that example: the `fr`
total and `width` value were engineered to yield nice, round numbers for
the various columns. This was done purely to aid understanding. If you
want to work through the process with [less tidy]{.keep-together}
numbers, consider using `92.5em` or `1234px` for the `width` value in
the previous example.

If you want to define a[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_minmax_function
primary="minmax() function" data-type="indexterm"} minimum or maximum
size for a given track, `minmax()` can be quite useful. To extend the
previous example, suppose the third column should never be less than 5
ems wide, no matter what. The CSS would then be as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 15em 4.5fr minmax(5em,3fr) 10%;
```

Now the layout will have two flexible columns at its middle, down to the
point that the third column reaches `5em` wide. Below that point, the
layout will have three inflexible columns (`15em`, `5em`, and `10%`
wide, respectively) and a single flexible column that will get all the
leftover space, if there is any. Once you run the math, it turns out
that up to `30.5556em` wide, the grid will have one flexible column.
Above that width, there will be two flexible columns.

You might think this works the other way---for example, if you wanted to
make a column track flexible up to a certain point, and then become
fixed after, you would declare a minimum `fr` value. This won't work,
sadly, because `fr` units are not allowed in the *min* position of a
`minmax()` expression. So any `fr` value provided as a minimum will
invalidate the entire declaration.

Speaking of setting to 0, let's look at a minimum value explicitly set
to `0`, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: 15em 1fr minmax(0,500px) 10%;
```

[Figure 12-15](#ch12.xhtml_minmaxed_column_sizing){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the narrowest grid width at which the third column can
remain 500 pixels wide. Any narrower, and the `minmax`-ed column will be
narrower than 500 pixels. Any wider, and the second column, the `fr`
column, will grow beyond zero width while the third column stays at 500
pixels wide.

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1086"><span class="label">Figure 12-15.
</span>Minmaxed column sizing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If you look closely, you'll see the `1fr` label next to the boundary
between the `15em` and `minmax(0,500px)` columns. That's there because
the `1fr` is placed with its left edge on the second-column grid line,
and has no width, because there is no space left to flex. Similarly, the
`minmax` is placed on the third-column grid line. It's just that, in
this specific situation, the second- and third-column grid lines are in
the same place (which is why the `1fr` column has zero width).

If you ever run into a case where the minimum value is greater than the
maximum value, the whole thing is replaced with the minimum value. Thus,
`minmax(`{.keep-together}`500px,200px)` would be treated as a simple
`500px`. You probably wouldn't do this so obviously, but this feature is
useful when mixing things like percentages and fractions. Thus, you
could have a column that's `minmax(10%,1fr)` that would be flexible down
to the point where the flexible column was less than 10% of the grid
container's size, at which point it would stick at `10%`.

Fractional units and minmaxes are usable on rows just as easily as
columns; it's just that rows are rarely sized in this way. You could
easily imagine setting up a layout in which the masthead and footer are
fixed tracks, while the content is flexible down to a certain point.
That might look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-rows: 3em minmax(5em,1fr) 2em;
```

That works OK, but it's a lot more likely that you'll want to size that
row by the height of its content, not some fraction of the grid
container's height. The next section shows exactly how to make that
happen.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048354144 primary=""

### Content-aware tracks {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1087}

It's one thing to set up []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_line_cont_aware
primary="grid layout" secondary="grid lines" tertiary="content-aware"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_cont_aware_track
primary="content-aware grid tracks" data-type="indexterm"}grid tracks
that take up fractions of the space available to them, or that occupy
fixed amounts of space. But what if you want to line up a bunch of
pieces of a page and can't guarantee how wide or tall they might get?
This is where `min-content` and `max-content` come in. (See
[Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"}
for a detailed explanation of these keywords.)

What's so powerful about using these sizing keywords in CSS Grid is that
they apply to the entire grid track they define. For example, if you
size a column to be `max-content`, the entire column track will be as
wide as the widest content within it. This is easiest to illustrate with
a grid of images (12, in this case) with the grid declared as follows
and shown in
[Figure 12-16](#ch12.xhtml_sizing_grid_tracks_by_content){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#gallery {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: max-content max-content max-content max-content;
    grid-template-rows: max-content max-content max-content;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1088"><span class="label">Figure 12-16.
</span>Sizing grid tracks by content</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Looking at the columns, we can see that each column track is as wide as
the widest image within that track. Where a bunch of portrait images
happen to line up, the column is more narrow; where a landscape image
shows up, the column is made wide enough to fit it. The same thing
happens with the rows. Each row is as tall as the tallest image within
it, so if a row happens to have all short images, the row is also short.

The advantage here is that this works for any sort of content, no matter
what's in there. Say we add captions to the photos. All of the columns
and rows will resize themselves as needed to handle both text and
images, as shown in
[Figure 12-17](#ch12.xhtml_sizing_grid_tracks_around_mixed_content){data-type="xref"}.

This isn't a []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048267408
primary="max-content keyword" data-type="indexterm"}full-fledged
design---the images are out of place, and there's no attempt to
constrain the caption widths. In fact, that's exactly what we should
expect from `max-content` values for the column widths. Since it means
"make this column wide enough to hold all its content," that's what we
get.

What's []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048260880 primary="minmax() function"
data-type="indexterm"}important to realize is that this will hold even
if the grid tracks have to spill out of the grid container. Even if we'd
assigned something like `width: 250px` to the grid container, the images
and captions would be laid out just the same. That's why things like
`max-content` tend to appear in `minmax()` statements. Consider the
following, where grids with and without `minmax()` appear side by side.
In both cases, the grid container is represented by a shaded background
(see
[Figure 12-18](#ch12.xhtml_sizing_grid_tracks_minmax){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#g1 {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: max-content max-content max-content max-content;
    }
#g2 {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(0,max-content) minmax(0,max-content)
          minmax(0,max-content) minmax(0,max-content);
    }
```

</span>Sizing grid tracks with and without <code>minmax()</code></h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first instance, the grid items completely contain their contents,
but they spill out of the grid container. In the second, `minmax()`
directs the browser to keep [the columns]{.keep-together} within the
range of `0` and `max-content`, so they'll all be fitted into the grid
container if possible. A variant would be to declare
`minmax(min-content, max-content)`, which can lead to a slightly
different result than the `0, max-content` approach.

The reason that some images are overflowing their cells in the second
example is that the tracks have been fitted into the grid container
according to `minmax(0,max-content)`. They can't reach `max-content` in
every track, but they can get as close as possible while all still
fitting into the grid container. Where the contents are wider than the
track, they just stick out of it, overlapping other tracks. This is
standard grid behavior.

If you're []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797048151968 primary="min-content keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}wondering what happens if you `min-content` both
the columns and the rows, it's pretty much the same as applying
`min-content` to the columns and leaving the rows alone. This happens
because the grid specification directs browsers to resolve column sizing
first, and row sizing after that.

One more keyword you can use with grid track sizing is `auto`, which
also happens to be the default value for any grid track's width. As a
minimum, it's treated as the minimum size for the grid item, as defined
by `min-width` or `min-height`. As a maximum, it's treated the same as
`max-content`. You might think this means it can be used only in
`minmax()` statements, but this is not the case. You can use it
anywhere, and it will take on either a minimum or maximum role. Which
one it takes on depends on the other track values around it, in ways
that are frankly too complicated to get into here. As with so many other
aspects of CSS, using `auto` is essentially letting the browser do what
it wants. Sometimes that's fine, but in general you'll probably want to
avoid it.

###### Note {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1091}

There is a caveat to that last statement: `auto` values allow grid items
to be resized by the `align-content` and `justify-content` properties, a
topic we'll discuss in ["Setting Alignment in
Grids"](#ch12.xhtml_aligning-and-grids){data-type="xref"}. Since `auto`
values are the only track-sizing values that permit this, there may be

## Fitting Track Contents {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1092}

In []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_line_fit_cont primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid lines" tertiary="fitting content to"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_fit_content
primary="fit-content() function" data-type="indexterm"}addition to the
`min-content` and `max-content` keywords, a `fit-content()` function
allows you to more compactly express certain types of sizing patterns.
It's a bit complicated to decipher, but the effort is worth it:

The `fit-content()` function accepts a \<*`length`*\> or a
\<*`percentage`*\> as its argument, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid  {display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr fit-content(150px) 2fr;}
#grid2 {display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr fit-content(50%) 1fr;}
```

Before we explore what that means, let's ponder the pseudo-formula given
by the [specification:]{.keep-together}

-   fit-content(*argument*) =\> min(max-content, max(min-content,
    *argument*))

This means, []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_minmax_func2 primary="minmax() function"
data-type="indexterm"}essentially, "figure out which is greater, the
`min-content` sizing or the supplied argument, and then take that result
and choose whichever is smaller, that result or the `max-content` size."
Which is probably confusing!.

We feel that a better way of phrasing it is
"`fit-content(`*`argument`*`)` is equivalent to
`minmax(min-content,max-content)`, except that the value given as an
argument sets an upper limit, similar to `max-width` or `max-height`."
Let's consider this example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {display: grid; grid-template-columns: fit-content(50ch);}
```

The argument here is `50ch`, or the same width as 50 zero (`0`)
characters side by side. So we're setting up a single column that's
having its content fit to that measure.

For the initial case, assume the content is only 29 characters long,
measuring 29 ch (because it's in a monospace font). That means the value
of `max-content` is `29ch`, and the column will be only that wide,
because it minimizes to that measure---`29ch` is smaller than whatever
the maximum of `50ch` and `min-content` turns out to be.

Now, let's assume a bunch of text content is added so that there are 256
characters, thus measuring `256ch` in width (without any line wrapping).
That means `max-content` evaluates to `256ch`. This is well beyond the
`50ch` argument, so the column is constrained to be the larger of
`min-content` and `50ch`, which is `50ch`.

As further illustration, consider the results of the following, as shown
in
[Figure 12-19](#ch12.xhtml_sizing_grid_tracks_fit_content){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#thefollowing  {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns:
        fit-content(50ch) fit-content(50ch) fit-content(50ch);
    font-family: monospace;}
```

</span>Sizing grid tracks with <code>fit-content()</code></h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice the first column is narrower than the other two. Its `29ch`
content minimizes to that size. The other two columns have more content
than will fit into `50ch`, so they line-wrap, because their width has
been limited to `50ch`.

Now let's consider what happens if an image is added to the second
column. We'll make it `500px` wide, which happens to be wider than
`50ch` in this instance. For that column, the maximum of `min-content`
and `50ch` is determined. As we said, the larger value there is
`min-content`, which is to say `500px` (the width of the image). Then
the *minimum* of `500px` and `max-content` is determined. The text,
rendered as a single line, would go on past `500px`, so the minimum is
`500px`. Thus, the second column is now 500 pixels wide. This is
depicted in
[Figure 12-20](#ch12.xhtml_sizing_grid_tracks_fit_content_wide){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1094"><span class="label">Figure 12-20.
</span>Fitting to wide content</h6>

If you compare Figures
[12-19](#ch12.xhtml_sizing_grid_tracks_fit_content){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"} to
[12-20](#ch12.xhtml_sizing_grid_tracks_fit_content_wide){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"}, you'll see that the text in the second
column wraps at a different point, due to the change in column width.
But also compare the text in the third column. It, too, has different
line wraps.

That happens because after the first and second columns are sized, the
third column has a bit less than `50ch` of space in which to be sized.
The `fit-content(50ch)` function still does its thing, but here, it does
so within the space available to it. Remember, the `50ch` argument is an
upper bound, not a fixed size.

This is one of the great advantages of `fit-content()` over the less
flexible `minmax()`. It allows you to shrink tracks to their minimum
`content-size` when there isn't much content, while still setting an
upper bound on the track size when there's a lot of
content.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797047932064 primary=""

You may have been wondering about the repetitive grid template values in
previous examples, and what happens if you need more than three or four
grid tracks. Will you have to write out every single track width
individually? Indeed not, as you'll see in the [next
section.]{.keep-together}

## Repeating Grid Tracks {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1095}

If you []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_repeat_elem_track primary="repeating elements"
secondary="grid tracks"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_repeat_func
primary="repeat() function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_line_repeat
primary="grid layout" secondary="grid lines" tertiary="repeating"
data-type="indexterm"}want to set up a bunch of grid tracks of the same
size, you probably don't want to have to type out every single one of
them. Fortunately, `repeat()` is here to make sure you don't have to.

Let's say we want to set up a column grid line every 5 ems and have 10
column tracks. Here's how to do that:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 5em);}
```

That's it. Done. Ten column tracks, each one `5em` wide, for a total of
50 ems of column tracks. It sure beats typing `5em` 10 times!

Any track-sizing value can be used in a repeat, from `min-content` and
`max-content` to `fr` values to `auto`, and so on, and you can put
together more than one sizing value. Suppose we want to define a column
structure such that there's a `2em` track, then a `1fr` track, and then
another `1fr` track---and, furthermore, we want to repeat that pattern
three times. Here's how to do that, with the result shown in
[Figure 12-21](#ch12.xhtml_repeating_a_track_pattern){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 2em 1fr 1fr);}
```

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1096"><span class="label">Figure 12-21.
</span>Repeating a track pattern</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the last-column track is a `1fr` track, whereas the
first-column track is `2em` wide. This is an effect of the way the
`repeat()` was written. It's easy to add another `2em` track at the end,
in order to balance things out, by adding a `2em` after the `repeat()`
[expression:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 2em 1fr 1fr) 2em;}
```

This highlights the fact that `repeat` can be combined with any other
track-sizing values---even other repeats---in the construction of a
grid. The one thing you *can't* do is nest a repeat inside another
repeat.

Other than that, just about anything goes within a `repeat()` value.
Here's an example taken straight from the grid specification:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 10px [col-start] 250px [col-end]) 10px;}
```

In this case, there are four repetitions of a 10-pixel track, a named
grid line, a 250-pixel track, and then another named grid line. Then,
after the four repetitions, a final 10-pixel column track. Yes, that
means there will be four column grid lines named `col-start`, and
another four named `col-end`, as shown in
[Figure 12-22](#ch12.xhtml_repeated_columns_w_named_grid_lines){data-type="xref"}.
This is acceptable; grid-line names are not required to be unique.

One thing to remember, if you're going to repeat named lines, is that if
you place two named lines next to each other, they'll be merged into a
single, double-named grid line. In other words, the following two
declarations are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-rows: repeat(3, [top] 5em [bottom]);
grid-template-rows: [top] 5em [bottom top] 5em [top bottom] 5em [bottom];

### Autofilling tracks {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1099}

CSS []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_line_autofill_track primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid lines" tertiary="autofilling tracks"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_track_autofill
primary="grid layout" secondary="grid tracks" tertiary="autofilling"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_autofill_track
primary="autofilling grid tracks" data-type="indexterm"}provides a way
to set up a simple pattern and repeat it until the grid container is
filled. This doesn't have quite the same complexity as regular
`repeat()`---at least not yet---but it can still be pretty handy.

For example, suppose we want to have the previous row pattern repeat as
many times as the grid container will comfortably accept:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fill, [top] 5em [bottom]);
```

That will define a row line every 5 ems until there's no more room.
Thus, for a grid [container]{.keep-together} that's 11 ems tall, the
following is equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-rows: [top] 5em [bottom top] 5em [bottom];
```

If the grid container's height is increased past 15 ems, but is less
than 20 ems, then this is an equivalent declaration:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-rows: [top] 5em [bottom top] 5em [top bottom] 5em [bottom];
```

See
[Figure 12-23](#ch12.xhtml_auto-fill-rows-three-heights){data-type="xref"}
for examples of the autofilled rows at three grid container heights.

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_auto-fill-rows-three-heights" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1100"><span class="label">Figure 12-23.
</span>Autofilling rows at three heights</h6>
</div>
</figure>

One limitation with auto-repeating is that it can take only an optional
grid-line name, a fixed track size, and another optional grid-line name.
So `[top] 5em [bottom]` represents about the maximum value pattern. You
can drop the named lines and just repeat `5em`, or just drop one of the
names.

It's not possible to auto-repeat multiple fixed track sizes, nor can you
auto-repeat flexible track sizes. Similarly, you can't use intrinsic
track sizes with auto-repeated tracks, so values such as `min-content`
and `max-content` can't be put into an auto-repeated pattern.

data-type="indexterm"}might wish you could auto-repeat multiple track
sizes in order to define gutters around your content columns. This is
usually unnecessary because of the properties `row-gap` and `column-gap`
and their shorthand `gap`, which are covered in
[Chapter 11](../Text/ch11.xhtml#flexbox){data-type="xref"} but also
apply in CSS Grid.
:::

Furthermore, you can have only one auto-repeat in a given track
template. Thus, the following would *not* be permissible:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 4em) repeat(auto-fill, 100px);
```

However, you *can* combine fixed-repeat tracks with autofill tracks. For
example, you could start with three wide columns, and then fill the rest
of the grid container with narrow tracks (assuming there's space for
them). That would look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 20em) repeat(auto-fill, 2em);
```

You can flip that around too:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 2em) repeat(3, 20em);
```

That works because the grid layout algorithm assigns space to the fixed
tracks first, and then fills up whatever space is left with
auto-repeated tracks. The end result is to have one or more autofilled
2-em tracks, and then three 20-em tracks.
[Figure 12-24](#ch12.xhtml_auto-fill-columns-with-fixed){data-type="xref"}
shows two examples.

</div>
</figure>

With `auto-fill`, you will always get at least one repetition of the
track template, even if it won't fit into the grid container for some
reason. You'll also get as many tracks as will fit, even if some of the
tracks don't have content. As an example, suppose you set up an autofill
that places five columns, but only the first three actually end up with
grid items in them. The other two would remain in place, holding open
layout space.

If you use `auto-fit`, on the other hand, tracks that don't contain any
grid items will be compressed to a width of zero, though they (and their
associated grid lines) remain part of the grid. Otherwise, `auto-fit`
acts the same as `auto-fill`. Suppose the [following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 20em);
```

If the grid container has room for five column tracks (i.e., it's more
than 100 ems wide), but two tracks don't have any grid items to go into
them, those empty grid tracks will be dropped, leaving the three column
tracks that *do* contain grid items. The leftover space is handled in
accordance with the values of `align-content` and `justify-content`
(discussed in ["Setting Alignment in
Grids"](#ch12.xhtml_aligning-and-grids){data-type="xref"}). A simple
comparison of `auto-fill` and `auto-fit` is shown in
[Figure 12-25](#ch12.xhtml_auto-fill-and-auto-fit){data-type="xref"},

We could go through a wordy description of how this works, but it's a
lot more fun to just show it. The following rule has the result shown in
[Figure 12-26](#ch12.xhtml_simple_set_of_grid_areas){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "h h h h"
        "l c c r"
        "l f f f";}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_simple_set_of_grid_areas" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1226.png" width="600" height="114"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1106"><span class="label">Figure 12-26.
</span>A simple set of grid areas</h6>
</div>
</figure>

That's right: the letters in the string values are used to define how
areas of the grid are shaped. Really! And you aren't even restricted to
single letters! For example, we could expand the previous example like
so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header     header    header    header"
        "leftside   content   content   rightside"
        "leftside   footer    footer    footer";}
```

The grid layout is the same as that shown in
[Figure 12-26](#ch12.xhtml_simple_set_of_grid_areas){data-type="xref"},
though the name of each area would be different (e.g., `footer` instead
of `f`).

In defining template areas, the whitespace is collapsed, so you can use
it (as was done in the previous example) to visually line up columns of
names in the value of `grid-template-areas`. You can line up the names
with spaces or tabs, whichever will annoy your coworkers the most. Or
you can just use a single space to separate each identifier, and not
worry about the names lining up with one another. You don't even have to
line-break between strings; the following works just as well as a
pretty-printed version:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-areas: "h h h h" "l c c r" "l f f f";
```

What you can't do is merge those separate strings into a single string
and have it mean the same thing. Every new string (as delimited by the
quote marks) defines a new row in the grid. Thus the previous example,
like the examples before it, defines three rows. Say we merge them all
into a single string, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-areas:
    "h h h h
     l c c r
     l f f f";
```

Then we'd have a single row of 12 columns, starting with the four-column
area `h` and ending with the three-column area `f`. The line breaks
aren't significant in any way, except as whitespace that separates one
identifier from another.

If you look at these values closely, you may come to realize that each
individual identifier represents a grid cell. Let's bring back our first
example from this section, and consider the result shown in
[Figure 12-27](#ch12.xhtml_grid_cells_with_ids){data-type="xref"}, which
uses Firefox's Grid Inspector to label each cell:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "h h h h"
        "l c c r"
        "l f f f";}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_grid_cells_with_ids" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1227.png" width="600" height="135"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1107"><span class="label">Figure 12-27.
</span>Grid cells with their grid area identifiers</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797047190608 primary="grid cells"
data-type="indexterm"}is exactly the same layout result as in
[Figure 12-26](#ch12.xhtml_simple_set_of_grid_areas){data-type="xref"},
but here, we've shown how each grid identifier in the
`grid-template-areas` value corresponds to a grid cell. Once all the
cells are identified, the browser merges any adjacent cells with the
same name into a single area that encloses all of them---as long as they
describe a rectangular shape! If you try to set up more complicated
areas, the entire template is invalid. Thus, the following would result
in no grid areas being defined:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "h h h h"
        "l c c r"
        "l l f f";}
```

See how `l` outlines an *L* shape? That humble change causes the entire
`grid-template-areas` value to be dropped as invalid. A future version
of grid layout may allow for nonrectangular shapes, but for now, this
limitation exists.

If you want to define only some grid cells to be part of grid areas but
leave others unlabeled, you can use one or more `.` characters to fill
in for those unnamed cells. Let's say you just want to define some
header, footer, and sidebar areas, and leave the rest unnamed. That
would look something like this, with the result shown in
[Figure 12-28](#ch12.xhtml_grid_with_unnamed_cells){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header  header  header  header"
        "left    ...     ...     right"
        "footer  footer  footer  footer";}
```

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1108"><span class="label">Figure 12-28.
</span>A grid with some unnamed grid cells</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The two []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797047112320
primary="null cell tokens, grid layout" data-type="indexterm"}cells in
the center of the grid are not part of a named area, having been
represented in the template by *null cell tokens* (the `.` identifiers).
Where each of those `...` sequences appears, we could have used one or
more null tokens---so `left . . right` or `left` `...` `...` `right`
would work just as well.

You can be as simple or creative with your cell names as you like. If
you want to call your header `ronaldo` and your footer `podiatrist`, go
for it. You can even use any Unicode character above codepoint U+0080,
so `ConHugeCo©®™` and `åwësømë` are completely valid area
identifiers...as are emoji!
![](./images/joy_1f602.png){height="120" width="120"} Now, to
size the grid tracks created by these areas, we bring in our old friends
`grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`. Let's add both to the
previous example, with the result shown in
[Figure 12-29](#ch12.xhtml_named_areas_and_sized_tracks){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header  header  header  header"
        "left    ...     ...     right"
        "footer  footer  footer  footer";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 20em 20em 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 40px 10em 3em;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_named_areas_and_sized_tracks" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1229.png" width="600" height="123"

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1109"><span class="label">Figure 12-29.
</span>Named areas and sized tracks</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Thus, the columns and rows created by naming the grid areas are given
track sizes. If we give more track sizes than there are area tracks,
that will add more tracks past the named areas. Therefore, the following
CSS will lead to the result shown in
[Figure 12-30](#ch12.xhtml_adding_more_tracks){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header  header  header  header"
        "left    ...     ...     right"
        "footer  footer  footer  footer";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 20em 20em 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 40px 10em 3em 20px;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">

alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1110"><span class="label">Figure 12-30.
</span>Adding more tracks beyond the named areas</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So, given that we're naming areas, how about mixing in some named grid
lines? As it happens, we already have: naming a grid area automatically
adds names to the grid lines at its start and end. For the `header`
area, there's an implicit `header-start` name on its first-column grid
line *and* its first-row grid line, and `header-end` for its
second-column and -row grid lines. For the `footer` area, the
`footer-start` and `footer-end` names were automatically assigned to its
grid lines.

Grid lines extend throughout the whole grid area, so a lot of these
names are coincident.
[Figure 12-31](#ch12.xhtml_implicit_grid_line_names_explicit){data-type="xref"}
shows the naming of the lines created by the following template:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    grid-template-areas:
        "header    header    header    header"
        "left      ...       ...       right"
        "footer    footer    footer    footer";
```

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_implicit_grid_line_names_explicit" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1231.png" width="600" height="285"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1111"><span class="label">Figure 12-31.
</span>Implicit grid-line names made explicit</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now let's mix it up even more by adding a couple of explicit grid-line
names to our CSS. Given the following rules, the first-column grid line
in the grid would add the name `begin`, and the second-row grid line in
the grid would add the name `content`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header  header  header  header"
        "left    ...     ...     right"
        "footer  footer  footer  footer";
    grid-template-columns: [begin] 1fr 20em 20em 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 40px [content] 1fr 3em 20px;}
```

Again: those grid-line names are *added* to the implicit grid-line names
created by the named areas. Grid-line names never replace other
grid-line names. Instead, they just keep piling up.

Even more interesting, this implicit-name mechanism runs in reverse.
Suppose you don't use `grid-template-areas` at all, but instead set up
some named grid lines like so, as illustrated in
[Figure 12-32](#ch12.xhtml_implicit_grid_area_names_explicit){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    grid-template-columns:
         [header-start footer-start] 1fr
         [content-start] 1fr [content-end] 1fr
         [header-end footer-end];
    grid-template-rows:
        [header-start] 3em
        [header-end content-start] 1fr
        [content-end footer-start] 3em
        [footer-end];
```

<figure>
<div id="ch12.xhtml_implicit_grid_area_names_explicit" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1232.png" width="600" height="214"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1112"><span class="label">Figure 12-32.
</span>Implicit grid-area names made explicit</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Because the grid lines use the form of `name-start`/`name-end`, the grid
areas they define are implicitly named. To be frank, it's clumsier than
doing it the other way, but the capability is there in case you ever
want it.

Bear in mind that you don't need all four grid lines to be named in
order to create a named grid area, though you probably do need them all
to create a named grid area where you want it to be. Consider the
following example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    grid-template-columns: 1fr [content-start] 1fr [content-end] 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 3em 1fr 3em;
```

This will still create a grid area named `content`. It's just that the
named area will be placed into a new row after all the defined rows.
What's odd is that an extra, empty row will appear after the defined
rows but before the row containing `content`. This has been confirmed to
be the intended behavior. Thus, if you try to create a named area by
naming the grid lines and miss one or more of them, your named area will
effectively hang off to one side of the grid instead of being a part of
the overall grid structure.

So, again, if you want to create named grid areas, you should probably
stick to explicitly naming grid areas and let the `start-` and `end-`
grid-line names be created implicitly, as opposed to the other way
around.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797046718400 primary=""

</span>Attaching elements to grid lines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Here, we're using grid-line numbers to say where and how the elements
should be placed within the grid. Column numbers count from left to
right, and row numbers from top to bottom. If you omit ending grid
lines, as was the case for `.three`, then the next grid lines in
sequence are used for the end lines.

Thus, the rule for `.three` in the previous example is exactly
equivalent to this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.three {
    grid-row-start: 4; grid-row-end: 5;
    grid-column-start: 6; grid-column-end: 7;}
```

There's []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_span_grid_line primary="spanning grid lines"
data-type="indexterm"}another way to say that same thing, as it happens:
you could replace the ending values with `span 1`, or even just plain
`span`, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.three {
    grid-row-start: 4; grid-row-end: span 1;
    grid-column-start: 6; grid-column-end: span;}
```

If you supply `span` with a number, you're saying, "Span across this
many grid tracks." So we can rewrite our earlier example like this and
get exactly the same result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(5, 5em);
    grid-template-columns: repeat(10, 5em);}
.one {
    grid-row-start: 2; grid-row-end: span 2;
    grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end: span 2;}
.two {
    grid-row-start: 1; grid-row-end: span 2;
    grid-column-start: 5; grid-column-end: span 5;}
.three {
    grid-row-start: 4; grid-row-end: span 1;
    grid-column-start: 6; grid-column-end: span;}
```

If you leave out a number for `span`, it's set to be `1`. You can't use
0 or negative numbers for `span`; only positive integers.

An interesting feature of `span` is that you can use it for both ending
*and* starting grid lines. The precise behavior of `span` is that it
counts grid lines in the direction "away" from the grid line where it
starts. In other words, if you define a start grid line and set the
ending grid line to be a `span` value, it will search toward the end of
the grid. [Conversely,]{.keep-together} if you define an ending grid
line and make the start line a `span` value, it will search toward the
start of the grid.

That means the following rules will have the result shown in
[Figure 12-34](#ch12.xhtml_spanning_grid_lines){data-type="xref"} (the
column and row numbers were added for clarity):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-rows: repeat(4, 2em); grid-columns: repeat(5, 5em);}
.box1 {grid-row: 1; grid-column-start: 3;      grid-column-end: span 2;}
.box2 {grid-row: 2; grid-column-start: span 2; grid-column-end: 3;}
.box3 {grid-row: 3; grid-column-start: 1;      grid-column-end: span 5;}
.box4 {grid-row: 4; grid-column-start: span 1; grid-column-end: 5;}
```

</span>Spanning grid lines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In contrast to `span` numbering, you aren't restricted to positive
integers for your actual grid-line values. Negative numbers will count
backward from the end of explicitly defined grid lines. Thus, to place
an element into the bottom-right grid cell of a defined grid, regardless
of how many columns or rows it might have, you can just say this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-column-start: -1;
grid-row-start: -1;
```

Note that this doesn't apply to any implicit grid tracks, a concept
we'll get to in a bit, but only to the grid lines you explicitly define
via one of the `grid-template-*` properties (e.g.,
`grid-template-rows`).

We aren't restricted to grid-line numbers, as it happens. If there are
named grid lines, we can refer to those instead of (or in conjunction
with) numbers. If you have multiple instances of a grid-line name, you
can use numbers to identify which instance of the
[grid-line]{.keep-together} name you're talking about. Thus, to start
from the fourth instance of a row grid named `mast-slice`, you can say
`mast-slice 4`. Take a look at the following, illustrated in
[Figure 12-35](#ch12.xhtml_attaching_elements_to_named_grid_lines){data-type="xref"},
for an idea of how this works:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(5, [R] 4em);
    grid-template-columns: 2em repeat(5, [col-A] 5em [col-B] 5em) 2em;}
.one {
    grid-row-start: R 2;       grid-row-end: 5;
    grid-column-start: col-B;  grid-column-end: span 2;}
.two {
    grid-row-start: R;           grid-row-end: span R 2;
    grid-column-start: col-A 3;  grid-column-end: span 2 col-A;}
.three {
    grid-row-start: 9;
    grid-column-start: col-A -2;}
```

</span>Attaching elements to named grid lines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice how `span` changes when we add a name: specifying `span 2 col-A`
causes the grid item to span from its starting point (the third `col-A`)
across another `col-A` and end at the `col-A` after that. This means the
grid item actually spans four column tracks, since `col-A` appears on
every other column grid line.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797046003936 primary=""
startref="ix_span_grid_line" data-type="indexterm"}

Again, negative numbers count backward from the end of a sequence, so
`col-A -2` gets us the second-to-last instance of a grid line named
`col-A`. Because no end-line values are declared for `.three`, they're
both set to `span 1`. That means the following is exactly equivalent to
the `.three` in the previous example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.three {
    grid-row-start: 9; grid-row-end: span 1;
    grid-column-start: col-A -2; grid-row-end: span 1;}
```

There's an alternative way to use names with named grid
lines---specifically, the named grid lines that are implicitly created
by grid areas. For example, consider the following styles, illustrated
in
[Figure 12-36](#ch12.xhtml_another_way_of_attaching){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-areas:
    "header     header    header    header"
    "leftside   content   content   rightside"
    "leftside   footer    footer    footer";
#masthead {grid-row-start: header;
	grid-column-start: header; grid-row-end: header;}
#sidebar {grid-row-start: 2; grid-row-end: 4;
	grid-column-start: leftside / span 1;}
#main {grid-row-start: content; grid-row-end: content;
	grid-column-start: content;}
#navbar {grid-row-start: rightside; grd-row-end: 3;
	grid-column-start: rightside;}
#footer {grid-row-start: 3; grid-row-end: span 1;
	grid-column-start: footer; grid-row-end: footer;}
```

</span>Another way of attaching elements to named grid lines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If you supply a custom identifier (i.e., a name you defined), the
browser looks for a grid line with that name *plus* either `-start` or
`-end` added on, depending on whether you're assigning a start line or
an end line. Thus, the following are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-column-start: header;        grid-column-end: header;
grid-column-start: header-start;  grid-column-end: header-end;
```

This works because, as we mentioned with `grid-template-areas`,
explicitly creating a grid area implicitly creates the named `-start`
and `-end` grid lines that surround it.

The final []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797045786160 primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid flow, specifying" data-type="indexterm"}value
possibility, `auto`, is kind of interesting. According to the Grid
Layout specification, if one of the grid-line start/end properties is
set to `auto`, that indicates "auto-placement, an automatic span, or a
default span of one." In practice, this tends to mean that the grid line
that gets picked is governed by the *grid flow*, a concept we have yet
to cover (but will soon!). For a start line, `auto` usually means that
the next available column or row line will be used. For an end line,
`auto` usually means a one-cell span. In both cases, the word *usually*
is used intentionally: as with any automatic mechanism, there are no
absolutes.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797045782528 primary=""

```
The primary benefit of these properties is that they make it a lot
simpler to declare the start and end grid lines to be used for laying
out a grid item. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(10, [R] 1.5em);
    grid-template-columns: 2em repeat(5, [col-A] 5em [col-B] 5em) 2em;}
.one {
    grid-row: R 3 / 7;
    grid-column: col-B / span 2;}
.two {
    grid-row: R / span R 2;
    grid-column: col-A 3 / span 2 col-A;}
.three {
    grid-row: 9;
    grid-column: col-A -2;}
```

That's a whole lot easier to read than having each start and end value
in its own property, honestly. Other than being more compact, the
behavior of these properties is more or less what you'd expect. If you
have two bits separated by a forward slash (`/`), the first part defines
the starting grid line, and the second part defines the ending grid
line.

If you have only one value with no forward slash, it defines the
starting grid line. The ending grid line depends on what you said for
the starting line. If you supply a name for the starting grid line, the
ending grid line is given that same name. If a single number is given,
the second number (the end line) is set to `auto`. That means the
following pairs [are equivalent:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-row: 2;
grid-row: 2 / auto;

grid-column: header;
grid-column: header / header;
```

A subtle behavior built into the handling of grid-line names in
`grid-row` and `grid-column` pertains to implicitly named grid lines. As
you may recall, defining a named grid area creates `-start` and `-end`
grid lines. That is, given a grid area with a name of `footer`, there
are implicitly created `footer-start` grid lines to its top and left,
and `footer-end` grid lines to its bottom and right.

In that case, if you refer to those grid lines by the area's name, the
element will still be placed properly. Thus, the following styles have
the result shown in
[Figure 12-37](#ch12.xhtml_attaching_to_implicit_grid_lines){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header header"
        "sidebar content"
        "footer footer";
     grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
     grid-template-columns: 25% 75%;}
#header {grid-row: header / header; grid-column: header;}
#footer {grid-row: footer; grid-column: footer-start / footer-end;}
```

</span>Attaching to implicit grid lines via grid-area names</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You can always explicitly refer to the implicitly named grid lines, but
if you just refer to the grid area's name, things still work out. If you
refer to a grid-line name that doesn't correspond to a grid area, it
falls back to the behavior discussed previously. In detail, it's the
same as saying `line-name 1`, so the following two are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-column: jane / doe;
grid-column: jane 1 / doe 1;
```

This is why it's risky to name grid lines the same as grid areas.
Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    grid-template-areas:
        "header header"
        "sidebar content"
        "footer footer"
        "legal legal";
    grid-template-rows: auto 1fr [footer] auto [footer];
    grid-template-columns: 25% 75%;
```

This explicitly sets grid lines named `footer` above the "footer" row
and below the "legal" row...and now there's trouble ahead. Suppose we
add this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#footer {grid-column: footer; grid-row: footer;}
```

For the column lines, there's no problem. The name `footer` gets
expanded to `footer / footer`. The browser looks for a grid area with
that name and finds it, so it translates `footer / footer` to
`footer-start / footer-end`. The `#footer` element is attached to those
implicit grid lines.

For `grid-row`, everything starts out the same. The `footer` name
becomes `footer / footer`, which is translated to
`footer-start / footer-end`. But that means the `#footer` will only be
as tall as the "footer" row. It will *not* stretch to the second
explicitly named `footer` grid line below the "legal" row, because the
translation of `footer` to `footer-end` (due to the match between the
grid-line name and the grid-area name) takes precedence.

The upshot of all this: it's generally a bad idea to use the same name
for grid areas and grid lines. You might be able to get away with it in
some scenarios, but you're almost always better off keeping your line
and area names distinct, so as to avoid tripping over name-resolution
conflicts.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797045342768 primary=""

Up to this []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_implicit_grid primary="implicit grid"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_implicit
primary="grid layout" secondary="implicit grid"
data-type="indexterm"}point, we've concerned ourselves solely with
explicitly defined grids: we've talked about the row and column tracks
we define via properties like `grid-template-columns`, and how to attach
grid items to the cells in those tracks.

But what happens if we try to place a grid item, or even just part of a
grid item, beyond that explicitly created grid? For example, consider
the following grid:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 2em 2em;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 4em);}
```

Two rows, six columns. Simple enough. But suppose we define a grid item
to sit in the first column and go from the first-row grid line to the
fourth:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.box1 {grid-column: 1; grid-row: 1 / 4;}
```

Now what? We have only two rows bounded by three grid lines, and we've
told the browser to go beyond that, from row line 1 to row line 4.

What happens is that another row line is created to handle the
situation. This grid line, and the new row track it creates, are both
part of the *implicit grid*. Here are a few examples of grid items that
create implicit grid lines (and tracks) and how they're laid out (see
[Figure 12-38](#ch12.xhtml_creating_implicit_grid_lines_and_tracks){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.box1 {grid-column: 1; grid-row: 1 / 4;}
.box2 {grid-column: 2; grid-row: 3 / span 2;}
.box3 {grid-column: 3; grid-row: span 2 / 3;}
.box4 {grid-column: 4; grid-row: span 2 / 5;}
.box5 {grid-column: 5; grid-row: span 4 / 5;}
.box6 {grid-column: 6; grid-row: -1 / span 3;}
.box7 {grid-column: 7; grid-row: span 3 / -1;}

</span>Creating implicit grid lines and tracks</h6>
</div>
</figure>

A lot is going on there, so let's break it down. First off, the explicit
grid is represented by the filled-in box behind the various numbered
boxes; all the dashed lines represent the implicit grid.

What about those numbered boxes? The first, `box1`, adds an extra grid
row line after the end of the explicit grid. The second, `box2`, starts
on the last row-line of the explicit grid, and spans forward two
row-lines, so it adds yet another implicit row-line. The third, `box3`,
ends on the last explicit row-line (line 3) and spans *back* two lines,
thus starting on the first explicit row-line.

Things really get interesting with `box4`. It ends on the fifth
row-line, which is to say the second implicit row-line. It spans back
three row-lines---and yet, it still starts on the same row-line as
`box3`. This happens because grid track spans have to start counting
*within* the explicit grid. Once they start, they can continue into the
implicit grid (as happened with `box2`), but they *cannot* start
counting within the implicit grid.

Thus, `box4` ends on row-line 5, but its span starts with row-line 3 and
counts back two lines (`span 2`) to arrive at row-line 1. Similarly,
`box5` ends on row-line 5 and spans back four lines, which means it
starts on row-line --2. Remember: span counting must *start* in the
explicit grid. It doesn't have to end there.

After those, `box6` starts on the last explicit row-line (line 3), and
spans out to the sixth row-line---adding yet another implicit row-line.
The point of having it here is to show that negative grid-line
references are with respect to the explicit grid, and count back from
its end. They do *not* refer to negatively indexed implicit lines that
are placed before the start of the explicit grid.

If you want to start an element on an implicit grid line before the
explicit grid's start, the way to do that is shown by `box7`: put its
end line somewhere in the explicit grid, and span back past the
beginning of the explicit grid. And you may have noticed: `box7`
occupies an implicit column track. The original grid was set up to
[create]{.keep-together} six columns, which means seven column-lines,
the seventh being the end of the explicit grid. When `box7` was given
`grid-column: 7`, that was equivalent to `grid-column: 7 / span 1`
(since a missing end line is always assumed to be `span 1`). That
necessitated the creation of an implicit column-line in order to hold
the grid item in the implicit seventh column.

Now let's take those principles and add named grid lines to the mix.
Consider the following, illustrated in
[Figure 12-39](#ch12.xhtml_named_implicit_grid_lines_and_tracks){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: [begin] 2em [middle] 2em [end];
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 5em);}
.box1 {grid-column: 1; grid-row: 2 / span end 2;}
.box2 {grid-column: 2; grid-row: 2 / span final;}
.box3 {grid-column: 3; grid-row: 1 / span 3 middle;}
.box4 {grid-column: 4; grid-row: span begin 2 / end;}
.box5 {grid-column: 5; grid-row: span 2 middle / begin;}
```

What you can see at work in several of these examples is what happens
with grid-line names in the implicit grid: every implicitly created line
has the name that's being hunted. Take `box2`, for example. It's given
an end line of `final`, but there is no line with that name. Thus the
span-search goes to the end of the explicit grid and, having not found
the name it's looking for, creates a new grid line, to which it attaches
the name `final`. (In
[Figure 12-39](#ch12.xhtml_named_implicit_grid_lines_and_tracks){data-type="xref"},
the implicitly created line names are italicized and faded out a bit.)

</span>Named implicit grid lines and tracks</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Similarly, `box3` starts on the first explicit row-line, and then needs
to span three `middle`{.keep-together} named lines. It searches forward
and finds one, then goes looking for the other two. Not finding any, it
attaches the name `middle` to the first implicit row-line, and then does
the same for the second implicit row-line. Thus, it ends two implicit
row-lines past the end of the explicit grid.

The same sort of thing happens with `box4` and `box5`, except working
backward from endpoints. You can see that `box4` ends with the `end`
row-line (line 3), then spans back to the second `begin` row-line it can
find. This causes an implicit row-line to be created before the first
row-line, named `begin`. Finally, `box5` spans back from `begin` (the
explicitly labeled `begin`) to the second `middle` it can find. Since it
can't find any, it labels two implicit row-line `middle` and ends at the
one farthest from where it started
looking.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797044920736 primary=""

## Handling Errors {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1126}

We []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797044917440 primary="grid layout"
secondary="error handling when placing" data-type="indexterm"}need to
cover a few cases, as they fall under the general umbrella of "what
grids do when things go pear-shaped." First, what if you accidentally
put the start line after the end line? Say, something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-row-start: 5;
grid-row-end: 2;
```

All that happens is probably what was meant in the first place: the
values are [swapped]{.keep-together}. Thus, you end up with the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-row-start: 2;
grid-row-end: 5;
```

Second, what if both the start and the end lines are declared to be
spans of some variety? For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-column-start: span;
grid-column-end: span 3;
```

If this happens, the end value is dropped and replaced with `auto`. That
means you'd end up with this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-column-start: span;  /* 'span' is equal to 'span 1' */
grid-column-end: auto;
```

That would cause the grid item to have its ending edge placed
automatically, according to the current grid flow (a subject we'll soon
explore), and the starting edge to be placed one grid line earlier.

Third, what if the only thing directing placement of the grid item is a
named span? In other words, you'd have this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-row-start: span footer;
grid-row-end: auto;
```

This is not permitted, so the `span footer` in this case is replaced
with `span 1`.

Let's start with a simple use of `grid-area`: assigning an element to a
previously defined grid area. For this, we'll bring back our old friend
`grid-template-areas`, put it together with `grid-area` and some markup,
and see what magic results (as shown in
[Figure 12-40](#ch12.xhtml_assigning_elements_to_grid_areas){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 200px 1fr 3em;
    grid-template-columns: 20em 1fr 1fr 10em;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header     header    header    header"
        "leftside   content   content   rightside"
        "leftside   footer    footer    footer";}
#masthead {grid-area: header;}
#sidebar {grid-area: leftside;}
#main {grid-area: content;}
#navbar {grid-area: rightside;}
#footer {grid-area: footer;}

That's all it takes: set up some named grid areas to define your layout,
and then drop grid items into them with `grid-area`. So simple and yet
so powerful.

Another way to use `grid-area` refers to grid lines instead of grid
areas. Fair warning: it's likely to be confusing at first.

Here's an example of a grid template that defines some grid lines, and
some `grid-area` rules that reference the lines, as illustrated in
[Figure 12-41](#ch12.xhtml_assigning_elements_to_grid_lines){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows:
        [r1-start] 1fr [r1-end r2-start] 2fr [r2-end];
    grid-template-columns:
        [col-start] 1fr [col-end main-start] 1fr [main-end];}
.box01 {grid-area: r1 / main / r1 / main;}
.box02 {grid-area: r2-start / col-start / r2-end / main-end;}
.box03 {grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 2;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1130"><span class="label">Figure 12-41.
</span>Assigning elements to grid lines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

These elements were placed as directed. Note the ordering of the
grid-line values, however. They're listed in the order `row-start`,
`column-start`, `row-end`, `column-end`. If you diagram that in your
head, you'll quickly realize that the values go counterclockwise (also
called anticlockwise) around the grid item---the exact opposite of the
TRBL pattern we're used to from margins, padding, borders, and so on.
Furthermore, this means the column and row references are not grouped
together but are instead split up.

If you supply fewer than four values, then the missing values are taken
from those you do supply. If you use only three values, then the missing
`grid-column-end` is the same as `grid-column-start` if it's a name; if
the start line is a number, the end line is set to `auto`. The same
holds true if you give only two values, except that the now-missing
`grid-row-end` is copied from `grid-row-start` if it's a name;
otherwise, it's set [to `auto`.]{.keep-together}

From that, you can probably guess what happens if only one value is
supplied: if it's a name, use it for all four values; if it's a number,
the rest are set to `auto`.

This one-to-four replication pattern is actually how giving a single
grid-area name translates into having the grid item fill that area. The
following are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-area: footer;
grid-area: footer / footer / footer / footer;
```

Now recall the behavior discussed in the previous section about
`grid-column` and `grid-row`: if a grid line's name matches the name of
a grid area, it's translated into a `-start` or `-end` variant, as
appropriate. That means the previous example is translated to the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-area: footer-start / footer-start / footer-end / footer-end;
```

And that's how a single grid-area name causes an element to be placed
into the corresponding grid area.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797044380592

## Understanding Grid-Item Overlap {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1131}

One []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797044342960 primary="grid layout"
secondary="overlapping elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797044341952
primary="overlapping elements" secondary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}thing we've been very careful to do in our grid
layouts thus far is to avoid overlap. Rather like positioning, it's
absolutely (get it?) possible to make grid items overlap each other.
Let's take a simple case, illustrated in
[Figure 12-42](#ch12.xhtml_overlapping_grid_items){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 50% 50%;
    grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;}
.box01 {grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 3;}
.box02 {grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 2;}
```

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1132"><span class="label">Figure 12-42.
</span>Overlapping grid items</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Thanks to the grid numbers that were supplied in the last two lines of
the CSS, the two grid items overlap in the upper-right grid cell. Which
is on top of the other depends on the layering behavior we'll discuss
later, but for now, just take it as a given that they do layer when
overlapping.

There may well be times when you want grid items to overlap. A photo's
caption might partially overlap the photo, for example. Or you might
want to assign a few items to the same grid area so they combine, or set
them to be shown one at a time by script or user interaction.

Overlap isn't restricted to situations involving raw grid numbers. In
the following case, the sidebar and the footer will overlap, as shown in
[Figure 12-43](#ch12.xhtml_overlapping_sidebar_and_footer){data-type="xref"}.
(Assuming the footer comes later than the sidebar in the markup, then in
the absence of other styles, the footer will be on top of the sidebar.)

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header header"
        "sidebar content"
        "footer footer";}
#header {grid-area: header;}
#sidebar {grid-area: sidebar / sidebar / footer-end / sidebar;}
#footer {grid-area: footer;}
```

</figure>

We bring this up in part to warn you about the possibility of overlap,
and also to serve as a transition to the next topic. It's a feature that
sets grid layout apart from positioning, in that it can sometimes help
avoid overlap: the concept of *grid flow*.

# Specifying Grid Flow {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1134}

For the most part, we've been explicitly placing grid items on the grid.
If items aren't []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_flow primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid flow, specifying"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_auto_flow_prop
primary="grid-auto-flow property" data-type="indexterm"}explicitly
placed, they're automatically placed into the grid. Following the
grid-flow direction that's in effect, an item is placed in the first
area that will fit it. The simplest case is just filling a grid track in
sequence, one grid item after another, but things can get a lot more
complex than that, especially if there is a mixture of explicitly and
automatically placed grid items. The latter must work around the former.

CSS has primarily two grid-flow models, *row-first* and *column-first*,
though you can enhance either by specifying a *dense* flow. All this is
done with the property called [`grid-auto-flow`.]{.keep-together}

```{=html}
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar">
```

  **Inherited**        No
  **Animatable**       No
  -------------------- -----------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
To see how these values work, consider the following markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ol id="grid">
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
<li>4</li>
<li>5</li>
</ol>
```

To that markup, let's apply the following styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid; width: 45em; height: 8em;
    grid-auto-flow: row;}
#grid li {grid-row: auto; grid-column: auto;}
```

Assuming a grid with a column line every 15 ems and a row line every 4
ems, we get the result shown in
[Figure 12-44](#ch12.xhtml_row-oriented_grid_flow){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_row-oriented_grid_flow" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1136"><span class="label">Figure 12-44.
</span>Row-oriented grid flow</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This probably seems pretty normal, the same sort of thing you'd get if
you floated all the boxes, or if all of them were inline blocks. That
familiarity is why `row` is the default value. Now, let's try switching
the `grid-auto-flow` value to `column`, as shown in
[Figure 12-45](#ch12.xhtml_column-oriented_grid_flow){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid; width: 45em; height: 8em;
    grid-auto-flow: column;}
#grid li {grid-row: auto; grid-column: auto;}
```

So with `grid-auto-flow: row`, each row is filled in before starting on
the next row. With `grid-auto-flow: column`, each column is filled
first.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_column-oriented_grid_flow" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1137"><span class="label">Figure 12-45.
</span>Column-oriented grid flow</h6>
</div>
</figure>

What needs to be stressed here is that the list items weren't explicitly
sized. By default, they were resized to attach to the defined grid
lines. This can be overridden by assigning explicit sizing to the
elements. For example, if we make the list items 7 ems wide and 1.5 ems
tall, we'll get the result shown in
[Figure 12-46](#ch12.xhtml_explicitly_sized_grid_items){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid; width: 45em; height: 8em;
    grid-auto-flow: column;}
#grid li {grid-row: auto; grid-column: auto;
    width: 7em; height: 1.5em;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1138"><span class="label">Figure 12-46.
</span>Explicitly sized grid items</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If you compare that to the previous figure, you'll see that the
corresponding grid items start in the same place; they just don't end in
the same places. This illustrates that what's really placed in grid flow
is grid areas, to which the grid items are then attached.

This is important to keep in mind if you auto-flow elements that are
wider than their assigned column or taller than their assigned row, as
can very easily happen when turning images or other intrinsically sized
elements into grid items. Let's say we want to put a bunch of images,
each a different size, into a grid that's set up to have a column line
every 50 horizontal pixels, and a row line every 50 vertical pixels.
This grid is illustrated in
[Figure 12-47](#ch12.xhtml_flowing_images_in_grids){data-type="xref"},
along with the results of flowing a series of images into that grid by
either row or column:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 50px);
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 50px);
    grid-auto-rows: 50px;
    grid-auto-columns: 50px;
}
img {grid-row: auto; grid-column: auto;}
```

<figure class="bordernone width-50">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1139"><span class="label">Figure 12-47.
</span>Flowing images in grids</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that some of the images []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797043865040
primary="grid layout" secondary="overlapping elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797043864064
primary="overlapping elements" secondary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}overlap others? That's because each image is
attached to the next grid line in the flow, without taking into account
the presence of other grid items. We didn't set up images to span more
than one grid track when they needed it, so overlap occurred.

This can be managed with class names or other identifiers. We could
class images as `tall` or `wide` (or both) and specify that they get
more grid tracks. Here's some CSS to add to the previous example, with
the result shown in
[Figure 12-48](#ch12.xhtml_giving_images_more_track_space){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.wide {grid-column: auto / span 2;}
img.tall {grid-row: auto / span 2;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_giving_images_more_track_space" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1140"><span class="label">Figure 12-48.
</span>Giving images more track space</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This does cause the images to keep spilling down the page, but no
overlapping occurs.

However, notice the gaps in this grid? That happens because the
placement of some grid items across grid lines doesn't leave enough room
for other items in the flow. To illustrate this, and the two flow
patterns, more clearly, let's try an example with numbered boxes
([Figure 12-49](#ch12.xhtml_illustrating_flow_patterns){data-type="xref"}).

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_illustrating_flow_patterns" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1249.png" width="600" height="325"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1141"><span class="label">Figure 12-49.
</span>Illustrating flow patterns</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Follow across the rows of the first grid, counting along with the
numbers. In this particular flow, the grid items are laid out almost as
if they were leftward floats. Almost, but not quite: notice that grid
item 13 is actually to the left of grid item 11. That would never happen
with floats, but it can with grid flow. The way row flow (if we may call
it that) works is that you go across each row from left to right, and if
there's room for a grid item, you put it there. If a grid cell has been
occupied by another grid item, you skip over it. So the cell next to
item 10 didn't get filled, because there wasn't room for item 11. Item
13 went to the left of item 11 because there was room for it there when
the row was reached.

As shown by the second example in
[Figure 12-49](#ch12.xhtml_illustrating_flow_patterns){data-type="xref"},
the same basic mechanisms hold true for column flow, except in this case
you work from top to bottom. Thus, the cell below item 9 is empty
because item 10 wouldn't fit there. Instead, item 10 went into the next
column and covered four grid cells (two in each direction). The items
after it, since they were just one grid cell in size, filled in the
cells after it in column order.

Grid flow []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797043775440

data-type="indexterm"}works left to right, top to bottom in languages
that have that writing pattern. In RTL languages, such as Arabic and
Hebrew, the row-oriented flow would be right to left, not left to right.
:::

If you were just now wishing for a way to pack grid items as densely as
possible, regardless of how that affected the ordering, good news: you
can! Just add the keyword `dense` to your `grid-auto-flow` value, and
that's exactly what will happen. We can see the result in
[Figure 12-50](#ch12.xhtml_illustrating_dense_flow_patterns){data-type="xref"},
which shows the results of `grid-auto-flow: row dense` and
`grid-auto-flow: dense column` side by side.

<figure class="bordernone">

</figure>

In the first grid, item 12 appears in the row above item 11 because
there was a [cell that]{.keep-together} fit it. For the same reason,
item 11 appears to the left of item 10 in the second grid.

In effect, what happens with `dense` grid flow is that for each grid
item, the browser scans through the *entire* grid in the given flow
direction (`row` or `column`), starting from the flow's starting point
(the top-left corner in LTR languages), until it finds a place where
that grid item will fit. This can make things like photo galleries more
compact, and works great as long as you don't have a specific order in
which the grid items need to appear.

Now that we've explored grid flow, we have a confession to make: to make
the last couple of grid items look right, we included some CSS that we
didn't show you. Without it, the items hanging off the edge of the grid
would have looked quite a bit different from the other items---much
shorter in row-oriented flow, and much narrower in column-oriented flow.
You'll see why, and the CSS we used, in the next
section.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797043765152 primary=""

So far, we've []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_track_auto primary="grid layout"
secondary="grid tracks" tertiary="automatic"
data-type="indexterm"}almost entirely seen grid items placed into a grid
that was explicitly defined. []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_implicit_grid2

primary="grid layout" secondary="implicit grid"
data-type="indexterm"}But in the preceding section we had grid items
running off the edge of the explicitly defined grid. What happens when a
grid item goes off the edge? Rows or columns are added as needed to
satisfy the layout directives of the items in question (see ["Working
with Implicit Grid"](#ch12.xhtml_the-implicit-grid){data-type="xref"}).
So, if an item with a row span of `3` is added after the end of a
row-oriented grid, three new rows are added after the explicit grid.

these automatically added grid tracks are the absolute minimum size
needed. If you want to exert a little more control over their sizing,
`grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns` are for you.

For any automatically created row or column tracks, you can provide a
single track size or a minmaxed pair of track sizes. Let's take a look
at a reduced version of the grid-flow example from the previous section:
we'll set up a 2 × 2 grid and try to put five items into it. In fact,
let's do it twice: once with `grid-auto-rows` and once without, as
illustrated in
[Figure 12-51](#ch12.xhtml_grids_auto-row_sizing){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 80px 80px;
    grid-template-columns: 80px 80px;}
#g1 {grid-auto-rows: 80px;}
```

As the second grid shows, without assigning a size to the automatically
created row, the overflowing grid items are placed in a row that's
exactly as tall as the grid items' content, and not a pixel more. Each
is still just as wide as the column into which it's placed, because the
columns have a size (`80px`). The row, lacking an explicit height,
defaults to `auto`, with the result shown.

</div>
</figure>

If we flip things to a column-oriented flow, the same basic principles
apply (see
[Figure 12-52](#ch12.xhtml_grids_auto-column_sizing){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.grid {display: grid; grid-auto-flow: column;
    grid-template-rows: 80px 80px;
    grid-template-columns: 80px 80px;}
#g1 {grid-auto-columns: 80px;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_grids_auto-column_sizing" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1147"><span class="label">Figure 12-52.
</span>Grids with and without auto-column sizing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this case, because the flow is column oriented, the last grid items
are placed into a new column past the end of the explicit grid. In the
second grid, where there's no `grid-auto-columns`, those fifth and sixth
items are each as tall as their rows (`80px`), but have an `auto` width,
so they're just as wide as they need to be, and no wider.

Now you know what we used in the `grid-auto-flow` figures in the
previous section: we silently made the auto-rows and auto-columns the
same size as the explicitly sized columns, in order to not have the last
few grid items look weird. Let's bring back one of those figures, only
this time the `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-columns` styles will be
removed. As shown in
[Figure 12-53](#ch12.xhtml_auto-track_sizing_removed){data-type="xref"},
the last few items in each grid are shorter or narrower than the rest,
because of the lack of auto-track

```
The syntax is a little bit migraine-inducing, yes, but we'll step
through it a piece at a time.

Let's get to the elephant in the room right away: `grid` allows you to
either define a grid template *or* to set the grid's flow and auto-track
sizing in a compact syntax. You can't do both at the same time.

Furthermore, whichever you don't define is reset to its defaults, as is
normal for a shorthand property. So if you define the grid template, the
flow and auto tracks will be returned to their default values.

Now let's talk about creating a grid template by using `grid`. The
values can get fiendishly complex and take on some fascinating patterns,
but can be very handy in some situations. As an example, the following
rule is equivalent to the set of rules that follows it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid:
    "header header header header" 3em
    ". content sidebar ." 1fr
    "footer footer footer footer" 5em /
    2em 3fr minmax(10em,1fr) 2em;

/* the following together say the same thing as above */
grid-template-areas:
    "header header header header"
    ". content sidebar ."
    "footer footer footer footer";
grid-template-rows: 3em 1fr 5em;
grid-template-columns: 2em 3fr minmax(10em,1fr) 2em;
```

Notice how the value of `grid-template-rows` is broken up and scattered
around the strings of `grid-template-areas`. That's how row sizing is
handled in `grid` when you have grid-area strings present. Take those
strings out, and you end up with the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid:
     3em 1fr 5em / 2em 3fr minmax(10em,1fr) 2em;
```

In other words, the row tracks are separated by a forward slash (`/`)
from the column tracks.

Remember that with `grid`, undeclared shorthands are reset to their
defaults. That means the following two rules are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#layout {display: grid;
    grid: 3em 1fr 5em / 2em 3fr minmax(10em,1fr) 2em;}

#layout {display: grid;
    grid: 3em 1fr 5em / 2em 3fr minmax(10em,1fr) 2em;
    grid-auto-rows: auto;
    grid-auto-columns: auto;
    grid-auto-flow: row;}
```

Therefore, make sure your `grid` declaration comes before anything else
related to defining the grid. If we want a dense column flow, we'd write
something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#layout {display: grid;
    grid: 3em 1fr 5em / 2em 3fr minmax(10em,1fr) 2em;
    grid-auto-flow: dense column;}
```

Now, let's bring the named grid areas back, *and* add some extra row
grid-line names to the mix. A named grid line that goes *above* a row
track is written *before* the string, and a grid line that goes *below*
the row track comes *after* the string and any track sizing. So let's
say we want to add `main-start` and `main-stop` above and below the
middle row, and `page-end` at the very bottom:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid:
    "header header header header" 3em
    [main-start] ". content sidebar ." 1fr [main-stop]
    "footer footer footer footer" 5em [page-end] /
    2em 3fr minmax(10em,1fr) 2em;
```

That creates the grid shown in
[Figure 12-54](#ch12.xhtml_creating_grid_w_grid){data-type="xref"}, with
the implicitly created named grid lines (e.g., `footer-start`), along
with the explicitly named grid lines we wrote into the CSS.

</div>
</figure>

You can see how `grid` values can get very complicated very quickly.
It's a powerful syntax, and it's surprisingly easy to get used to once
you've had just a bit of practice. On the other hand, it's also
incredibly easy to get things wrong and have the entire value be
invalid, thus preventing the appearance of any grid at all.

For the other use of `grid`, it's a merging of `grid-auto-flow`,
`grid-auto-rows`, and `grid-auto-columns`. The following rules are
equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#layout {grid-auto-flow: dense rows;
    grid-auto-rows: 2em;
    grid-auto-columns: minmax(1em,3em);}

#layout {grid: dense rows 2em / minmax(1em,3em);}
```

That's certainly a lot less typing for the same result! But once again,
we have to remind you: if you write this, all the column and row track
properties will be set to their defaults. Thus, the following rules are
equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#layout {grid: dense rows 2em / minmax(1em,3em);}

#layout {grid: dense rows 2em / minmax(1em,3em);
	grid-template-rows: auto;
	grid-template-columns: auto;}
```

So once again, it's important to make sure your shorthand comes before
any properties it might otherwise
override.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797043147584 primary=""
startref="ix_grid_shorthand"

# Using Subgrids {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1152}

We promised many, many pages ago to talk []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_subgrid
primary="grid layout" secondary="subgrids" data-type="indexterm"}about
`subgrid`, and at last the time has come. The basic summary is that
*subgrids* are grids that use the grid tracks of an ancestor grid to
align their grid items, instead of a pattern unique to themselves. A
crude example is setting a number of columns on the `<body>` element,
and then having all of the layout components use that grid, no matter
how far down they are in the markup.

Let's see how that works. We'll start with a simple markup structure
like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<body>
  <header class="site">
     <h1>ConHugeCo</h1>
     <nav>…</nav>
  </header>
  <main>
     …
  </main>
  <footer class="site">
     <img src="…" class="logo">
     <nav>…</nav>
     <div>…</div>
  </footer>
</body>
```

A real home page would have a lot more elements, but we're keeping this
brief for clarity's sake.

First, we add the following CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(15,1fr);}
```

At this point, the body has 15 columns, each equally sized thanks to the
`1fr` value. Those columns are separated by 14 gutters, each 1% the
width of the viewport. (These are almost certainly desktop styles and
not intended for mobile devices.)

At the moment, the three children of the `<body>` element are trying to
jam themselves into the first 3 of those 15 columns. We don't want that:
we want them to span the width of the layout. Well, we want the header
and footer to do that. The `<main>` element should actually stand away
from the edges of the viewport by, say, one column on each side.

So we add the following CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:is(header, footer).site {grid-column: 1 / -1;}
main {grid-column: 2 / -2;}
```

What we have so far is illustrated in
[Figure 12-55](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_simple_setup){data-type="xref"}, with
dashed lines added to represent the grid-column tracks set for the
`<body>` element, and some extra content that wasn't present in the
initial markup code. (You'll see it in more detail soon.)

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_subgrid_simple_setup" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1255.png" width="600" height="178"

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1153"><span class="label">Figure 12-55.
</span>The initial setup of a page layout</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This might look like an entirely pointless exercise in defining and then
ignoring a bunch of grid columns, but just wait. It's about to get good.

Let's take a closer look at the site header. Here's its full markup
structure, minus the link URLs:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<header class="site">
  <h1>ConHugeCo Industries</h1>
  <nav>
     <a href="…">Home</a>
     <a href="…">Mission</a>
     <a href="…">Products</a>
     <a href="…">Services</a>
     <a href="…">Support</a>
     <a href="…">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

Again, a real site would probably have a bit more to it, but this is
enough to get the point across. What we're going to do now is turn the
`<header>` element into a grid container that uses the `<body>`
element's grid tracks for itself:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header.site {display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid;}
header.site h1 {grid-column: 2 / span 5;}
header.site nav {grid-column: span 7 / -2;
     align-self: center; text-align: end;}
```

In the first rule, we make the element into a grid container with
`display: grid` and then says its column template is a `subgrid`. At
this point, the browser looks up through the markup tree to the closest
grid container and uses the `grid-template-columns` of that ancestor (in
this case, the `<body>`). But this isn't just a copy of the value. The
`<header>` element is literally using the body's grid tracks for its
column-oriented layout.

Thus, when the second rule says the `<h1>` should start on column line 2
and span five column tracks, it starts on the body's second column line
and spans five of the body's column lines. Similarly, the `<nav>`
element is set to span seven tracks back from the second-to-last column
line of the `<body>`.
[Figure 12-56](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_header){data-type="xref"} shows the
results, along with the self-alignment and text alignment of the `<nav>`
element and some shaded backgrounds to clearly indicate where the
header's pieces are being gridded.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_subgrid_header" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1256.png" width="600" height="168"
alt="css5 1256" />
<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1154"><span class="label">Figure 12-56.
</span>Placing the <code>header</code>’s pieces on the
<code>body</code>’s columns</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the pieces inside the header line up perfectly with the
edges of the `<main>` element. That's because they're all being placed
on the exact same grid lines. Not separate grid lines that just happen
to coincide, but the actual grid lines. This means that if, for example,
the `<body>` element's column template is changed to add a couple more
columns, or to resize some of the columns to be wider or narrower, we
just edit the `grid-template-columns` value for the `<body>`, and
everything using those column lines will move along with the lines.

We can do similar things with the footer. Take this CSS, for example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
footer.site {display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid;}
footer.site img {grid-column: 5;}
footer.site nav {grid-column: 9 / -4; }
footer.site div {grid-column: span 2 / -1;}
```

Now the logo in the footer is placed right alongside the fifth column
line, the `<nav>` starts from the column line at the center of the
layout and spans over a few tracks, and the `<div>` containing the legal
bits ends at the very last column line and spans back two tracks.
[Figure 12-57](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_footer){data-type="xref"} shows the
result.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_subgrid_footer" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1257.png" width="600" height="132"

</span>Placing the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>’s pieces on the
<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>’s columns</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Looking at it, maybe we'd prefer the legal stuff to be underneath the
navlinks. The usual solution in cases like this is to wrap the navlinks
and legalese into a container such as a `<div>`, and then place that
container on the grid columns. But thanks to how `subgrid` works, this
isn't at all necessary!

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797042632640
primary="subgrids" secondary="explicit tracks"
data-type="indexterm"}grid-like solution to the problem of placing
footer pieces below others is to put them on their own rows. So let's do
that:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
footer.site {display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid;
     grid-template-rows: repeat(2,auto);}
footer.site img {grid-column: 5; grid-row: 1 / -1;}
footer.site nav {grid-column: 9 / -2; }
footer.site div {grid-column: span 7 / -2; grid-row: 2;}
```

This code has only three new things as compared to the last time we
looked at it. First, the `<footer>` itself is given a
`grid-template-rows` value. Second, the logo image is set to span the
two rows defined in the first rule. Third, the `grid-column` value of
the `<div>` is changed so it spans the same column tracks the `<nav>`
does. It's just expressed differently. The `<div>` is also set to an
explicit grid row.

So while the `<footer>` continues to subgrid the column template of the
`body` element, it also defines its own private row template. Just two
rows, in this case, but that's all we need.
[Figure 12-58](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_footer_own_rows){data-type="xref"}
shows the result, with a dashed line added to show the boundary between
the `<footer>`'s two rows.

## Dealing with Offsets {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1158}

Let's turn []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_subgrid_offset primary="subgrids"
secondary="offsets"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_offset_subgrid primary="offsets"
secondary="subgrids" data-type="indexterm"}to the `<main>` element in
this document, which contains this basic markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<main>
     <div class="gallery">
          <div>
               <img src="…" alt="">
               <h2>Title</h2>
               <p>Some descriptive text</p>
          </div>
     </div>
</main>
```

As you saw previously, the `<main>` element is placed on the `<body>`'s
grid as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {grid-column: 2 / -2;}
```

This causes it to stretch from the `<body>`'s second grid column line to
the second-to-last grid column line. This pushes its sides inward by one
column on either side.

The contents within the `<main>` element are not participating in the
`<body>` grid, because `<main>` isn't a subgrid. Well, not yet. Let's
fix that by changing the rule to the following, with the result shown in
[Figure 12-59](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_main_placement){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_subgrid_main_placement" class="figure">

</span>Placing the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element’s children on the
<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>’s grid</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Again, this element is a subgrid of the body's subgrid, but this time it
isn't stretched from one edge of the grid to the other. The gallery
`<div>` is taking up only one column, because it's a grid item that
hasn't been assigned any grid column values.

So here's the question: what if we want move it one column track away
from the edge of the `<main>` element? That's the third column line of
the `<body>`, but the second inside the `<main>` element's container.
Should it be `grid-column: 3` or `grid-column: 2`?

The answer is `2`. When counting grid lines within a subgrid, you
account for only those grid lines inside it. Thus, the following would
have the result shown in
[Figure 12-60](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_main_column_count){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {grid-column: 2 / -2;}
```

Now the gallery fills all but the start and end columns within the
`<main>`'s container, by starting at the second grid line within the
`<main>` and ending at the second-to-last grid line. If we were to
change the value to `3 / -3`, the gallery would stretch from the third
column line with the `<main>` to the third-last, thus leaving two empty
columns to either side. But let's not do that.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_subgrid_main_column_count" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1260.png" width="600" height="195"

</span>Placing the gallery inward by a column on each side, and spanning
<span class="keep-together">several columns</span></h6>
</div>
</figure>

Instead, let's now suppose we add five more cards to the gallery, for a
total of six, and we'll add some filler text rather than have each one
just titled "Title" and so on. If we do that and don't change any of the
CSS, we'll just have six `<div>`s stacked on top of each other, because
while the gallery is stretched across the `<main>`'s subgrid, it isn't a
subgrid (or even a not-subgrid), so its interior is a normal-flow
environment.

We can fix that with---yes---more subgridding!

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {grid-column: 2 / -2; display: grid; grid-template-columns: subgrid;}
```

Now the gallery is a subgrid of its nearest ancestor element that
defines a not-subgridded column template, which is the `<body>` element,
and thus the cards within the gallery will use the column template of
the `<body>`. We want them to fill out the gallery, which has 12 tracks
within it, so we'll have them each span 2 tracks, with the results shown
in [Figure 12-61](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_gallery_cards){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery > div {grid-column: span 2; padding: 0.5em;
     border: 1px solid; background: #FFF8;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_subgrid_gallery_cards" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1261.png" width="600" height="237"

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1161"><span class="label">Figure 12-61.
</span>Adding multiple cards to the subgridded gallery</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Not bad, but it could be better. That last card has a longer title, and
it's wrapped to two lines. That means all the descriptive text
paragraphs don't line up with one another. How do we fix that? The same
way we did for the footer: by defining a row template for the gallery,
and making the cards subgrid to that row template!

We start by defining the row template with some named lines and track
sizes:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: subgrid;
	grid-template-rows: [pic] max-content [title] max-content [desc] auto;
     grid-column: 2 / -2;}
```

Now, each card needs to span the row template so that the row lines will
be available to it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery > div {grid-column: span 2;
     grid-row: 1 / -1;}
```

Now that the cards span from the gallery's first row line to its last,
we're ready to have the cards become grid containers with a single
column and a subgrid of the gallery's row [template:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery > div {grid-column: span 2;
     grid-row: 1 / -1;
     display: grid;
     grid-template-rows: subgrid;
     grid-template-columns: 1fr;}
```

We didn't really need to add the `grid-template-columns` declaration,
because it would default to a single column, but sometimes it's nice to
explicitly say what it is you want to happen, so anyone responsible for
the CSS after you write it (including you in six months) doesn't have to
guess at what you meant to do.

At the moment, the elements inside each card will automatically fall
into the row tracks: the images into the `pic` track, the titles into
the `title` track, and the paragraphs into the `desc` track. But since
we're trying to be self-documenting, let's explicitly assign each
element to its named track, and while we're at it, vertically align the
titles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery > div img {grid-row: pic;}
.gallery > div h2 {grid-row: title; align-self: center;}
.gallery > div p {grid-row: desc;}
```

[Figure 12-62](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_gallery_card_rows){data-type="xref"}
shows the final result, with the titles vertically centered with respect
to one another, the descriptive paragraphs all lined up along their top
edges, and all the cards sharing the same height.

A big advantage here is that with the pieces of the cards explicitly
assigned to the named grid row lines, rearranging the cards is now
merely a question of editing the `grid-row-template` value set on the
gallery.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_subgrid_gallery_card_rows" class="figure">

</span>Placing card items on subgridded rows</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We could also have made the cards' column template a subgrid, which
would have meant they'd use the `<body>` element's column template,
because the body is the nearest ancestor element with a column template
that isn't a subgrid. In that case, the cards would use the gallery's
row template and the body's column template. And they'd all influence
the sizing of those ancestors' grid tracks, and thus influence the
layout of everything else that uses those same templates.

If you have more cards than will fit into a single row, you'll run into
a problem: subgrids do *not* create implicit grid tracks. Instead, you
need to use the auto-track properties like `grid-auto-rows`, which will
add as many rows as needed.

Thus, we'll need to remove the line names and rework the CSS we've built
to read as [follows:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: subgrid;
	grid-auto-rows: max-content max-content auto;
	/* was: [pic] max-content [title] max-content [desc] auto */
     grid-column: 2 / -2;}
.gallery > div {grid-column: span 2;
     grid-row: 1 / -1;
     display: grid;
     grid-template-rows: subgrid;
     grid-template-columns: 1fr;}
```

The problem now is that we have the picture, title, and description text
each assigned to a named grid line, but `grid-auto-rows` doesn't allow
line names. It might look like we have to change the grid row
assignments, but that's not the case, as you're about to
see.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797042041648 primary=""
startref="ix_offset_subgrid"

## Naming Subgridded Lines {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1163}

In addition to using the []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_subgrid_name_line
primary="subgrids" secondary="naming lines" data-type="indexterm"}names
of any grid lines in the ancestor template, you can assign names to the
subgrid, which is a real help if you're using auto-tracks like those
created in the previous section.

In this case, since we used to have row lines named `pic`, `title`, and
`desc` in the parent grid but had to remove them in order to set up
auto-rows, we take those same labels and put them after the `subgrid`
keyword for `grid-template-rows`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
grid-template-rows: subgrid [pic] [title] [desc];
```

Here's what that looks like in context with the rest of the CSS for
these cards, which are laid out as shown in
[Figure 12-63](#ch12.xhtml_gallery-cards-rows-repeat){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.gallery {display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: subgrid;

</span>Placing cards onto auto-rows with named lines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

It's also possible to assign names to just a few lines while not naming
the rest. To see this in action, let's add a couple of paragraphs of
text below the gallery, something like this (with ellipsis-enclosed text
in place of the actual content):

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<main>
	<div class="gallery">
		…cards here…
	</div>
	<p class="leadin">…text…</p>
	<p class="explore">…text…</p>
</main>
```

To span the paragraphs across various column tracks, we could count and
use numbers, but let's name some lines and use those instead. In this
case, since these paragraphs are children of the `<main>` element, we'll
need to modify its subgridded column template. Here's how we'll do it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {grid-column: 2 / -2;
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns:
          subgrid [] [leadin-start] repeat(5, [])
          [leadin-end explore-start] repeat(5, [])
          [explore-end];
     }
```

OK, whoa. What just happened?

Here's how it breaks down: after the `subgrid` keyword, we have a bunch
of name assignments. The first is just `[]`, which means "don't add a
name to this grid line." Then we have `[leadin-start]`, which assigns
the name `leadin-start` to the second grid column line in the subgrid.
After that is a repetition that means the next five grid column lines
get no subgrid name assigned.

Next up is what happens to be the line running down the middle of the
grid, which is given both the name `leadin-end` and `explore-start`.
This means the lead-in paragraph should stop spanning at this line, and
the explore paragraph should start spanning at the same line. After
another five no-name-assigned lines, we assign `explore-end` to a line,
and that's it. Any lines that weren't addressed will be left alone.

Now all we have to do is set the paragraphs' start and end column lines
like so, and get the result shown in
[Figure 12-64](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_main_named_lines){data-type="xref"},
where the two cards on the second line of cards have been removed for
clarity:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.leadin  {grid-column: leadin-start /  leadin-end;}
p.explore {grid-column: explore-start / explore-end;}
```

And there they are, using their custom-named start and end grid lines to
span across many grid tracks. As promised, the first ends where the
second starts, right on that grid line that happens to be in the middle
of the layout.

Having the cards jam right up next to each other doesn't look great,
though. We could push the actual text apart by using padding on the
paragraphs, but some gaps would be nice, wouldn't
they?[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797041594432 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_gaps_subgrid primary="gaps"

separate from any gaps on their ancestor grids. Thus, for example, we
could extend our previous example like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main {grid-column: 2 / -2;
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns:
          subgrid [] [leadin-start] repeat(5, [])

          [explore-end];
     gap: 0 2em;
     }
```

With this change, the `<main>` element is setting no row gaps but 2-em
column gaps. This has the result shown in
[Figure 12-65](#ch12.xhtml_subgrid_grid_gaps){data-type="xref"}.

Notice that not only are the two paragraphs pushed apart, but so are the
cards in the gallery. That's because they're all participating in the
same subgrid, and that subgrid just had some gaps added to it. This
means the sides of the cards and the side of the paragraphs are still
lined up precisely with each other, which is pretty nice.

Note also that these gaps don't apply to the content in ancestor grids:
the boxes in the header and footer still come right up to the center
column line. It's only the elements in the `<main>` element's subgrid,
and any subgrids of that subgrid, that will know about and make use of
these gaps.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797041472704 primary=""

items to the grid, create gutters between the grid tracks, and even use
the track templates of ancestor elements. But what happens if we style a
grid item with, say, margins? Or if it's absolutely positioned? How do
these things interact with the grid lines?

Let's take []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_margins_grid primary="margins"
secondary="grid layout"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_margins
primary="grid layout" secondary="margins and grid"
data-type="indexterm"}margins first. The basic principle at work is that
an element is attached to the grid by its margin edges. That means you
can push the visible parts of the element inward from the grid area it
occupies by setting positive margins---and pull it outward with negative
margins. For example, these styles will have the result shown in
[Figure 12-66](#ch12.xhtml_grid_items_with_margins){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#grid {display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 100px);
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 200px);}
.box02 {margin: 25px;}
.box03 {margin: -25px 0;}
```

<div id="ch12.xhtml_grid_items_with_margins" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1170"><span class="label">Figure 12-66.
</span>Grid items with margins</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This works as it does because the items have both their `width` and
`height` set to `auto`, so they can be stretched as needed to make
everything work out. If `width` and/or `height` have non-`auto` values,
they'll end up overriding margins to make all the math work out. This is
much like what happens with inline margins when element sizing is
overconstrained: eventually, one of the margins gets overridden.

Consider an element with the following styles placed into a
200-pixel-wide by 100-pixel-tall grid area:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.exel {width: 150px; height: 100px;
    padding: 0; border: 0;
    margin: 10px;}
```

Going across the element first, it has 10 pixels of margin to either
side, and its `width` is `150px`, giving a total of 170 pixels.
Something's gotta give, and in this case it's the right margin (in LTR
languages), which is changed to `40px` to make everything work---10
pixels on the left margin, 150 pixels on the content box, and 40 pixels
on the right margin equals the 200 pixels of the grid area's width.

On the vertical axis, the bottom margin is reset to `-10px`. This
compensates for the top margin and content height totaling 110 pixels,
when the grid area is only 100 pixels tall.

::: {.less_space .pagebreak-before .note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1171}

Margins on grid items are ignored when calculating grid-track sizes.
Therefore, no matter how big or small you make a grid item's margins, it
won't change the sizing of a `min-content` column, for example, nor will
increasing the margins on a grid item cause `fr`-sized grid tracks to
change size.
:::

As with block layout, you can selectively use `auto` margins to decide
which margin will have its value changed to fit. Suppose we wanted the
grid item to align to the right of its grid area. By setting the item's
left margin to `auto`, that would happen:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.exel {width: 150px; height: 100px;
    padding: 0; border: 0;
    margin: 10px; margin-left: auto;}
```

Now the element will add up 160 pixels for the right margin and content
box, and then give the difference between that and the grid area's width
to the left margin, since it's been explicitly set to `auto`. This
results in
[Figure 12-67](#ch12.xhtml_using_auto_margins_to_align_items){data-type="xref"},
with 10 pixels of margin on each side of the `exel` item, except the
left margin, which is (as we just calculated) 40 pixels.

That alignment process might seem familiar from block-level layout,
where you can use `auto` inline margins to center an element in its
containing block, as long as you've given it an explicit `width`. Grid
layout differs in that you can do the same thing on the vertical axis;
that is, given an element with an absolute height, you can vertically
center it by setting the top and bottom margins to `auto`.
[Figure 12-68](#ch12.xhtml_various_auto-margin_alignments){data-type="xref"}
shows a variety of `auto` margin effects on images, which inherently
have explicit heights and widths:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.i01 {margin: 10px;}
.i02 {margin: 10px; margin-left: auto;}
.i03 {margin: auto 10px auto auto;}

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1174}

CSS has other ways to align grid items, notably with properties like
`justify-self`, which don't depend on having explicit element sizes or
auto margins. These are covered in the next section.
:::

This auto-margin behavior is a lot like the way margins and element
sizes operate when elements are absolutely positioned---which leads us
to the next question: what if a grid item is *also* absolutely
positioned? For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.exel {grid-row: 2 / 4; grid-column: 2 / 5;
    position: absolute;
    top: 1em; bottom: 15%;
    left: 35px; right: 1rem;}
```

The answer is actually pretty elegant: if you've defined grid-line
starts and ends *and* the grid container establishes a positioning
content (e.g., using `position: relative`), that grid area is used as
the containing block and positioning context for the grid, and so the
grid item is positioned *within* that context. That means the offset
properties (`top` et al.) are calculated in relation to the declared
grid area. Thus, the previous CSS would have the result shown in
[Figure 12-69](#ch12.xhtml_absolutely_positioning_a_grid_item){data-type="xref"},
with the lightly shaded area denoting grid area used as the positioning
context, and the thick-bordered box denoting the absolutely positioned
[grid item.]{.keep-together}

<figure class="bordernone">

</span>Absolutely positioning a grid item</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Everything you know about absolutely positioned elements regarding
offsets, margins, element sizing, and so on applies within this
formatting context. It's just that in this case, the formatting context
is defined by a grid area.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797041115136 primary=""
startref="ix_grid_margins"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797041114288 primary=""

[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797041113280 primary="grid layout"
secondary="absolute positioning"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797041112304
primary="absolute positioning" secondary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}positioning introduces a wrinkle: it changes the
behavior of the `auto` value for grid-line properties. If, for example,
you set `grid-column-end: auto` for an absolutely positioned grid item,
the ending grid line will actually create a new and special grid line
that corresponds to the padding edge of the grid container itself. This
is true even if the explicit grid is smaller than the grid container, as
can happen. To see this in action, we'll modify the previous example as
follows, with the result shown in
[Figure 12-70](#ch12.xhtml_auto_values_and_absolute_positioning){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.exel {grid-row: 2 / auto; grid-column: 2 / auto;
    position: absolute;
    top: 1em; bottom: 15%;
    left: 35px; right: 1rem;}
```

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_auto_values_and_absolute_positioning"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1270.png" width="600" height="400"

<h6 id="ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1176"><span class="label">Figure 12-70.
</span>Auto values and absolute positioning</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice how the positioning context now starts at the top of the grid
container (the thin black line around the outside of the figure), and
stretches all the way to the right edge of the grid container, even
though the grid itself ends short of that edge.

One implication of this behavior is that if you absolutely position an
element that's a grid item, but you don't give it any grid-line start or
end values, then it will use the inner padding edge of the grid
container as its positioning context. It does this without having to set
the grid container to `position: relative`, or any of the other usual
tricks to establish a positioning context.

Also note that absolutely positioned grid items do *not* participate in
figuring out grid cell and track sizing. As far as the grid layout is
concerned, the positioned grid item doesn't exist. Once the grid is set
up, the grid item is positioned with respect to the grid lines that
define its positioning context.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797041062256

Those same properties are also available in grid layout and have very

First, a quick []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_inline_format_box_mod

As [Table 12-1](#ch12.xhtml_grid_layout_properties){data-type="xref"}
shows, the various `justify-*` properties change alignment along the
inline axis---in English, this will be the horizontal direction. The
difference is whether a property applies to a single grid item, all the
grid items in a grid, or the entire grid. Similarly, the `align-*`
properties affect alignment along the block axis; in English, this is
the vertical direction. The `place-*` properties, on the other hand, are
shorthands that apply in both the block and inline directions.

## Aligning and Justifying Individual Items {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1178}

It's easiest to []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_justified_grid_items
primary="justified items, grid layout" data-type="indexterm"}start with
the `*-self` properties, because we can have one grid show various
`justify-self` property values, []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040996912

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040996176
primary="align-self property" data-type="indexterm"}while a second grid
shows the effects of those same values when used by `align-self`. (See
[Figure 12-71](#ch12.xhtml_self_alignment_in_the_inline_and_block_directions){data-type="xref"}.)

</figure>

Each grid item in
[Figure 12-71](#ch12.xhtml_self_alignment_in_the_inline_and_block_directions){data-type="xref"}
is shown with its grid area (the dashed line) and a label identifying
the property value that's applied to it. Each deserves a bit of
[commentary.]{.keep-together}

First, though, realize that for all of these values, any element that
doesn't have an explicit `width` or `height` will "shrink-wrap" its
content, instead of using the default grid-item behavior of filling out
the entire grid area.

The `start` and `end` values cause the grid item to be aligned to the
start or end edge of its grid area, which makes sense. Similarly,
`center` centers the grid item within its area along the alignment axis,
*without* the need to declare margins or any other properties, including
`height` and `width`.

The `left` and `right` values cause the item to be aligned to the left
or right edge of the grid area when the inline axis is horizontal, as
shown in
[Figure 12-71](#ch12.xhtml_self_alignment_in_the_inline_and_block_directions){data-type="xref"}.
If the inline axis is vertical, as in `writing-mode: vertical-rl`, items
are aligned along the inline axis as if the inline axis were still
horizontal; thus, in a top-to-bottom inline axis, `left` will align to
the top of the grid area []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040981968
primary="direction property" data-type="indexterm"}when `direction` is
`ltr`, and to its bottom when `direction` is `rtl`. When applied to
`align-self`, `left` and `right` are treated as if they were `stretch`.

The `self-start` and `self-end` values are more interesting. The
`self-start` option aligns a grid item with the grid-area edge that
corresponds to the grid *item's* start edge. So in
[Figure 12-71](#ch12.xhtml_self_alignment_in_the_inline_and_block_directions){data-type="xref"},
the `self-start` and `self-end` boxes are set to `direction: rtl`. That
sets them to use RTL language direction, meaning their start edges are
their right edges, and their end edges their left. You can see in the
first grid this right-aligned `self-start` and left-aligned `self-end`.
In the second grid, however, the RTL direction is irrelevant to
block-axis alignment. Thus, `self-start` is treated as `start`, and
`self-end` is treated [as `end`.]{.keep-together}

The last value, `stretch`, is also interesting. To understand it, notice
how the other boxes in each grid "shrink-wrap" themselves to their
content, as if set to `max-content`. The `stretch` value, by contrast,
directs the element to stretch from edge to edge in the given
direction---`align-self: stretch` causes the grid item to stretch along
the block axis, and `justify-self: stretch` causes inline-axis
stretching. This is as you might expect, but bear in mind that it works
only if the element's size properties are set to `auto`. Thus, given the
following styles, the first example will stretch vertically, but the
second will not:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.exel01 {align-self: stretch; block-size: auto;}
.exel02 {align-self: stretch; block-size: 50%;}
```

Because the second example sets a `block-size` value that isn't `auto`
(which is the default value), that grid item cannot be resized by
`stretch`. The same holds true for `justify-self` and `inline-size`.

Two more values that can be used to align grid items are sufficiently
interesting to merit their own explanation. These permit the alignment
of a grid item's first or last baseline with the highest or lowest
baseline in the grid track. For example, suppose you want a grid item to
be aligned so the baseline of its last line is aligned with the last
baseline in the tallest grid item sharing its row track. That would look
like the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.exel {align-self: last-baseline;}
```

Conversely, to align its first baseline with the lowest first baseline
in the same row track, you'd say this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.exel {align-self: baseline;}
```

If a grid element doesn't have a baseline, or it's asked to
baseline-align itself in a direction where baselines can't be compared,
`baseline` is treated as `start`, and `last-baseline` is treated as
`end`.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040896000 primary=""

###### Note {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1180}

This section intentionally skips two values: `flex-start` and
`flex-end`. These values are supposed to be used only in flexbox layout,
and are defined to be equivalent to `start` and `end` in any other
layout context, including grid layout.

Supplying one value for `place-self` means it's copied to the second
value as well. Thus, in each of the following pairs of declarations, the
first declaration is equivalent to the [second:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
place-self: end;
place-self: end end;
```

Because both of the individual properties `place-self` shorthands can
accept baseline alignment values, supplying only one value causes both
individual properties to be set to the same value. In other words, the
following are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
place-self: last baseline;
place-self: last baseline last baseline;
```

You can also supply two values, one for each of the individual
properties the shorthand represents. So the following CSS shows rules
that are equivalent to each other:

As an example, you could set all of the grid items in a grid to be
center-aligned within their grid areas as follows, with a result like
that depicted in
[Figure 12-72](#ch12.xhtml_centering_all_the_grid_items){data-type="xref"}:

As you can see, that rule horizontally *and* vertically centers every
grid item within its given grid area. Furthermore, it causes any grid
item without an explicit width and height to "shrink-wrap" its content
rather than stretch out to fill its grid area, because of the way
`center` is handled. If a grid item has an explicit inline or block
size, those are honored instead of "shrink-wrapping" the content, and
the item is still centered within its grid area.

For an overview of the effects of the various keyword values in the
context of both `justify-items` and `align-items`, see
[Figure 12-73](#ch12.xhtml_grid-alignment-justify-items-both){data-type="xref"};

The way `place-items` works is very similar to the `place-self` property
discussed previously in the chapter. If one value is given, it's applied
to both `align-items` and `justify-items`. If two values are given, the
first is applied to `align-items` and the second to `justify-items`.
Thus, the following rules are equivalent:

## Distributing Grid Items and Tracks {#ch12.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1189}

Beyond []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_grid_distr_items primary="grid layout"
secondary="distributing grid items and tracks"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040565680
primary="justify-content property" data-type="indexterm"}aligning and
justifying every grid item, it's possible to distribute the grid items,
or even to justify or align the entire grid, using `align-content` and
`justify-content`. A small set of distributive values is used for these
properties.
[Figure 12-74](#ch12.xhtml_distributing_grid_items_horizontally){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the effects of each value as applied to `justify-content`,
with each grid sharing the following styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.grid {display: grid; padding: 0.5em; margin: 0.5em 1em; inline-size: auto;
	grid-gap: 0.75em 0.5em; border: 1px solid;
	grid-template-rows: 4em;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 6em);}
```

</span>Distributing grid items along the inline axis</h6>

</figure>

In these cases, the set of []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040492304
primary="grid layout" secondary="grid lines"
tertiary="distributing tracks"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040491056
primary="grid layout" secondary="grid tracks" tertiary="distributing"
data-type="indexterm"}grid tracks is taken as a single unit, and the
items are then justified by the value of `justify-content`. That
alignment does not affect the alignment of individual grid items; thus,
you could end-justify the whole grid with `justify-content: end` while
having individual grid items be left-, center-, or start-justified
(among other options) within their grid areas.

This []{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040456288 primary="align-content property"
data-type="indexterm"}works just as well in column tracks as it does in
row tracks, as
[Figure 12-75](#ch12.xhtml_distributing_grid_items_vertically){data-type="xref"}
illustrates, as long as you switch to `align-content`. This time, the
grids all share these styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.grid {display: grid; padding: 0.5em;
	grid-gap: 0.75em 0.5em; border: 1px solid;
	grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 3em);
	grid-template-columns: 5em;}
```

</span>Distributing grid items along the block axis</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The way these distributions work is that the
[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040419392 primary="gutter space"
secondary="grid track sizing" data-type="indexterm"}grid tracks,
including any gutters, are all sized as usual. Then, if any space is
left over beyond the grid tracks and gutters---that is, if the grid
tracks don't reach all the way from one edge of the grid container to
the other---then the remaining space is distributed according to the
value of `justify-content` (in the inline axis) or `align-content` (in
the block axis).

This space distribution is carried out by resizing the grid gutters. If
no gutters are declared, they will be created. If gutters already exist,
their sizes are altered as required to distribute the grid tracks as
specified.

Note that because space is distributed only when the tracks don't fill
out the grid container, the gutters can only increase in size. If the
tracks are larger than the container, which can easily happen, there is
no leftover space to distribute (negative space turns out to be
indivisible).

One more distribution value wasn't shown in the previous figures:
`stretch`. This value takes any leftover space and applies it equally to
the grid tracks, not the gutters. So if we have 400 pixels of leftover
space and 8 grid tracks, each grid track is increased by 50 pixels. The
grid tracks are *not* increased proportionally, but equally. As of late
2022, there is no browser support for this value in terms of grid
distribution.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040415376 primary=""

primary="overlapping elements" secondary="grid items"
data-type="indexterm"}discussed in a previous section, it's entirely
possible to have grid items overlap each other, whether because negative
margins are used to pull a grid item beyond the edges of its grid area,
or because the grid areas of two different grid items share grid cells.
By default, the grid items will visually overlap in document source
order: grid items later in the document source will appear above (or "in
front of") grid items earlier in the [document]{.keep-together} source.
Thus the following results in
[Figure 12-76](#ch12.xhtml_grid_items_overlapping){data-type="xref"}
(assume the number in each class name represents the grid item's source
order):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

If you want to assert your own stacking order, `z-index` is here to
help. Just as in positioning, `z-index` places elements relative to one
another on the z-axis, which is perpendicular to the display surface.
Positive values are closer to you, and negative values further away. So
to bring the second box to the "top," as it were, all you need is to
give it a `z-index` value higher than any other (with the result shown
in [Figure 12-77](#ch12.xhtml_elevating_a_grid_item){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.box02 {z-index: 10;}

Another way you can []{#ch12.xhtml_ix_order_prop2
primary="order property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040194352
primary="flexible box (flexbox) layout" secondary="flex containers"
tertiary="ordering grid items" data-type="indexterm"}affect the ordering
of grid items is by using the `order` property. Its effect is
essentially the same as it is in flexbox---you can change the order of
grid items within a grid track by giving them `order` values. This
affects not only placement within the track, but also *paint order* if
they should overlap. For example, we could change the previous example
from `z-index` to `order`, as shown here, and get the same result shown
in [Figure 12-77](#ch12.xhtml_elevating_a_grid_item){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.box02 {order: 10;}
```

In this case, `box02` appears "on top of" the other grid items because
its order places it after the rest of them. Thus, it's drawn last.
Similarly, if those grid items were all placed in sequence in a grid
track, the `order` value for `box02` would put it at the end of the
sequence. This is depicted in
[Figure 12-78](#ch12.xhtml_changing_grid_item_order){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch12.xhtml_changing_grid_item_order" class="figure">

</span>Changing grid-item order</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Remember that just because you *can* rearrange the order of grid items
this way doesn't necessarily mean you *should*. As the [Grid Layout
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/#order-property) says:

> As with reordering flex items, the `order` property must only be used
> when the visual order needs to be *out-of-sync* with the speech and
> navigation order; otherwise the underlying document source should be
> reordered instead.

So the only reason to use `order` to rearrange grid-item layout is if
you need to have the document source in one order and layout in the
other. This is already easily possible by assigning grid items to areas
that don't match source order.

This is not to say that `order` is useless and should always be shunned;
there may well be times it makes sense. But unless you find yourself
nearly forced into using it by specific circumstances, think very hard
about whether it's the best solution.

Grid layout is complex and powerful, so don't be discouraged if you feel
overwhelmed at first. It takes some time to get used to the way grid
operates, especially because so many of its features are nothing like
what we've dealt with before. Much of those features' power comes
directly from their novelty---but like any powerful tool, grid layout
can be difficult and frustrating to learn to
use.[]{#ch12.xhtml_idm45797040118912 primary=""
startref="grid_layout_ch12" data-type="indexterm"}

We hope we were able to steer you past some of those pitfalls, but
still, remember the [wisdom]{.keep-together} of Master Yoda: "You must
unlearn what you have learned." When coming to grid layout, there has
never been greater need to put aside what you think you [know
about]{.keep-together} layout and learn anew. Over time, your patience
and persistence will be rewarded.

You []{#ch13.xhtml_ix_table_layout_ch13 primary="table layout"
data-type="indexterm"}may have glanced at this chapter's title and
wondered, "Table layout? Isn't that *so* last millennium?" Indeed so,
but this chapter is not about using tables *for* layout. Instead, it's
about the ways that tables themselves are laid out by CSS, which is a
far more complicated affair than it might first appear.

Tables are unusual, compared to the rest of document layout. Until
flexbox and grid came along, tables alone possessed the unique ability
to associate element sizes with other elements---for example, all the
cells in a row have the same height, no matter how much or how little
content each individual cell might contain. The same is true for the
widths of cells that share a column. Cells that adjoin can share a
border, even if the two cells have very different border styles. As
you'll see, these abilities are purchased at the expense of a great many
behaviors and rules---many of them rooted deep in the web's past---that
apply to tables, and only tables.

# Table Formatting {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1198}

Before we can start to worry about how cell borders are drawn and tables
sized, we need to delve into the fundamental ways in which tables are
assembled, and the ways that elements within a table are related. This
is referred to as *table formatting*, and it is quite distinct from
table layout: the layout is possible only after the formatting has been
completed.

## Visually Arranging a Table {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1199}

The []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040107392 primary="table layout"
secondary="visual arrangement" data-type="indexterm"}first thing to
understand is how CSS defines the arrangement of tables. While this
knowledge may seem basic, it's key to understanding how best to style
tables.

CSS draws a []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040105520
primary="internal table elements versus table elements"
data-type="indexterm"}distinction between *table elements* and *internal
table elements*. In CSS, internal table elements generate rectangular
boxes that have content, padding, and borders, but not margins.
Therefore, it is *not* possible to define the separation between table
cells by giving them margins. A CSS-conformant browser will ignore any
attempts to apply margins to cells, rows, or any other internal table
element (with the exception of captions, which are discussed in ["Using
Captions"](#ch13.xhtml_captions){data-type="xref"}).

CSS has []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040102128 primary="grid cells, tables"
data-type="indexterm"}six basic rules for arranging tables. The basis of
these rules is a *grid cell*, which is one area between the grid lines
on which a table is drawn. Consider the two tables in
[Figure 13-1](#ch13.xhtml_formatting-grid-cells-basis){data-type="xref"};
their grid cells are indicated by the dashed lines.

2 table, such as the lefthand table shown in
[Figure 13-1](#ch13.xhtml_formatting-grid-cells-basis){data-type="xref"},
the grid cells correspond to the actual table cells. In a more
complicated table, like the righthand table in
[Figure 13-1](#ch13.xhtml_formatting-grid-cells-basis){data-type="xref"},
some table cells will span multiple grid cells---but note that every
table cell's edges are placed along a grid-cell edge.

These grid cells are largely theoretical constructs, and they cannot be
styled or even accessed through the DOM. They just serve as a way to
describe how tables are assembled for styling.

## Table Arrangement Rules {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1201}

The []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040091680 primary="table layout"
secondary="arrangement rules"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040090672 primary="boxes"
secondary="table columns and rows"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040089728
primary="elements" secondary="table" data-type="indexterm"}six rules of
table arrangement are as follows:

-   Each *row box* encompasses[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040086992
    primary="row boxes, tables" data-type="indexterm"} a single row of
    grid cells. All the row boxes in a table fill the table from top to
    bottom in the order they occur in the source document (with the
    exception of any table-header or table-footer row boxes, which come
    at the beginning and end of the table, respectively). Thus, a table
    contains as many grid rows as there are row elements (e.g., `<tr>`
    elements).

-   A *row group*'s box encompasses[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040084368
    primary="row group boxes, tables" data-type="indexterm"} the same
    grid cells as the row boxes it contains.

-   A *column box* encompasses[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040082160
    primary="column boxes, tables" data-type="indexterm"} one or more
    columns of grid cells. All the column boxes are placed next to one
    another in the order they occur. The first column box is on the left
    for LTR languages, and on the right for RTL languages.

-   A *column group*'s box encompasses[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040080016
    primary="column group’s box" data-type="indexterm"} the same grid
    cells as the column boxes it [contains.]{.keep-together}

-   Although cells may span several rows or columns, CSS does not define
    how this happens. It is instead left to the document language to
    define spanning. Each spanned cell is a rectangular box one or more
    grid cells wide and high. The top row of this spanning rectangle is
    in the row that is the parent to the spanned grid cell. The cell's
    rectangle must be as far to the left as possible in LTR languages,
    but it may not overlap any other cell box. It must also be to the
    right of all cells in the same row that are earlier in the source
    document (in a LTR language). In RTL languages, a spanned cell must
    be as far to the *right* as possible without overlapping other
    cells, and must be to the *left* of all cells in the same row that
    follow it in the document source.

-   A cell's box *cannot* extend beyond the last row box of a table or
    row group. If the table structure would cause this condition, the
    cell must be shortened until it fits within the table or row group
    that encloses it.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1202}

The CSS specification discourages, but does not prohibit, the
positioning of table cells and other internal table elements.
Positioning a row that contains row-spanning cells, for example, could
dramatically alter the layout of the table by removing the row from the
table entirely, thus removing the spanned cells from consideration in
the layout of other rows. Nevertheless, it is quite possible to apply
positioning to table elements in current browsers.
:::

By definition, grid cells are rectangular, but they do not all have to
be the same size. All the grid cells in a given grid column will be the
same width, and all the grid cells in a grid row will be the same
height, but the height of one grid row may be different from that of
another grid row. Similarly, grid columns may be of different widths.

With those basic rules in mind, a question may arise: how, exactly, do
you know which elements are cells and which are not?

In this chapter, we'll stick to the table-related values, as the others
are beyond the scope of tables. The table-related values can be
summarized as follows:

`table`

:   Defines a []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040022336
    primary="table keyword, display" data-type="indexterm"}block-level
    table. Thus, it defines a rectangular block that generates a block
    box. The corresponding HTML element is, not surprisingly, `<table>`.

`inline-table`

:   Defines an []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040019456
    primary="inline-table keyword, display"
    data-type="indexterm"}inline-level table. This means the element
    defines a rectangular block that generates an inline box. The
    closest non-table analogue is the value `inline-block`. The closest
    HTML element is `<table>`, although, by default, HTML tables are not
    inline.

`table-row`

:   Specifies []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040016160
    primary="table-row keyword, display" data-type="indexterm"}that an
    element is a row of table cells. The corresponding HTML element is
    `<tr>`.

`table-row-group`

:   Specifies []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040013472
    primary="table-row-group keyword, display"
    data-type="indexterm"}that an element groups one or more table rows.
    The corresponding HTML value is `<tbody>`.

`table-header-group`

:   Very much []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040010784
    primary="table-header-group keyword, display"
    data-type="indexterm"}like `table-row-group`, except that for visual
    formatting, the header row group is always displayed before all
    other rows and row groups, and after any top captions. In print, if
    a table requires multiple pages to print, a user agent may repeat
    header rows at the top of each page (Firefox does this, for
    example). The specification does not define what happens if you
    assign `table-header-group` to multiple elements. A header group can
    contain multiple rows. The HTML equivalent is `<thead>`.

`table-footer-group`

:   Very much []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040007120
    primary="table-footer-group keyword, display"
    data-type="indexterm"}like `table-header-group`, except that the
    footer row group is always displayed after all other rows and row
    groups, and before any bottom captions. In print, if a table
    requires multiple pages to print, a user agent may repeat footer
    rows at the bottom of each page. The specification does not define
    what happens if you assign `table-footer-group` to multiple
    elements. This is equivalent to the HTML element `<tfoot>`.

`table-column`

:   Describes a []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797040003488
    primary="table-column keyword, display" data-type="indexterm"}column
    of table cells. In CSS terms, elements with this `display` value are
    not visually rendered, as if they had the value `none`. Their
    existence is largely for helping to define the presentation of cells
    within the column. The HTML equivalent is `<col>`.

`table-column-group`

:   Groups one or more []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039999680
    primary="table-column-group keyword, display"
    data-type="indexterm"}columns. Like `table-column` elements,
    `table-column-group` elements are not rendered, but the value is
    useful for defining presentation for elements within the column
    group. The HTML equivalent is `<colgroup>`.

`table-cell`

:   Represents a []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039995936
    primary="table-cell keyword, display" data-type="indexterm"}single
    cell in a table. The HTML elements `<th>` and `<td>` are both
    examples of `table-cell` elements.

`table-caption`

:   Defines a []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039992288
    primary="table-caption keyword, display"
    data-type="indexterm"}table's caption. CSS does not define what
    should happen if multiple elements have the value `caption`, but it
    does explicitly warn, "Authors should not put more than one element
    with `display: caption` inside a table or inline-table
    [element."]{.keep-together}

You can get a quick summary of the general effects of these values by
taking an excerpt from the example HTML 4.0 stylesheet given in Appendix
D of the CSS 2.1 specification:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
table {display: table;}
tr {display: table-row;}
thead {display: table-header-group;}
tbody {display: table-row-group;}
tfoot {display: table-footer-group;}
col {display: table-column;}
colgroup {display: table-column-group;}
td, th {display: table-cell;}
caption {display: table-caption;}
```

In XML, where elements will not have display semantics by default, these
values become quite useful. Consider the following markup:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<scores>
    <headers>
        <label>Team</label>
        <label>Score</label>
    </headers>
    <game sport="MLB" league="NL">
        <team>
            <name>Reds</name>
            <score>8</score>
        </team>
        <team>
            <name>Cubs</name>
            <score>5</score>
        </team>
    </game>
</scores>
```

This could be formatted in a tabular fashion by using the following
styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
scores {display: table;}
headers {display: table-header-group;}
game {display: table-row-group;}
team {display: table-row;}
label, name, score {display: table-cell;}
```

The various cells could then be styled as necessary---for example,
boldfacing the `<label>` elements and right-aligning the `<score>`s.

::: {#ch13.xhtml_row-primacy .sect3}
### Row primacy {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1205}

CSS defines its []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039772848
primary="row primacy, tables"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039772112
primary="table layout" secondary="row primacy"
data-type="indexterm"}table model as *row primacy*. This model assumes
that authors will use markup languages in which rows are explicitly
declared. Columns, on the other hand, are derived from the layout of the
rows of cells. Thus, the first column is made up of the first cells in
each row; the second column is made up of the second cells, and so
forth.

Row primacy is not a major issue in HTML, because the markup language is
already row-oriented. In XML, row primacy has more of an impact because
it constrains the way authors can define table markup. Because of the
row-oriented nature of the CSS table model, a markup language in which
columns are the basis of table layout is not really possible (assuming
that the intent is to use CSS to present such
[documents).]{.keep-together}

### Columns {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1206}

Although the CSS []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039767392
primary="columns, properties for table" data-type="indexterm"}table
model is row oriented, columns do still play a part in layout. A cell
can belong to both contexts (row and column), even though it is
descended from row elements in the document source. In CSS, however,
columns and column groups can accept only four nontable properties:
`border`, `background`, `width`, and `visibility`{.keep-together}.

In addition, each of these four properties has special rules that apply
only in the columnar context:

`border`

:   Borders []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039762048 primary="borders"
    secondary="table-cell"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039761040
    primary="cell borders, table" data-type="indexterm"}can be set for
    columns and column groups only if the property `border-collapse` has
    the value `collapse`. In such []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039759408
    primary="collapsed cell borders, table"
    data-type="indexterm"}circumstances, column and column-group borders
    participate in the collapsing algorithm that sets the border styles
    at each cell edge. (See ["Collapsed Cell
    Borders"](#ch13.xhtml_collapsing-cell-borders){data-type="xref"}.)

`background`

:   The background of a column or column group will be visible only in
    cells where both the cell and its row have transparent backgrounds.
    (See ["Working with Table
    Layers"](#ch13.xhtml_table-layers){data-type="xref"}.)

`width`

:   The `width` property[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039716160
    primary="width property" secondary="table columns"
    data-type="indexterm"} defines the *minimum* width of the column or
    column group. The content of cells within the column (or group) may
    force the column to become wider.

`visibility`

:   If the []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039713296
    primary="visibility property" secondary="table columns"
    data-type="indexterm"}value of `visibility` for a column or column
    group is `collapse`, none of the cells in the column (or group) are
    rendered. Cells that span from the [collapsed]{.keep-together}
    column into other columns are clipped, as are cells that span from
    other columns into the collapsed column. Furthermore, the overall
    width of the table is reduced by the width the column would have
    taken up. A declaration of any `visibility` value other than
    `collapse` is ignored for a column or column
    group.[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797039709936 primary=""

## Inserting Anonymous Table Objects {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1207}

A []{#ch13.xhtml_ix_tables_anon_obj primary="table layout"
secondary="anonymous objects"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch13.xhtml_ix_anon_table_obj
primary="anonymous items" secondary="table objects"
data-type="indexterm"}markup language might not contain enough elements
to fully represent tables as they are defined in CSS, or an author could
forget to include all the necessary elements. For example, consider this
HTML:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<table>
    <td>Shirt size:</td>
    <td><select> … </select></td>
</table>
```

You might glance at this markup and assume that it defines a two-cell
table of a single row, but structurally, there is no element defining a
row (because the `<tr>` is missing).

To cover such possibilities, CSS defines a mechanism for inserting
"missing" table components as anonymous objects. For a basic example of
how this works, let's revisit our missing-row HTML example. In CSS
terms, what effectively happens is that an anonymous table-row object is
inserted between the `<table>` element and its descendant [table
cells:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<table>
  <!--anonymous table-row object begins-->
    <td>Name:</td>
    <td><input type="text"></td>
  <!--anonymous table-row object ends-->
</table>
```

[Figure 13-2](#ch13.xhtml_anon-obj-row){data-type="xref"} shows a visual
representation of this process. The dotted line represents the inserted
anonymous table row.

<figure class="bordernone">

<h6 id="ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1208"><span class="label">Figure 13-2.
</span>Anonymous-object generation in table formatting</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Seven kinds of anonymous-object insertions can occur in the CSS table
model. These seven rules are, like inheritance and specificity, an
example of a mechanism that attempts to impose intuitive sense on the
way CSS behaves.

The rules are as follows:

1.  If a `table-cell` element's parent is not a `table-row` element, an
    anonymous `table-row` object is inserted between the `table-cell`
    [element]{.keep-together} and its parent. The inserted object will
    include all consecutive siblings of the `table-cell` element.

    The same holds true even if the parent element is a
    `table-row-group`. For example, assume that the following CSS
    applies to the XML after it:

    ``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    system {display: table;}
    planet {display: table-row-group;}
    name, moons {display: table-cell;}
    ```

    ``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
    <system>
        <planet>
            <name>Mercury</name>
            <moons>0</moons>
        </planet>
        <planet>
            <name>Venus</name>
            <moons>0</moons>
        </planet>
    </system>
    ```

    Both sets of cells will be enclosed in an anonymous `table-row`
    object that is inserted between them and the `<planet>` elements.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2.  If a `table-row` element's parent is not a `table`, `inline-table`,
    or `table-row-group` element, then an anonymous `table` element is
    inserted between the `table-row` [element]{.keep-together} and its
    parent. The inserted object will include all consecutive siblings of
    the `table-row` element. Consider the following styles and markup:

    ``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    docbody {display: block;}
    planet {display: table-row;}
    ```

    ``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
    <docbody>
        <planet>
            <name>Mercury</name>
            <moons>0</moons>
        </planet>
        <planet>
            <name>Venus</name>
            <moons>0</moons>
        </planet>
    </docbody>
    ```

    Because the `display` value of the `<planet>` elements' parent is
    `block`, the anonymous `table` object is inserted between the
    `<planet>` elements and the `<docbody>` element. This anonymous
    `table` object will enclose both `<planet>` elements, since they are
    consecutive siblings.

3.  If a `table-column` element's parent is not a `table`,
    `inline-table`, or `table-column-group` element, then an anonymous
    `table` element is inserted between the `table-column` element and
    its parent. This is much the same as the `table-row` rule just
    discussed, except for its column-oriented nature.

4.  If the parent element of a `table-row-group`, `table-header-group`,
    `table-footer-group`, `table-column-group`, or `table-caption`
    element is not a `table` element, then an anonymous `table` object
    is inserted between the element and [its parent.]{.keep-together}

5.  If a child element of a `table` or `inline-table` element is not a
    `table-row-group`, `table-header-group`, `table-footer-group`,
    `table-row`, or `table-caption` element, then an anonymous
    `table-row` object is inserted between the `table` element and its
    child element. This anonymous object spans all the consecutive
    siblings of the child element that are not `table-row-group`,
    `table-header-group`, `table-footer-group`, `table-row`, or
    `table-caption` elements. Consider the following markup and styles:

    ``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    system {display: table;}
    planet {display: table-row;}
    name, moons {display: table-cell;}
    ```

    ``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
    <system>
        <planet>
            <name>Mercury</name>
            <moons>0</moons>
        </planet>
        <name>Venus</name>
        <moons>0</moons>
    </system>
    ```

    Here, a single anonymous `table-row` object will be inserted between
    the `<system>`{.keep-together} element and the second set of
    `<name>` and `<moons>` elements. The `<planet>` element is not
    enclosed by the anonymous object because its `display` is
    `table-row`.

6.  If a child element of a `table-row-group`, `table-header-group`, or
    `table-footer-group` element is not a `table-row` element, an
    anonymous `table-row` object is inserted between the element and its
    child element. This anonymous object spans all the consecutive
    siblings of the child element that are not `table-row` objects
    themselves. Consider the following markup and styles:

    ``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    system {display: table;}
    planet {display: table-row-group;}
    name, moons {display: table-cell;}
    ```

    ``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
    <system>
        <planet>
            <name>Mercury</name>
            <moons>0</moons>
        </planet>
        <name>Venus</name>
        <moons>0</moons>
    </system>
    ```

    In this case, each set of `<name>` and `<moons>` elements will be
    enclosed in an anonymous `table-row` element. For the second set,
    the insertion happens in accord with rule 5. For the first set, the
    anonymous object is inserted between the `<planet>` element and its
    children because the `<planet>` element is a `table-row-group`
    [element.]{.keep-together}

7.  If a child element of a `table-row` element is not a `table-cell`
    element, then an anonymous `table-cell` object is inserted between
    the element and its child element. This anonymous object encloses
    all consecutive siblings of the child element that are not
    `table-cell` elements themselves. Consider the following markup and
    styles:

    ``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    system {display: table;}
    planet {display: table-row;}
    name, moons {display: table-cell;}
    ```

    ``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
    <system>
        <planet>
            <name>Mercury</name>
            <num>0</num>
        </planet>
    </system>
    ```

    Because the element `<num>` does not have a table-related `display`
    value, an anonymous `table-cell` object is inserted between the
    `<planet>` element and the `<num>` [element.]{.keep-together}

    This behavior also extends to the encapsulation of anonymous inline
    boxes. Suppose that the `<num>` element is not included:

    ``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
    <system>
        <planet>
            <name>Mercury</name>
            0
        </planet>
    </system>
    ```

    The `0` would still be enclosed in an anonymous `table-cell` object.
    To further illustrate this point, here is an example adapted from
    the CSS specification:

    ``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
    example {display: table-cell;}
    row {display: table-row;}
    hey {font-weight: 900;}
    ```

    ``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
    <example>
        <row>This is the <hey>top</hey> row.</row>
        <row>This is the <hey>bottom</hey> row.</row>
    </example>
    ```

    Within each `<row>` element, the text fragments and `hey` element
    are enclosed in anonymous `table-cell`
    objects.[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797066434608 primary=""

## Working with Table Layers {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1209}

For the []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797066431088 primary="table layout"
secondary="layers in" data-type="indexterm"}assembly of a table's
presentation, CSS defines six individual *layers* on which the various
aspects of a table are placed.
[Figure 13-3](#ch13.xhtml_layers-formatting-schematic){data-type="xref"}
shows these layers.

<figure>
<div id="ch13.xhtml_layers-formatting-schematic" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1303.png" width="600" height="440"

<h6 id="ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1210"><span class="label">Figure 13-3.
</span>The formatting layers used in table presentation</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Basically, the styles for each aspect of the table are drawn on their
individual layers. Thus, if the `<table>` element has a green background
and a 1-pixel black border, those styles are drawn on the lowest layer.
Any styles for the column groups are drawn on the next layer up, the
columns themselves on the layer above that, and so on. The top layer,
which corresponds to the table cells, is drawn last.

For the most part, this is a logical process; after all, if you declare
a background color for table cells, you would want that drawn over the
background for the table element. The most important point revealed by
[Figure 13-3](#ch13.xhtml_layers-formatting-schematic){data-type="xref"}
is that column styles come below row styles, so a row's background will
overwrite a column's background.

It is important to remember that by default, all elements have
transparent backgrounds. Thus, in the following markup, the table
element's background will be visible "through" cells, rows, columns, and
so forth that do not have a background of their own, as
[illustrated]{.keep-together} in
[Figure 13-4](#ch13.xhtml_layers-seeing-background){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<table style="background: #B84;">
    <tr>
        <td>hey</td>
        <td style="background: #ABC;">there</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>what’s</td>
        <td>up?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background: #CBA;">
        <td>not</td>

## Using Captions {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1212}

A *table caption* is []{#ch13.xhtml_ix_caption_side_prop
primary="caption-side property" data-type="indexterm"}about what you'd
expect: a short bit of text that describes the nature of the table's
contents. A chart of stock quotes for the fourth quarter of 2026,
therefore, might have a caption element whose contents read "Q4 2026
Stock Performance." With the property `caption-side`, you can place this
element either above or below the table, regardless of where the caption
appears in the table's structure. (In HTML5, the
[`<caption>`]{.keep-together} element can appear only as the first child
of a `<table>` element, but other languages may have different rules.)

```
Captions are a bit odd, at least in visual terms. The CSS specification
states that a caption is formatted as if it were a block box placed
immediately before (or after) the table's box, with one exception: the
caption can still inherit values from the table.

A simple example should suffice to illustrate most of the important
aspects of caption presentation. Consider the following, illustrated in
[Figure 13-5](#ch13.xhtml_captions-styling){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
table {color: white; background: #840; margin: 0.5em 0;}
caption {background: #B84; margin: 1em 0;}
table.one caption {caption-side: top;}
table.two caption {caption-side: bottom;}
td {padding: 0.5em;}
```

The text in each `<caption>` element inherits the `color` value `white`
from the table, while the caption gets its own background. The
separation between each table's outer border edge and the caption's
outer margin edge is 1 em, as the margins of the table and the caption
have collapsed. Finally, the width of the caption is based on the
content width of the `<table>` element, which is considered to be the
containing block of the caption.

For the most part, captions are styled just like any block-level
element: they can be padded, have borders, be given backgrounds, and so
on. For example, if we need to change the horizontal alignment of text
within the caption, we use the property `text-align`. Thus, to
right-align the caption in the previous example, we would write
this:[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797066211840 primary=""

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

The whole point of this property is to offer a way to determine which
border model the user agent will employ. If the value `collapse` is in
effect, the collapsed border model is used. If the value is `separate`,
the separated border model is used. We'll look at the latter model
first, since it's much easier to describe and is the default.

## Separated Cell Borders {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1217}

In the []{#ch13.xhtml_ix_sep_cell_border_table
primary="separated cell borders, table" data-type="indexterm"}separated
border model, every cell in the table is separated from the other cells
by some distance, and the borders of cells do not collapse into one
another. Thus, given the following styles and markup, you should get the
result shown in
[Figure 13-6](#ch13.xhtml_borders-separated){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
td {border: 3px double black; padding: 3px;}
tr:nth-child(2) td:nth-child(2) {border-color: gray;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>cell three</td>
        <td>cell four</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```

Note that the cell borders touch but remain distinct from one another.
The three lines between cells are actually the two double borders
sitting right next to each other; the gray border around the fourth cell
helps make this more clear.

The HTML []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797066024624
primary="cellspacing attribute, HTML" data-type="indexterm"}attribute
`cellspacing` is included in the preceding example to make sure the
cells have no separation between them, but its presence is likely a bit
troubling. After all, if you can define borders as separate, there ought
to be a way to use CSS to alter the spacing between cells. Fortunately,
there is.

certain distance. This can be easily accomplished with the property
`border-spacing`, which provides a more powerful replacement for the
HTML attribute `cellspacing`.

  **Computed value**   Two absolute lengths
  **Inherited**        Yes
  **Animatable**       Yes

  -------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
Either one or two lengths can be given for the value of this property.
If you want all your cells separated by a single pixel,
`border-spacing: 1px;` will suffice. If, on the other hand, you want
cells to be separated by 1 pixel horizontally and 5 pixels vertically,
write `border-spacing: 1px 5px;`. If two lengths are supplied, the first
is always the horizontal separation, and the second is always the
vertical.

The spacing values are also applied between the borders of cells along
the outside of a table and the padding on the `table` element itself.
Given the following styles, you would get a result like that shown in
[Figure 13-7](#ch13.xhtml_border-spacing-cells-table){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
table {border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 5px 8px;
padding: 12px; border: 2px solid black;}
td { border: 1px solid gray;}
td#squeeze {border-width: 5px;}
```

[Figure 13-7](#ch13.xhtml_border-spacing-cells-table){data-type="xref"}
displays a space 5 pixels wide between the borders of any two
horizontally adjacent cells, and 17 pixels of space between the borders
of the right- and leftmost cells and the right and left borders of the
`<table>` element. Similarly, the borders of vertically adjacent cells
are 8 pixels apart, and the borders of the cells in the top and bottom
rows are 20 pixels from the top and bottom borders of the table,
respectively. The separation between cell borders is constant throughout
the table, regardless of the border widths of the cells themselves.

Note also that declaring a `border-spacing` value is done on the table
itself, not on the individual cells. If `border-spacing` had been
declared for the `<td>` elements in the previous example, it would have
been ignored.

If `empty-cells` is set to `show`, the borders and background of an
empty cell will be drawn, just as with table cells that have content. If
the value is `hide`, no part of the cell is drawn, as if the cell were
set to `visibility: hidden`.

If a cell contains any content, it cannot be considered empty.
*Content*, in this case, includes not only text, images, form elements,
and so on, but also the nonbreaking space entity (`&nbsp;`) and any
other whitespace *except* the carriage return (CR), line feed (LF), tab,
and space characters. If all the cells in a row are empty, and all have
an `empty-cells` value of `hide`, the entire row is treated as if the
row element were set to `display: none`.[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797065871488

border model largely describes how HTML tables have always been laid out
when they don't have any cell spacing, it is quite a bit more
complicated than the separated borders model. The following rules set
collapsing cell borders apart from the separated borders model:

-   Elements with a `display` of `table` or `inline-table` cannot have
    any padding when `border-collapse` is `collapse`, although they can
    have margins. Thus, separation never occurs between the border
    around the outside of the table and the edges of its outermost cells
    in the collapsed border model.

-   Borders can be applied to cells, rows, row groups, columns, and
    column groups. A table itself can, as always, have a border.

-   Separation never exists between cell borders in the collapsed border
    model. In fact, borders collapse into each other where they adjoin,
    so that only one of the collapsing borders is actually drawn. This
    is somewhat akin to margin collapsing, where the largest margin
    wins. When cell borders collapse, the "most interesting" border
    wins.

-   Once they are collapsed, the borders between cells are centered on
    the hypothetical grid lines between the cells.

We'll explore the last two points in more detail in the next two
sections.

::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Collapsing border layout" data-type="sect3"}
:::: {#ch13.xhtml_collapsing-border-layout .sect3}
### Collapsing border layout {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1225}

To better understand how the collapsed border model works, let's look at
the layout of a single table row, as shown in
[Figure 13-8](#ch13.xhtml_border-spacing-collapsed-row-layout){data-type="xref"}.

The padding and content width of each cell is inside the borders, as
expected. For the borders between cells, half of the border is to one
side of the grid line between two cells, and the other half is to the
other side. In each case, only a single border is drawn along each cell
edge. You might think that half of each cell's border is drawn to each
side of the grid line, but that's not what happens.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch13.xhtml_border-spacing-collapsed-row-layout" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1226"><span class="label">Figure 13-8.
</span>The layout of a table row using the collapsing borders model</h6>
</div>
</figure>

For example, assume that the solid borders on the middle cell are green
and the solid borders on the outer two cells are red. The borders on the
right and left sides of the middle cell (which collapse with the
adjacent borders of the outer cells) will be all green, or all red,
depending on which border wins out. We'll discuss how to tell which one
wins in the next section.

You may have noticed that the outer borders protrude past the table's
width. This is because in this model, *half* the table's borders are
included in the width. The other half stick out beyond that distance,
sitting in the margin itself. This might seem a bit weird, but that's
how the model is defined to work.

The specification includes a layout formula reproduced here for the
benefit of those who enjoy such things:

::: {data-type="equation"}
row width = (0.5 × border-width-0) + padding-left-1 + width-1 +
padding-right-1 + border-width-1 + padding-left-2 +\...+
padding-right-*n* + (0.5 × border-width-*n*)
:::

Each `border-width`-*`n`* refers to the border between cell *n* and the
next cell; thus, `border-width-3` refers to the border between the third
and fourth cells. The value *`n`* stands for the total number of cells
in the row.

This mechanism has a slight exception. When beginning the layout of a
collapsed-border table, the user agent computes an initial left and
right border for the table itself. It does this by examining the left
border of the first cell in the first row of the table and by taking
half of that border's width as the table's initial left border width.
The user agent then examines the right border of the last cell in the
first row and uses half that width to set the table's initial right
border width. For any row after the first, if the left or right border
is wider than the initial border widths, it sticks out into the margin
area of the table.

If a border is an odd number of display elements (pixels, printer dots,
etc.) wide, the user agent is left to decide what to do about centering
the border on the grid line. The user agent might shift the border so
that it is slightly off-center, round up or down to an even number of
display elements, use anti-aliasing, or adjust anything else that seems
[reasonable.]{.keep-together}

::: {#ch13.xhtml_border-collapsing .sect3}
### Border collapsing {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1227}

When two or more borders are adjacent, they collapse into each other. In
fact, they don't collapse so much as fight it out to see which will gain
supremacy over the others. Strict rules govern which borders will win
and which will not:

-   If one of the collapsing borders has a `border-style` of `hidden`,
    it takes precedence over all other collapsing borders. All borders
    at this location are hidden.

-   If all the borders are visible, wider borders take precedence over
    narrower ones. Thus, if a 2-pixel dotted border and a 5-pixel double
    border collapse, the border at that location will be a 5-pixel
    double border.

-   If all collapsing borders have the same width but different border
    styles, the border style is taken in the following order, from most
    to least preferred: `double`, `solid`, `dashed`, `dotted`, `ridge`,
    `outset`, `groove`, `inset`, `none`. Thus, if two borders with the
    same width are collapsing, and one is `dashed` while the other is
    `outset`, the border at that location will be dashed.

-   If collapsing borders have the same style and width, but differ in
    color, the color used is taken from an element in the following
    list, from most preferred to least: cell, row, row group, column,
    column group, table. Thus, if the borders of a cell and a column
    (identical in every way except color) collapse, the cell's border
    color (and style and width) will be used. If the collapsing borders
    come from the same type of element, such as two row borders with the
    same style and width but different colors, the color is taken from
    borders that are closer to the block-start and inline-start edges of
    the element.

The following styles and markup, presented in
[Figure 13-9](#ch13.xhtml_border-spacing-collapsed-unusual){data-type="xref"},

<span class="keep-together">unusual results</span></h6>
</div>
</figure>

Let's consider what happens for each of the cells, in turn:

-   For cells 1-1 and 1-4, the 5-pixel borders are wider than any of
    their adjacent borders, so they win out not only over adjoining cell
    borders, but over the border of the table itself. The only exception
    is the bottom of cell 1-1, which is suppressed.

-   The bottom border on cell 1-1 is suppressed because cells 2-1 and
    2-2, with their explicitly hidden borders, completely remove any
    borders from the edge of the cells. Again, the table's border loses
    out (on the left edge of cell 2-1) to a cell's border. The bottom
    border of cell 4-1 is also hidden, and so it prevents any border
    from appearing below the cell.

-   The 3-pixel double border of cell 2-4 is overridden on top by the
    5-pixel solid border of cell 1-4. Cell 2-4's border, in turn,
    overrides the border between itself and cell 2-3 because it is both
    wider and "more interesting." Cell 2-4 also overrides the border
    between itself and cell 3-4, even though both are the same width,
    because 2-4's double style is defined to be "more interesting" than
    3-4's dotted border.

-   The 13-pixel bottom silver border of cell 3-3 not only overrides the
    top border of cell 4-3, but it also affects the layout of content
    within both cells *and* the rows that contain both cells.

-   For cells along the outer edge of the table that aren't specially
    styled, their 1-pixel solid borders are overridden by the 3-pixel
    outset border on the table element itself.

This is, in fact, about as complicated as it sounds, although the
behaviors are largely intuitive and make a little more sense with
practice. It's worth noting that the basic Netscape 1.1-era table
presentation can be captured with a fairly simple set of rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
table {border-collapse: collapse; border: 2px outset gray;}
td {border: 1px inset gray;}

Since there are two ways to figure out the width of a table, it's only
logical that there is a way to declare which should be used for a given
table. You can use the property `table-layout` to select between the two
kinds of table width calculations.

While the two models can have different results in laying out a given
table, the fundamental difference between the two is that of speed. With
a fixed-width table layout, the user agent can calculate the layout of
the table more quickly than is possible in the automatic-width model.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Fixed layout" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch13.xhtml_fixed-layout .sect3}
### Fixed layout {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1232}

The main reason the fixed-layout model is so fast is that its layout
does not fully depend on the contents of table cells. Instead, it's
driven by the width values of the table, its column elements, and the
cells of the first row within that table.

The fixed-layout model works in the following steps:

-   Any column element whose `width` property has a value other than
    `auto` sets the width for that entire column.

    -   If a column has an `auto` width, but the cell in the first row
        of the table within that column has a `width` other than `auto`,
        the cell sets the width for that entire column. If the cell
        spans multiple columns, the width is divided between the
        columns.

    -   Any columns that are still auto-sized are sized so that their
        widths are as equal as possible.

At that point, the width of the table is set to be either the value of
`width` for the table or the sum of the column widths, whichever is
*greater*. If the table turns out to be wider than its columns, the
difference is divided by the number of columns and the result is added
to each of them.

This approach is fast because all of the column widths are defined by
the first row of the table. The cells in any rows that come after the
first are sized according to the column widths that were defined by the
first row. The cells in those following rows do not---indeed,
cannot---change column widths, which means that any `width` value
assigned to those cells will be ignored. If a cell's content does not
fit into its cell, the `overflow` value for the cell determines whether
the cell contents are clipped, visible, or generate [a
scrollbar.]{.keep-together}

Let's consider the following styles and markup, which are illustrated in
[Figure 13-10](#ch13.xhtml_table-layout-fixed){data-type="xref"}:

The first column is 200 pixels wide, which happens to be half the
400-pixel width of the table. The second column is 75 pixels wide,
because the first-row cell within that column has been assigned an
explicit width. The third and fourth columns are each 61 pixels wide.
Why? Because the sum of the column widths for the first and second
columns (275 pixels), plus the various borders between columns (3
pixels), equals 278 pixels. Then, 400 minus 278 is 122, and that divided
in half is 61, so that's how many pixels wide the third and fourth
columns will be. What about the 500-pixel width for `#r2c3`? It's
ignored because that cell isn't in the first row of the table.

Note that the table doesn't need to have an explicit `width` value to
use the fixed-width layout model, although it definitely helps. For
example, given the following, a user agent could calculate a width for
the table that is 50 pixels narrower than the parent element's width. It
would then use that calculated width in the fixed-layout algorithm:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
table {table-layout: fixed; margin: 0 25px; width: auto;}
```

This is not required, however. User agents are also permitted to lay out
any table with an `auto` value for `width` by using the automatic-width
layout model.[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797065196496 primary=""

### Automatic layout {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1234}

The []{#ch13.xhtml_ix_table_layout_prop primary="table-layout property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch13.xhtml_ix_auto_width_table
primary="automatic-width layout, tables"
data-type="indexterm"}automatic-width layout model, while not as fast as
fixed layout, is probably much more familiar to you because it's
substantially the same model that HTML tables have used since their
inception. In most current browsers, use of this model will be triggered
by a table having a `width` of `auto`, regardless of the value of
`table-layout`, although this is not assured.

The reason automatic layout is slower is that the table cannot be laid
out until the user agent has looked at all of the content in the table.
The user agent must lay out the entire table in a fashion that takes the
contents and styles of every cell into account. This generally requires
the user agent to perform some calculations and then go back through the
table to perform a second set of calculations (if not more).

The content has to be fully examined because, as with HTML tables, the
table's layout is dependent on the content in all the cells. If a
400-pixel-wide image is in a cell in the last row, that content will
force all of the cells above it (those in the same column) to be at
least 400 pixels wide. Thus, the width of every cell has to be
calculated, and adjustments must be made (possibly triggering another
round of content-width calculations) before the table can be laid out.

The details of the model can be expressed in the following steps:

1.  For each cell in a column, calculate both the minimum and maximum
    cell width.

    1.  Determine the minimum width required to display the content. In
        determining this minimum content width, the content can flow to
        any number of lines, but it may not stick out of the cell's box.
        If the cell has a `width` value that is larger than the minimum
        possible width, the minimum cell width is set to the value of
        `width`. If the cell's `width` value is `auto`, the minimum cell
        width is set to the minimum content width.

    2.  For the maximum width, determine the width required to display
        the content without any line breaking other than that forced by
        explicit line breaking (e.g., the `<br>` element). That value is
        the maximum cell width.

2.  For each column, calculate both the minimum and maximum column
    width.

    1.  The column's minimum width is determined by the largest minimum
        cell width of the cells within the column. If the column has
        been given an explicit `width` value that is larger than any of
        the minimum cell widths within the column, the minimum column
        width is set to the value of `width`.

    2.  For the maximum width, take the largest maximum cell width of
        the cells within the column. If the column has been given an
        explicit `width` value that is larger than any of the maximum
        cell widths within the column, the maximum column width is set
        to the value of `width`. These two behaviors re-create the
        traditional HTML table behavior of forcibly expanding any column
        to be as wide as its widest cell.

3.  If a cell spans more than one column, the sum of the minimum column
    widths must be equal to the minimum cell width for the spanning
    cell. Similarly, the sum of the maximum column widths has to equal
    the spanning cell's maximum width. User agents should divide any
    changes in column widths equally among the spanned columns.

In addition, the user agent must take into account that when a column
has a percentage value for its width, the percentage is calculated in
relation to the width of the table---even though the user agent doesn't
yet know what that will be! It instead has to hang on to the percentage
value and use it in the next part of the algorithm.

At this point, the user agent will have figured how wide or narrow each
column *can* be. With that information in hand, it can then proceed to
actually figuring out the width of the table. This happens as follows:

1.  If the computed width of the table is not `auto`, the computed table
    width is compared to the sum of all the column widths *plus* any
    borders and cell spacing. (Columns with percentage widths are likely
    calculated at this time.) The larger of the two is the final width
    of the table. If the table's computed width is *larger* than the sum
    of the column widths, borders, and cell spacing, then the difference
    is divided by the number of columns and the result is added to each
    of them.

2.  If the computed width of the table is `auto`, the final width of the
    table is determined by adding up the column widths, borders, and
    cell spacing. This means that the table will be only as wide as
    needed to display its content, just as with traditional HTML tables.
    Any columns with percentage widths use that percentage as a
    constraint---but one that a user agent does not have to satisfy.

Once the last step is completed, then---and only then---can the user
agent actually lay out the table.

Let's consider what happens for each of the columns, in turn:

-   For the first column, the only explicit cell or column width is that
    of cell 4-1, which is given a width of `100px`. Because the content
    is so short, both the minimum and maximum column widths are set to
    `100px`. (If a cell in the column had several sentences of text, it
    would have increased the maximum column width to whatever width
    necessary to display all of the text without line breaking.)

-   For the second column, two `width`s are declared: cell 1-2 is given
    a width of `40%`, and cell 2-2 is given a width of `50px`. The
    minimum width of this column is `50px`, and the maximum width is
    `40%` of the final table width.

-   For the third column, only cell 3-3 has an explicit width (`35px`),
    but the column itself is given a `width` of `25%`. Therefore, the
    minimum column width is 35 pixels, and the maximum width is 25% of
    the final table width.

-   For the fourth column, only cell 4-4 is given an explicit width
    (`1px`). This is smaller than the minimum content width, so both the
    minimum and maximum column widths are equal to the minimum content
    width of the cells. This turns out to be a computed 22 pixels, so
    the minimum and maximum widths are both 22 pixels.

The user agent now knows that the four columns have minimum and maximum
widths as follows, in order:

1.  Minimum 100 pixels, maximum 100 pixels

2.  Minimum 50 pixels, maximum 40%

3.  Minimum 35 pixels, maximum 25%

4.  Minimum 22 pixels, maximum 22 pixels

The table's minimum width is the sum of all the column minimums, plus
the borders collapsed between the columns, which totals 215 pixels. The
table's maximum width is `123px + 65%`, where the `123px` comes from the
first and last columns and their shares of the collapsed borders. This
maximum works out to be 351.42857142857143 pixels (given that `123px`
represents 35% of the overall table width). With this number in hand,
the second column will be 140.5 pixels wide, and the third column will
be 87.8 pixels wide. These may be rounded by the user agent to whole
numbers such as `141px` and `88px`, or not, depending on the exact
rendering method used. (These are the numbers used in
[Figure 13-11](#ch13.xhtml_table-layout-automatic){data-type="xref"}.)

Note that user agents are not required to actually use the maximum
value; they may choose another course of action.

This is (although it may not seem like it) a comparatively simple and
straightforward example: all of the content is basically the same width,
and most of the declared widths are pixel lengths. If a table contains
images, paragraphs of text, form elements, and so forth, the process of
figuring out the table's layout is likely to be a great deal more
[complicated]{.keep-together}.[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797064775632

secondary="height of"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797064771152
primary="height property" data-type="indexterm"}effort expended in
figuring out the width of the table, you might well wonder how much more
complicated height calculation will be. Actually, in CSS terms, it's
pretty simple, although browser developers probably don't think so.

The easiest situation to describe is one in which the table height is
explicitly set via the `height` property. In such cases, the height of
the table is defined by the value of `height`. This means that a table
may be taller or shorter than the sum of its row heights. Note that
`height` is treated much more like `min-height` for tables, so if you
define a `height` value that's smaller than the sum total of the row
heights, it may appear to be ignored.

By contrast, if the `height` value of a table is greater than the total
of its row heights, the specification explicitly refuses to define what
should happen, instead noting that the issue may be resolved in future
versions of CSS. A user agent could expand the table's rows to fill out
its height, or leave blank space inside the table's box, or something
completely different. It's up to each user agent to decide.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1237}

As of mid-2022, the most common behavior of user agents is to increase
the heights of the rows in a table to fill out its overall height. This
is accomplished by taking the difference between the table height and
the sum of the row heights, dividing it by the number of rows, and
applying the resulting amount to each row.
:::

If the `height` of the table is `auto`, its height is the sum of the
heights of all the rows within the table, plus any borders and cell
spacing. To determine the height of each row, the user agent goes
through a process similar to that used to find the widths of columns: it
calculates a minimum and maximum height for the contents of each cell
and then uses these to derive a minimum and maximum height for the row.
After having done this for all the rows, the user agent figures out what
each row's height should be, stacks them all on top of one another, and
uses the total to determine the table's height.

In addition to what to do about tables with explicit heights and how to
treat row heights within them, you can add the following to the list of
things CSS does not define:

-   The effect of a percentage height for table cells

-   The effect of a percentage height for table rows and row groups

-   How a row-spanning cell affects the heights of the rows that are
    spanned, except that the rows have to contain the spanning cell

As you can see, height calculations in tables are largely left up to
user agents to figure out. Historical evidence would suggest that this
will lead to each user agent doing something different, so you should
probably avoid setting table heights as much [as
possible.]{.keep-together}

    </td>

<h6 id="ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1239"><span class="label">Figure 13-12.
</span>Vertical alignment of cell contents</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In each case, the alignment is carried out by automatically increasing
the padding of the cell itself to achieve the desired effect. In the
first cell in
[Figure 13-12](#ch13.xhtml_alignment-vertical){data-type="xref"}, the
bottom padding of the cell has been changed to equal the difference
between the height of the cell's box and the height of the content
within the cell. For the second cell, the top and bottom padding of the
cell have been reset to be equal, thus vertically centering the content
of the cell. In the last cell, the cell's top padding has been altered.

The fourth possible alignment value is `baseline`, and it's a little
more complicated than the first three:

`baseline`

:   The []{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797064569056
    primary="baseline keyword, table" data-type="indexterm"}baseline of
    the cell is aligned with the baseline of its row; in the case of
    row-spanning cells, the baseline of the cell is aligned with the
    baseline of the first row it spans.

It's easiest to provide an illustration
([Figure 13-13](#ch13.xhtml_alignment-baseline){data-type="xref"}) and
then discuss what's [happening.]{.keep-together}

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch13.xhtml_alignment-baseline" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1313.png" width="600" height="169"

<h6 id="ch13.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1240"><span class="label">Figure 13-13.
</span>Baseline alignment of cell contents</h6>
</div>
</figure>

A row's baseline is defined by the lowest initial cell baseline (that
is, the baseline of the first line of text) out of all its cells. Thus,
in [Figure 13-13](#ch13.xhtml_alignment-baseline){data-type="xref"}, the
row's baseline is defined by the third cell, which has the lowest
initial baseline. The first two cells then have the baseline of their
first line of text aligned with the row's baseline.

As with top, middle, and bottom alignment, the placement of
baseline-aligned cell content is accomplished by altering the top and
bottom padding of the cells. If none of the cells in a row are
baseline-aligned, the row does not even have a baseline---it doesn't
really need one.

The detailed process for aligning cell contents within a row is as
follows:

-   If any of the cells are baseline-aligned, the row's baseline is
    determined and the content of the baseline-aligned cells is placed.

    -   Any top-aligned cell has its content placed. The row now has a
        provisional height, which is defined by the lowest cell bottom
        of the cells that have already had their content placed.

    -   If any remaining cells are middle- or bottom-aligned, and the
        content height is taller than the provisional row height, the
        height of the row is increased to enclose the tallest of those
        cells.

    -   All remaining cells have their content placed. In any cell whose
        contents are shorter than the row height, the cell's padding is
        increased in order to match the height of the row.

The `vertical-align` values `sub`, `super`, `text-top`, and
`text-bottom` are supposed to be ignored when applied to table cells.
Instead, they seem to be treated as if they are `baseline`, or possibly
`top`.[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797064484816 primary=""

Even if you're quite familiar with table layout from years of
table-and-spacer design, it turns out that the mechanisms driving such
layout are rather complicated. Thanks to the legacy of HTML table
construction, the CSS table model is row-centric, but it does,
thankfully, accommodate columns and limited column styling. Thanks to
new abilities to affect cell alignment and table width, you now have
even more tools for presenting tables in a pleasing
way.[]{#ch13.xhtml_idm45797064480976 primary=""
startref="ix_table_layout_ch13" data-type="indexterm"}

The ability to apply table-related display values to arbitrary elements
opens the door to creating table-like layouts by using HTML elements
such as `<div>` and `<section>`, or by using XML languages that allow
you to use any element to describe table components.

The "Font Properties" section of the []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_fonts_ch14
primary="fonts" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064474992
primary="CSS1 specification" secondary="fonts"
data-type="indexterm"}CSS1 specification, written in 1996, begins with
this sentence: "Setting font properties will be among the most common
uses of style sheets." Despite the awareness of font's importance from
the very beginning of CSS, it wasn't until about 2009 that this
capability really began to be widely and consistently supported. With
the introduction of variable fonts, typography on the web has become an
art form. While you can include any fonts you are legally allowed to
distribute in your design, you have to pay attention to how you use
them.

It's important to remember this does not grant absolute control over
fonts. If the font you're using fails to download, or is in a file
format the user's browser doesn't understand, the text will (eventually)
be displayed with a fallback font. That's a good thing, as it means the
user still gets your content.

While fonts may seem vital to a design, always bear in mind you can't
depend on the presence of a given font. If a font is slow to load,
browsers generally delay text rendering. While that prevents text being
redrawn while a user is reading, it's bad to have no text on the page.

Your font choice may also be overridden by user preference, or a browser
extension meant to enhance the reading experience. An example is the
browser extension OpenDyslexic, which "overrides all fonts on web pages
with the OpenDyslexic font, and formats pages to be more easily
readable." In general, always design assuming your fonts will be delayed
and even fail altogether.

# Font Families {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1242}

What we []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_fam_ch14 primary="fonts"
secondary="families" data-type="indexterm"}think of as a "font" is
usually composed of many variations to describe bold text, italic text,
bold italic text, and so on. For example, you're probably familiar with
(or at least have heard of) the font Times. Times is actually a
combination of many variants, including TimesRegular, TimesBold,
TimesItalic, TimesBoldItalic, and so on.
[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064469328 primary="fonts" secondary="font faces"
seealso="@font-face rule" data-type="indexterm"}Each variant of Times is
an actual *font face*, and Times, as we usually think of it, is a
combination of all these variant faces. In other words, system-standard
fonts like Times are actually a *font family*, not just a single font,
even though most of us think about fonts as being single entities.

With such []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064466496 primary="variable font files"
data-type="indexterm"}font families, a separate file is required for
each width, weight, and style combination (that is, each font face),
meaning you can have upward of 20 separate files for a complete
typeface. *Variable fonts*, on the other hand, are able to store
multiple variants, such as regular, bold, italic, and bold italic, in a
single file. Variable font files are generally a little bit larger
(maybe just a few kilobytes) than any single font face file, but smaller
than the multiple files required of a regular font, and require only a
single HTTP request.

To cover all the bases, CSS defines five generic font families:

*Serif fonts*

:   Serif []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064462304 primary="serif fonts"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064461568
    primary="proportional fonts" data-type="indexterm"}fonts are
    proportional and have serifs. A font is *proportional* if all
    characters in the font have different widths. For example, a
    lowercase *i* and a lowercase *m* take up different horizontal
    spaces because they have different widths. (This book's paragraph
    font is proportional, for example.) *Serifs* are the decorations on
    the ends of strokes within each character, such as little lines at
    the top and bottom of a lowercase *l*, or at the bottom of each leg
    of an uppercase *A*. Examples of serif fonts are Times, Georgia, and
    New Century Schoolbook.

*Sans-serif fonts*

:   Sans-serif []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064456896
    primary="sans-serif fonts" data-type="indexterm"}fonts are
    proportional and do not have serifs. Examples of sans-serif fonts
    are Helvetica, Geneva, Verdana, Arial, and Univers.

*Monospace fonts*

:   Monospace []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064454624 primary="monospace fonts"
    data-type="indexterm"}fonts are not proportional. Rather, each
    character uses up the same amount of horizontal space as all the
    others; thus, a lowercase *i* takes up the same horizontal space as
    a lowercase *m*, even though their actual letterforms may have
    different widths. These generally are used for displaying
    programmatic code or tabular data, like this book's code font, for
    example. If a font has uniform character widths, it is classified as
    monospace, regardless of whether it has serifs. Examples of
    monospace fonts are Courier, Courier New, Consolas, and Andale Mono.

*Cursive fonts*

:   Cursive []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064451456 primary="cursive fonts"
    data-type="indexterm"}fonts attempt to emulate human handwriting or
    lettering. Usually, they are composed largely of flowing curves and
    have stroke decorations that exceed those found in serif fonts. For
    example, an uppercase *A* might have a small curl at the bottom of
    its left leg or be composed entirely of swashes and curls. Examples
    of cursive fonts are Zapf Chancery, Author, and Comic Sans.

*Fantasy fonts*

:   Fantasy []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064448576 primary="fantasy fonts"
    data-type="indexterm"}fonts are not really defined by any single
    characteristic other than our inability to easily classify them in
    one of the other families (these are sometimes called *decorative*
    or *display* fonts). A few such fonts are Western, Woodblock, and
    Klingon.

Your operating system and browser will have a default font family for
each of these generic families. Fonts a browser cannot classify as
serif, sans-serif, monospace, or cursive are generally considered
fantasy. While most font families fall into one of these generic
families, not all do. For example, SVG icon fonts, dingbat fonts, and
Material Icons Round contain images rather than letters.

  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
If you want a document to use a sans-serif font but do not particularly
care which one, the appropriate declaration would be as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-family: sans-serif;}
```

This will cause the user agent to pick a sans-serif font family (such as
Helvetica) and apply it to the `<body>` element. Thanks to inheritance,
the same font family choice will be applied to all visible elements that
descend from the `<body>`, unless overridden by the user agent. User
agents generally apply a `font-family` property to some elements, such
as `monospace` in the case of `<code>` and `<pre>`, or a system font to
some form-input controls.

Using nothing more than these generic families, you can create a fairly
sophisticated stylesheet. The following rule set is illustrated in
[Figure 14-1](#ch14.xhtml_various_font_families){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-family: serif;}
h1, h2, h3, h4 {font-family: sans-serif;}
code, pre, kbd {font-family: monospace;}
p.signature {font-family: cursive;}
```

Thus, most of this document will use a serif font such as Times,
including all paragraphs except those that have a `class` of
`signature`, which will instead be rendered in a cursive font such as
Author. Heading levels 1 through 4 will use a sans-serif font like
Helvetica, while the elements `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<tt>`, and `<kbd>`
will use a monospace font [like Courier.]{.keep-together}

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1245}

Using generic defaults is excellent for rendering speed, as it allows
the browser to use whichever default fonts it already has in memory
rather than having to parse through a list of specific fonts and load
characters as needed.

A page author may, on the other hand, have more specific preferences for
which font to use in the display of a document or element. In a similar
vein, a user may want to create a user stylesheet that defines the exact
fonts to be used in the display of all documents. In either case,
`font-family` is still the property to use.

Assume for the moment that all `<h1>` elements should use Georgia as
their font. The simplest rule for this would be the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-family: Georgia;}
```

This will cause the user agent displaying the document to use Georgia
for all `<h1>` elements, assuming that the user agent has Georgia
available for use. If it doesn't, the user agent will be unable to use
the rule at all. It won't ignore the rule, but if it can't find a font
called `Georgia`, it can't do anything but display `<h1>` elements using
the user agent's default font.

To handle a situation like this, you can give the user agent options by
combining specific font families with generic font families. For
example, the following markup tells a user agent to use Georgia if it's
available, and to use another serif font like Times as a fallback if it
isn't:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-family: Georgia, serif;}
```

For this reason, we strongly []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064300592
primary="font stack" data-type="indexterm"}encourage you to always
provide a generic family as part of any `font-family` rule. By doing so,
you provide a fallback mechanism that lets user agents pick an
alternative when they can't provide an exact font match. This is often
referred to as a *font stack*. Here are a few more examples:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-family: Arial, sans-serif;}
h2 {font-family: Arvo, sans-serif;}
p {font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;}
address {font-family: Chicago, sans-serif;}
.signature {font-family: Author, cursive;}
```

If you're familiar with fonts, you might have a number of similar fonts
in mind for displaying a given element. Let's say that you want all
paragraphs in a document to be displayed using Times, but you would also
accept Times New Roman, Georgia, New Century Schoolbook, and New York
(all of which are serif fonts) as alternate choices. First, decide the
order of preference for these fonts, and then string them together with
commas:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', 'New Century Schoolbook', Georgia,
      'New York', serif;}
```

Based on this list, a user agent will look for the fonts in the order
they're listed. If none of the listed fonts are available, it will just
pick an available serif font.

::: {#ch14.xhtml_using_quotation_marks .sect2}
## Using Quotation Marks {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1247}

You may have []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064167200
primary="'…​' or \"…​\" (quotes)" secondary="enclosing font names"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064166224
primary="quotes ('…​' or \"…​\")" secondary="enclosing font names"
data-type="indexterm"}noticed the presence of single quotes in the
previous code example, which we haven't used before in this chapter.
Quotation marks are advisable in a `font-family` declaration only if a
font name contains one or more spaces, such as `New York`, or if the
font name includes symbols. Thus, a font called `Karrank%` should be
quoted:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {font-family: Wedgie, 'Karrank%', Klingon, fantasy;}
```

While quoting font names is almost never required, if you leave off the
quotation marks, user agents may ignore the font name and continue to
the next available font in the font stack. The exception to this is font
names that match accepted `font-family` keywords. For example, if your
font name is `cursive`, `serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`, or
`fantasy`, it must be quoted so the user agent knows the difference
between a font name and a font-family keyword, as shown here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {font-family: Author, "cursive", cursive;}
```

The actual generic family names (`serif`, `monospace`, etc.) should
never be quoted. If they are quoted, the browser will look for a font
with that exact name.

When quoting font names, either single or double quotes are acceptable,
as long as they match. Remember that if you place a `font-family` rule
in a `style` attribute, which you generally shouldn't, you'll need to
use whichever quotes you didn't use for the attribute itself. Therefore,
if you use double quotes to enclose the `font-family` rule, you'll have
to use single quotes within the rule, as in the following markup:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-family: sans-serif;}  /* sets paragraphs to sans-serif by default */
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<!-- the next example is correct (uses single-quotes) -->
<p style="font-family: 'New Century Schoolbook', Times, serif;">...</p>

<!-- the next example is NOT correct (uses double-quotes) -->
<p style="font-family: "New Century Schoolbook", Times, serif;">...</p>
```

If you use double quotes in such a circumstance, they interfere with the
attribute syntax. Note the font name is
case-insensitive.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797064011456 primary=""

# Using Custom Fonts {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1248}

The `@font-face` rule enables you to use
[]{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_face_ch14 primary="fonts" secondary="font faces"
data-type="indexterm"}custom fonts on the web, instead of being forced
to rely only on "web-safe" fonts (that is, font families that are widely
installed, such as Times). The two required functions of the
`@font-face` rule are to declare the name used to refer to a font and to
provide the URL of that font's file for downloading. In addition to
these required descriptors, CSS has 14 optional descriptors.

While there's no guarantee that every user will see the font you want,
`@font-face` is supported in all browsers except ones like Opera Mini
that intentionally don't support it for performance reasons.

Suppose you want to use a very specific font in your stylesheets, one
that is not widely installed. Through the magic of `@font-face`, you can
define a specific family name to correspond to a font file on your
server that you can refer to throughout your CSS. The user agent will
download that file and use it to render the text in your page, the same
as if it were installed on the user's machine. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf");
}
```

This allows you to tell user agents to load the defined *.otf* file and
use that font to render text when called upon via
`font-family: SwitzeraADF`.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1249}

The examples in this section refer to SwitzeraADF, a font face
collection available from the [Arkandis Digital
Foundry](http://arkandis.tuxfamily.org/openfonts.xhtml).

The `@font-face` declaration doesn't automatically load all the
referenced font files. []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797063966496
primary="lazy loading of font faces" data-type="indexterm"}The intent of
`@font-face` is to allow *lazy loading* of font faces. This means only
faces needed to render a document will be loaded. Font files referenced
in your CSS that aren't necessary to render the page will not be
downloaded. Font files are generally cached, and aren't redownloaded as
your users navigate your site.

The ability to load any font is quite powerful, but keep these concerns
in mind:

-   For security reasons, font files must be retrieved from the same
    domain as the page requesting them. There's a solution for that.

-   Requiring lots of font downloads can lead to slow load times.

-   Fonts with lots of characters can lead to large font files.
    Fortunately, online tools and CSS enable limiting character sets.

-   If fonts load slowly, this can lead to flashes of unstyled text or
    invisible text. CSS has a way of addressing this issue as well.

We'll cover these problems and their solutions in this chapter. But
remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use fonts wisely!

All the parameters that define the font you're referencing are contained

  Descriptor                  Default value   Description
  --------------------------- --------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `font-family`               *n/a*           *Required.* The name used for this font in `font-family` property values.
  `src`                       *n/a*           *Required.* One or more URLs pointing to the font file(s) that must be loaded to display the font.
  `font-display`              `auto`          Determines how a font face is displayed based on whether and when it is downloaded and ready to use.
  `font-stretch`              `normal`        Distinguishes between varying degrees of character widths (e.g., `condensed` and `expanded`).
  `font-style`                `normal`        Distinguishes between `normal`, `italic`, and `oblique` faces.
  `font-weight`               `normal`        Distinguishes between various weights (e.g., `bold`).
  `font-variant`              `normal`        A value of the `font-variant` property.
  `font-feature-settings`     `normal`        Permits direct access to low-level OpenType features (e.g., enabling ligatures).
  `font-variation-settings`   `normal`        Allows low-level control over OpenType or TrueType font variations, by specifying the four-letter axis names of the features to vary, along with their variation values.
  `ascent-override`           `normal`        Defines the ascent metric for the font.
  `descent-override`          `normal`        Defines the descent metric for the font.
  `line-gap-override`         `normal`        Defines the line gap metric for the font.
  `size-adjust`               `100%`          Defines a multiplier for glyph outlines and metrics associated with the font.
  `unicode-range`             `U+0-10FFFF`    Defines the range of characters for which a given face may be used.

The []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797036415376
primary="format() hint for font importing" data-type="indexterm"}point
of `src` is pretty straightforward, so we'll describe it first: `src`
lets you define one or more comma-separated sources for the font face
you're defining. With each source, you can provide an optional (but
recommended) format hint that can help improve download performance.

You can []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797036413072

secondary="URL for" data-type="indexterm"}point to a font face at any
URL---including files on the user's computer using `local()`, and files
elsewhere with `url()`. There is a default restriction: unless you set
an exception, font faces can be loaded from only the same origin as the
stylesheet. You can't simply point your `src` at someone else's site and
download their font. You'll need to host a local copy on your own
server, use HTTP access controls to relax the same domain restriction,
or use a font-hosting service that provides both the stylesheet(s) and
the font file(s).

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1253}

To create an exception to the same-origin restriction for fonts, include
the following in your server's *.htaccess* file:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<FilesMatch "\.(ttf|otf|woff|woff2)$">
  <IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
  </IfModule>
</FilesMatch>
```

The `FilesMatch` line []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797036385568
primary="<FilesMatch> for importing font faces"
primary-sortas="FilesMatch for importing font faces"
data-type="indexterm"}includes all the file extensions of the fonts you
want to import. This will allow anyone, from anywhere, to point at your
font files and load them directly off your server.
:::

You may be wondering how it is that we're defining `font-family` here
when it was already defined in a previous section. This `font-family` is
the font-family *descriptor*, whereas the previously defined
`font-family` is the font-family *property*. If this seems confusing,
stick with us a moment and all should become clear.

Essentially, `@font-face` lets you create low-level definitions that
underpin the font-related properties like `font-family`. When you define
a font family name via the descriptor `font-family: "Switzera";`, you're
setting up an entry in the user agent's table of font families that you
can refer to in your `font-family` property values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";   /* descriptor */
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf");
}
h1 {font-family: switzera, Helvetica, sans-serif;}  /* property */
```

Note that the `font-family` descriptor value and the entry in the
`font-family` property match case-insensitively. If they didn't match at
all, the `h1` rule would ignore the first font-family name listed in the
`font-family` value and move on to the next (Helvetica, in this case).

Also note that the `font-family` descriptor can be (almost) any name you
want to give it. It doesn't have to exactly match the name of the font
file, though it usually makes sense to use a descriptor that's at least
close to the font's name for purposes of clarity. That said, the value
used in the `font-family` property does have to (case-insensitively)
match the `font-family` descriptor.

As long as the font has cleanly downloaded and is in a format the user
agent can handle, it will be used in the manner you direct, as
illustrated in
[Figure 14-2](#ch14.xhtml_using_a_downloaded_font){data-type="xref"}.

In a []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797036294048
primary="format() hint for font importing"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797036293440
primary="@font-face rule" primary-sortas="font-face rule"
secondary="format() values" data-type="indexterm"}similar manner, the
comma-separated `src` descriptor value can provide fallbacks. That way,
if the user agent doesn't understand the file type defined by the hint
or, for whatever reason, the user agent is unable to download the first
source, it can move on to the second source and try to load the file
defined there:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf"),
         url("https://example.com/fonts/SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf");
}
```

Remember that the same-origin policy mentioned earlier generally applies
in this case, so pointing to a copy of the font on some other server
will usually fail, unless that server is set up to permit cross-origin
access.

If you want to be sure the user agent understands the kind of font
you're telling it to use, use the optional but highly recommended
`format()` hint:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

The advantage of supplying a `format()` hint is that user agents can
skip downloading files in formats they don't support, thus reducing
bandwidth use and load time. If no format hint is supplied, the font
resource will be downloaded even if its format isn't supported. The
`format()` hint also lets you explicitly declare a format for a file
that might not have a common filename extension:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype"),
         url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.true") format("truetype");
         /* TrueType font files usually end in '.ttf' */
}
```

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular-Color.otf")

}
```

  color-CBDT         Font colors are defined using the OpenType `CBDT` (Color Bitmap Data Table) table.
  color-COLRv0       Font colors are defined using the OpenType `COLR` (Color Table) table.
  color-COLRv1       Font colors are defined using the OpenType `COLR` table.

  {#recognized_font_tech_values}

Delving into the details of all these feature tables is well beyond the
scope of this book, and you are unlikely to need to use them most of the
time. Even if a font has one or more of the listed feature tables,
listing them is not required. Even with `tech("color-SVG")`, an SVG
color font will still render using its colors.

In []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797036044368 primary="@font-face rule"
primary-sortas="font-face rule" secondary="local() font function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797036043120
primary="local() font function, @font-face rule"
data-type="indexterm"}addition to the combination of `url()`,
`format()`, and `tech()`, you can supply a font family name (or several
names) in case the font is already locally available on the user's
machine, using the aptly named `local()` function:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    src: local("Switzera-Regular"),
         local("SwitzeraADF-Regular"),
         url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype"),
         url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.true") format("truetype");
}
```

In this example, the user agent looks to see if it already has a font
family named `Switzera-Regular` or `SwitzeraADF-Regular`,
case-insensitively, available on the local machine. If so, it will use
the name `Switzera` to refer to that locally installed font. If not, it
will use the `url()` values to try downloading the first remote font
listed that has a format type it supports.

Bear in mind that the order of the resources listed in `src` matters. As
soon as the browser encounters a source in a format it supports, it
attempts to use that source. For this reason, `local()` values should be
listed first, with no format hint needed. This should be followed by
external resources with file type hints, generally in order of smallest
file size to largest to minimize performance hits.

This capability allows an author to create custom names for locally
installed fonts. For example, you could set up a shorter name for
versions of Hiragino, a Japanese font, [like so:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Hiragino";
    src: local("Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro"),
         local("Hiragino Kaku Gothic Std");
}

h1, h2, h3 {font-family: Hiragino, sans-serif;}
```

As long as the user has one of the versions of Hiragino Kaku Gothic
installed on their machine, those rules will cause the first three
heading levels to be rendered using that font.

Online services let you upload font-face files and generate all the
`@font-face` rules you need, convert those files to all the formats
required, and hand everything back to you as a single package. One of
the best known is [Font Squirrel's \@Font-Face Kit
Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator). Just
make sure you're legally able to convert and use the font faces you're

# Custom Font Considerations {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1255}

You []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035937856 primary="@font-face rule"
primary-sortas="font-face rule" secondary="custom font considerations"
data-type="indexterm"}need to keep two points in mind when using
customized fonts. The first is that you legally must have the rights to
use the font in a web page, and the second is whether it's a good idea
to do so.

Much like []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035936096 primary="fonts"
secondary="licensing issue"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035935088
primary="@font-face rule" primary-sortas="font-face rule"
secondary="licenses for" data-type="indexterm"}stock photography,
commercial font families come with licenses that govern their use, and
not every font license permits its use on the web. You can completely
avoid this question by using only free and open source software (FOSS)
fonts, or by using a commercial service like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts
that deals with the licensing and format conversion issues so you don't
have to. Otherwise, you need to make sure you have the legal right to
use a font face in the way you want to use it, just the same as you make
sure you have the proper license for any images you want to use in your
designs.

In addition, the more []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035933360
primary="performance issues" secondary="custom fonts"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035932352
primary="@font-face rule" primary-sortas="font-face rule"
secondary="resources used by" data-type="indexterm"}font faces you call
upon, the more resources the web server has to hand over and the higher
the overall page weight will become. Most faces are not overly
large---usually 50 KB to 200 KB---but they add up quickly if you decide
to get fancy with your type, and truly complicated faces can be much
larger than 200 KB. You will have to balance appearance against
performance, leaning one way or the other depending on the
circumstances.

That said, just as []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035930624
primary="subsetting fonts" data-type="indexterm"}image optimization
tools are available, so are font optimization tools. Typically, these
are *subsetting* tools, which construct fonts using only the symbols
actually needed for display. If you're using a service like Adobe Fonts
or [Fonts.com](http://fonts.com), they probably have subsetting tools
available, or else do it dynamically when the font is requested.

When subsetting a font, you can use the `unicode-range` descriptor to
limit custom font use to only the characters in the font file. Services
such as Font Squirrel will subset the font for you and provide the
unicode range in the CSS snippet it produces. Just remember that
subsetting needs to be done in the font file, not just in the Unicode
range, in order to reduce the file size.

might want to use a custom font in very limited circumstances; for
example, to ensure that a font face is applied only to characters that
are in a specific language. In these cases, it can be useful to restrict
the use of a font to certain characters or symbols, and the
`unicode-range` descriptor allows precisely that.

```{=html}

  **Initial value**   U+0-10FFFF
  ------------------- -----------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
By default, the value of this descriptor covers U+0 to U+10FFFF, which
is the entirety of Unicode---meaning that if a font can supply the glyph
for a character, it will. Most of the time, this is exactly what you
want. For all the other times, you'll want to use specific font faces
for specific kinds of content. You can define a single code point, a
code-point range, or a set of ranges with the `?` wildcard character.

To pick a few examples from the CSS Fonts Module Level 3:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
unicode-range: U+0026; /* the Ampersand (&) character */
unicode-range: U+590-5FF;  /* Hebrew characters */
unicode-range: U+4E00-9FFF, U+FF00-FF9F, U+30??, U+A5;  /* Japanese
  kanji, hiragana, and katakana, plus the yen/yuan currency symbol*/
```

In the first case, a single code point is specified. The font will be
used only for the ampersand (&) character. If the ampersand is not used,
the font is not downloaded. If it is used, the entire font file is
downloaded. For this reason, it is sometimes good to optimize your font
files to include only characters in the specified Unicode range,
especially if, as in this case, you're using only one character from a
font that could contain several thousand characters.

In the second case, a single range is specified, spanning Unicode
character code point 590 through code point 5FF. This covers the 111
total characters used when writing Hebrew. Thus, an author might specify
a Hebrew font and restrict it to be used only for Hebrew characters,
even if the face contains glyphs for other code points:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "CMM-Ahuvah";
    src: url("cmm-ahuvah.otf" format("opentype");
    unicode-range: U+590-5FF;
}
```

In the third case, a series of ranges are specified in a comma-separated
list to cover all the Japanese characters. The interesting feature there
is the `U+30??` value, with a question mark, which is a special format
permitted in `unicode-range` values. The question marks are wildcards
meaning "any possible digit," making `U+30??` equivalent to
`U+3000-30FF`. The question mark is the only "special" character pattern
permitted in the value.

Ranges must always ascend. Any descending range, such as `U+400-300`, is
treated as a parsing error and ignored.

Because `@font-face` is designed to optimize
[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035788288 primary="lazy loading of font faces"
data-type="indexterm"}lazy loading, it's possible to use `unicode-range`
to download only the font faces a page actually needs, with possibly a
much smaller file size when using a font file optimized to contain only
the defined subset character range. If the page doesn't use any
character in the range, the font is not downloaded. If a single
character on a page requires a font, the whole font is downloaded.

Suppose you have a website that uses a mixture of English, Russian, and
basic mathematical operators, but you don't know which will appear on
any given page. A page could be all English, a mixture of Russian and
math, and so on. Furthermore, suppose you have special font faces for
all three types of content. You can make sure a user agent downloads
only the faces it needs with a properly constructed series of
`@font-face` rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "MyFont";
    src: url("myfont-general.otf" format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
    font-family: "MyFont";
    src: url("myfont-cyrillic.otf" format("opentype");
    unicode-range: U+04??, U+0500-052F, U+2DE0-2DFF, U+A640-A69F, U+1D2B-1D78;
}
@font-face {
    font-family: "MyFont";
    src: url("myfont-math.otf" format("opentype");
    unicode-range: U+22??;   /* equivalent to U+2200-22FF */
}

body {font-family: MyFont, serif;}
```

Because the first rule doesn't specify a Unicode range, the entire font
file is always downloaded---unless a page happens to contain no
characters at all (and maybe even then). The second rule causes
*myfont-cyrillic.otf* to be downloaded only if the page contains
characters in its declared Unicode range; the third rule does the same
for mathematical symbols.

If the content calls for the mathematical character U+2222 (∢, the
spherical angle character), *myfont-math.otf* will be downloaded and the
character from *myfont-math.otf* will be used, even if
*myfont-general.otf* has that character.

A more likely way to use this capability would be our ampersand example;
we can include a fancy ampersand from a cursive font and use it in place
of the ampersand found in a headline font. Something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Headline";
    src: url("headliner.otf" format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Headline";
    src: url("cursive-font.otf" format("opentype");
    unicode-range: U+0026;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {font-face: Headline, cursive;}
```

In a case like this, to keep page weights low, take a cursive font (that
you have the rights to use) and minimize it down to contain just the
ampersand character. You can use a tool like Font Squirrel to create a
single-character font file.

auto-translated version of the page into French or Swedish, for example,
could end up a mishmash of characters in different font faces, as the

primary="flash of unstyled content (FOUC)"
data-type="indexterm"}designer or developer of a certain vintage, you
may remember the days of the *flash of unstyled content* (*FOUC*). This
happened in earlier browsers that would load the HTML and display it to
the screen before the CSS was finished loading, or, at least, before the
layout of the page via CSS was finished.

A *flash of unstyled text* (*FOUT*) []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035573376
primary="FOUT (flash of unstyled text)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035526784
primary="flash of unstyled text (FOUT)" data-type="indexterm"}happens
when a browser has loaded the page and the CSS and then displays the
laid-out page, along with all the text, before it's done loading custom
fonts. FOUT causes text to appear in the default font, or a fallback
font, before being replaced by text using the custom-loaded font.

A cousin to this []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035525664
primary="FOIT (flash of invisible text)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035525056
primary="flash of invisible text (FOIT)" data-type="indexterm"}problem
is the *flash of invisible text* (*FOIT*). This user-agent solution to
FOUT is caused when the browser detects that text is set in a custom
font that hasn't loaded yet and makes the text invisible until the font
loads or a certain amount of time [has passed.]{.keep-together}

Since the replacement of text can change its size, whether via FOUT or
FOIT, take care when selecting fallback fonts. If a significant height
difference exists between the font used to initially display the text
and the custom font eventually loaded and used, significant page reflows
are likely to occur.

In an []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_disp_desc primary="font-display descriptor"

descriptor guides the browser to proceed with text rendering when a web

What we can call the *font-display timeline timer* starts when the user
agent first paints the page. The timeline is divided into three periods:
block, swap, and failure.

During the *font-block period*, if the font face is not loaded, the
browser renders any content that should use that font by using an
invisible fallback font face, meaning the text content is not visible
but the space is reserved. If the font loads successfully during the
block period, the text is rendered with the downloaded font and made
visible.

During the *swap period*, if the font face is not loaded, the browser
renders the content by using a visible fallback font face, most likely
one it has installed locally (e.g., Helvetica). If the font loads
successfully, the fallback font face is swapped to the downloaded font.

Once the *failure period* is entered, the user agent treats the
requested font as a failed load, falls back to an available font, and
will not swap the font if it does eventually load. If the swap period is
infinite, the failure period is never entered.

The values of the `font-display` descriptor match these periods of the
timeline, and their effect is to emphasize one part of the timeline at
the expense of the others. The effects are summarized in

Let's consider each value in turn:

`block`

:   Tells the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035481776
    primary="block keyword, font-display" data-type="indexterm"}browser
    to hold open space for the font for a few seconds (3 is what the
    specification recommends, but browsers may choose their own values),
    and then enters an infinitely long swap period. If the font ever
    finally loads, even if it's 10 minutes later, the fallback font that
    was used in its place will be replaced with the loaded font.

`swap`

:   Is similar, []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035479536
    primary="swap keyword, font-display" data-type="indexterm"}except it
    doesn't hold the space open for longer than a fraction of a second
    (100 milliseconds is the recommendation). A fallback font is then
    used, and is replaced with the intended font whenever it finally
    loads.

`fallback`

:   Gives the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035477248
    primary="fallback keyword, font-display" data-type="indexterm"}same
    brief block window that `swap` does, and then enters a short period
    in which the fallback font can be replaced by the intended font. If
    that short period (3 seconds is recommended) is exceeded, the
    fallback font is used indefinitely, and the user agent may cancel
    the download of the intended font since a swap will never
    [happen.]{.keep-together}

`optional`

:   Is the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797035473984
    primary="optional keyword, font-display" data-type="indexterm"}most
    stringent of them all: if the font isn't immediately available at

## Combining Descriptors {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1261}

Something that []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_face_combine
primary="@font-face rule" primary-sortas="font-face rule"
secondary="combining descriptors" data-type="indexterm"}might not be
immediately obvious is that you can supply multiple descriptors in order
to assign specific faces for specific property combinations. For
example, you can assign one face to bold text, another to italic text,
and a third to text that is both bold and italic.

This capability is implicit, as any undeclared descriptor is assigned
its default value. Let's consider a basic set of three face assignments,
using both descriptors we've covered and a few we'll get to in a bit:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
    font-stretch: normal;
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    font-weight: 500;
    font-style: normal;
    font-stretch: normal;
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Bold.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
    font-family: "Switzera";
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: italic;
    font-stretch: normal;
    src: url("SwitzeraADF-Italic.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

You may have noticed that we've explicitly declared some descriptors
with their default values, even though we didn't need to. The previous
example is exactly the same as a set of three rules in which we remove
every descriptor that shows a value of `normal`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-weight: 500;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-Bold.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-style: italic;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-Italic.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

In all three rules, no font-stretching occurs beyond the default
`normal` amount, and the values of `font-weight` and `font-style` vary
by which face is being assigned. So what if we want to assign a specific
face to unstretched text that's both bold and italic?

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-weight: bold;
   font-style: italic;
   font-stretch: normal;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-BoldItalic.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

And then what about bold, italic, condensed text?

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-weight: bold;
   font-style: italic;
   font-stretch: condensed;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-BoldCondItalic.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

How about normal-weight, italic, condensed text?

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-weight: normal;
   font-style: italic;
   font-stretch: condensed;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-CondItalic.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

We could keep this up for quite a while, but let's stop there. If we
take all those rules and strip out anything with a `normal` value, we
end up with the following result, illustrated in
[Figure 14-3](#ch14.xhtml_employing_a_variety_of_faces){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

If you declare `html { +font-family: switzera;}`, you don't have to
declare the font family again for additional selectors that use
`switzera`. The browser will use the correct font file for your bold,
italic, stretched, and normal text depending on your selector-specific
values for the `font-weight`, `font-style`, and `font-stretch` property
values.

The point is, we can have a specific font file for every weight, style,
and stretch. The ability to declare all the variations within a few
`@font-face` rules with a single `font-family` name ensures cohesive
typeface design and avoids font synthesis even when using nonvariable
fonts. Declaring all the variations of a font via `@font-face`, with the
same `font-family` descriptor name, reduces `font-family` property
overrides, reducing the chance of other developers on your team using
the wrong font file for a specific selector.

As you can see, when using standard fonts, a lot of possible
combinations exist just for those three descriptors---consider that
`font-stretch` has 10 possible values---but you'll likely never have to
run through them all. In fact, most font families don't have as many
faces as SwitzeraADF offers (24 at last count), so there wouldn't be
much point in writing out all the possibilities. Nevertheless, the
options are there, and in some cases you may find that you need to
assign, say, a specific face for bold condensed text so that the user
agent doesn't try to compute them for you. Or else use a variable font
that has weight and condensing axes.

Now that we've covered `@font-face` and provided an overview of a few
descriptors, let's get back to

```
The \<*`number`*\> value can be from `1` to `1000`, inclusive, where `1`
is the lightest and `1000` is the heaviest possible weight. Unless you
are using variable fonts, discussed later, limited weights are almost
always available for a font family (sometimes there is only a single
weight).

Generally speaking, the heavier a font weight becomes, the darker and
"more bold" a font appears. There are a great many ways to label a heavy
font face. For example, the font family known as SwitzeraADF has
variants such as SwitzeraADF Bold, SwitzeraADF Extra Bold, SwitzeraADF
Light, and SwitzeraADF Regular. All of these use the same basic font
shapes, but each has a different weight.

If the specified weight doesn't exist, a nearby weight is used.
[Table 14-5](#ch14.xhtml_weight_mappings){data-type="xref"} lists the
numbers used for each of the commonly accepted font weight labels, as
defined in the `"wght"` variation axis. If a font has only two weights
corresponding to `400` and `700` (normal and bold), any number value for
`font-weight` will be mapped to the closest value. Thus, any
`font-weight` value from `1` through `550` will be mapped to `400`, and
any value greater than `550` up through `1000` will be mapped to `700`.

Let's say that you want to use SwitzeraADF for a document but would like
to make use of all those heaviness levels. If your user has all the font
files locally on their machine and you didn't use `@font-face` to rename
all the options to `Switzera`, you could refer to them directly through
the `font-family` property---but you really shouldn't have to do that.
It's no fun having to write a stylesheet like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-family: 'SwitzeraADF Extra Bold', sans-serif;}
h2 {font-family: 'SwitzeraADF Bold', sans-serif;}
h3 {font-family: 'SwitzeraADF Bold', sans-serif;}
h4, p {font-family: 'SwitzeraADF Regular', sans-serif;}
small {font-family: 'SwitzeraADF Light', sans-serif;}
```

That's pretty tedious. This is a perfect example of why specifying a
single font family for the whole document and then assigning different
weights to various elements by using `@font-face` is so powerful: you
can include several `@font-face` declarations, each with the same
`font-family` name, but with various values for the `font-weight`
descriptors. Then you can use different font files with fairly simple
`font-weight` declarations:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
strong {font-weight: bold;}
b {font-weight: bolder;}
```

The first declaration says the `<strong>` element should be displayed
using a bold font face or, to put it another way, a font face that is
heavier than the normal font face. The second declaration says `<b>`
should use a font face that is the inherited `font-weight` value [plus
100.]{.keep-together}

What's really happening behind the scenes is that heavier faces of the
font are used for displaying `<strong>` and `<b>` elements. Thus, if you
display a paragraph using Times, and part of it is bold, then two faces
of the same font are really in use: Times and TimesBold. The regular
text is displayed using Times, and the bold and bolder text are
displayed using TimesBold.

If the font doesn't have a boldfaced version, it may be synthesized by
the browser, creating a faux bold. (To prevent this, use
`font-synthesis` property, which is described later.)

## How Weights Work {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1265}

To understand how a user agent determines the heaviness, or weight, of a
given font variant (not to mention how weight is inherited), it's
easiest to start by talking about the values `1` through `1000`
inclusive, specifically the values divisible by 100, `100` through
`900`. These number values were defined to map to a relatively common
feature of font design that gives a font nine levels of weight. If a
nonvariable font family has faces for all nine weight levels available,
the numbers are mapped directly to the predefined levels, with `100` as
the lightest variant of the font and `900` as the heaviest.

In fact, these numbers have no intrinsic weight. The CSS specification
says only that each number corresponds to a weight at least as heavy as
the number that precedes it. Thus, `100`, `200`, `300`, and `400` might
all map to a single relatively lightweight variant; `500` and `600`
could correspond to a single medium-heavy font variant; and `700`,
`800`, and `900` could all produce the same very heavy font variant. As
long as no number corresponds to a variant that is lighter than the
variant assigned to the previous lower number, everything will be all
right.

When it comes to nonvariable fonts, these numbers are defined to be
equivalent to certain common variant names. The value `400` is defined
to be equivalent to `normal`, and `700` corresponds to `bold`.

A user agent has to do some calculations if a font family has fewer than
nine weights. In this case, the user agent must fill in the gaps in a
predetermined way:

-   If the value `500` is unassigned, it is given the same font weight
    as that assigned to `400`.

-   If `300` is unassigned, it is given the next variant lighter than
    `400`. If no lighter variant is available, `300` is assigned the
    same variant as `400`. In this case, it will usually be Normal or
    Medium. This method is also used for `200` and `100`.

-   If `600` is unassigned, it is given the next variant darker than
    that assigned for `500`. If no darker variant is available, `600` is
    assigned the same variant as `500`. This method is also used for
    `700`, `800`, and `900`.

To illustrate this weighting scheme more clearly, let's look at a couple
of examples. In the first example, assume that the font family Karrank%
is an OpenType font, so it has nine weights already defined. In this
case, the numbers are assigned to each level, and the keywords `normal`
and `bold` are assigned to the numbers `400` and `700`, respectively.

In our second example, consider the font family SwitzeraADF.
Hypothetically, its variants might be assigned numeric values for
`font-weight`, as shown in
[Table 14-6](#ch14.xhtml_hypothetical_weight_assignments_for_a_sp){data-type="xref"}.

  Font face                Assigned keyword   Assigned number(s)
  ------------------------ ------------------ ---------------------
  SwitzeraADF Light                           `100` through `300`
  SwitzeraADF Regular      `normal`           `400`
  SwitzeraADF Medium                          `500`
  SwitzeraADF Bold         `bold`             `600` through `700`
  SwitzeraADF Extra Bold                      `800` through `900`

  : [Table 14-6. ]{.label}Hypothetical weight assignments for a specific
  font family {#hypothetical_weight_assignments_for_a_sp}

The first three number values are assigned to the lightest weight. The
Regular face gets the keyword `normal` and the number weight `400`.
Since there is a Medium font, it's assigned to the number `500`. There
is nothing to assign to `600`, so it's mapped to the Bold font face,
which is also the variant to which `700` and `bold` are assigned.
Finally, `800` and `900` are assigned to the Black and Ultra Black
variants, respectively. Note that this last assignment would happen only
if those faces had the top two weight levels already assigned.
Otherwise, the user agent might ignore them and assign `800` and `900`
to the Bold face instead, or it might assign them both to one or the
other of the Black variants.

The `font-weight` property is inherited, so if you set a paragraph to be
`bold`

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.one {font-weight: bold;}
```

then all of its children will inherit that boldness, as we see in
[Figure 14-4](#ch14.xhtml_inherited_font-weight){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>

</div>
</figure>

This isn't unusual, but the situation gets interesting when you use the
last two values we have to discuss: `bolder` and `lighter`. In general
terms, these keywords have the effect you'd anticipate: they make text
more or less bold compared to its parent's font weight. How they do so
is slightly complicated. First, let's consider `bolder`.

If you set an element to have a weight of `bolder` or `lighter`, the
user agent first must determine what `font-weight` value was inherited
from the parent element. Once it has that number (say, `400`), it then
changes the value as shown in
[Table 14-7](#ch14.xhtml_bolder_and_lighter_weight_mappings){data-type="xref"}.

  Inherited value      `bolder`    `lighter`
  -------------------- ----------- -----------
  value \< 100         400         No change
  100 ≤ value \< 350   400         100
  350 ≤ value \< 550   700         100
  550 ≤ value \< 750   900         400
  750 ≤ value \< 900   900         700
  900 ≤ value          No change   700

  : [Table 14-7. ]{.label}`bolder` and `lighter` weight mappings
  {#bolder_and_lighter_weight_mappings}

Thus, you might encounter the following situations, illustrated in
[Figure 14-5](#ch14.xhtml_text_trying_to_be_bolder){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-weight: normal;}
p em {font-weight: bolder;}  /* inherited value '400', evaluates to '700' */

h1 {font-weight: bold;}
h1 b {font-weight: bolder;}  /* inherited value '700', evaluates to '900' */

div {font-weight: 100;}
div strong {font-weight: bolder;} /* inherited value '100', evaluates to '400' */
```

<h6 id="ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1267"><span class="label">Figure 14-5.
</span>Text trying to be bolder</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first example, the user agent moves up from `400` to `700`. In
the second example, `<h1>` text is already set to `bold`, which equates
to `700`. If no bolder face is available, the user agent sets the weight
of `<b>` text within an `<h1>` to `900`, since that is the next step up
from `700`. Since `900` is assigned to the same font face as `700`, no
visible difference exists between normal `<h1>` text and bold `<h1>`
text, but the weight values are different [nonetheless.]{.keep-together}

As you might expect, `lighter` works in much the same way, except it
causes the user agent to move down the weight scale instead of up.

## The font-weight Descriptor {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1268}

With the `font-weight` descriptor, []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_weight_desc

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_face_weight

assign faces of varying weights to the weighting levels permitted by the
`font-weight` property. The allowable values are different for the
descriptor, which supports `auto`, `normal`, `bold`, or one to two
numeric values as a range. Neither `lighter` nor `bolder` are supported.

For example, the following rules explicitly assign five faces to six
`font-weight` values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-weight: 1 250;

}
@font-face {

   font-weight: normal;
   src: url("f/SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-weight: 500 600;
   src: url("f/SwitzeraADF-DemiBold.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {

   font-weight: bold;

   font-weight: 800 1000;
   src: url("f/SwitzeraADF-ExtraBold.otf") format("opentype");

With these faces assigned, the author now has multiple weighting levels
available for their use, as illustrated in

In any given situation, the user agent picks which face to use depending
on the exact value of a `font-weight` property, using the resolution
algorithm detailed in ["How Weights
Work"](#ch14.xhtml_how_weights_work){data-type="xref"}. While the
`font-weight` property has numerous keyword values, the `font-weight`
descriptor accepts only `normal` and `bold` as keywords, and any number

What can be a real head-scratcher at first is that different fonts
declared to be the same size may not appear to be the same size. This is
because the actual relation of the `font-size` property to what you see
rendered is determined by the font's designer.
[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797034157040 primary="boxes"
secondary="em box (em square)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797034156064
primary="character box (em box)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797034155392
primary="em box (em square)" data-type="indexterm"}This relationship is
set as an *em square* (some call it an *em box*) within the font itself.
This em square (and thus the font size) doesn't have to refer to any
boundaries established by the characters in a font. Instead, it refers
to the distance between baselines when the font is set without any extra
leading (`line-height` in CSS).

The effect of `font-size` is to provide a size for the em box of a given
font. This does not guarantee that any of the displayed characters will
be this size. It is quite possible for fonts to have characters that are
taller than the default distance between baselines. For that matter, a
font might be defined such that all of its characters are smaller than
its em square, as many fonts are.

## Using Relative Sizes {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1276}

Just as `font-weight` has the []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_size_prop_rel
primary="font-size property" secondary="relative sizes"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_ix_rel_font_size
primary="relative font sizes" data-type="indexterm"}keywords `bolder`
and `lighter`, the `font-size` property has relative-size keywords
called `larger` and `smaller`. Much as with relative font weights, these
keywords cause the computed value of `font-size` to move up and down a
scale of size values.

The `larger` and `smaller` keywords are fairly straightforward: they
cause the size of an element to be shifted up or down the absolute-size
scale, relative to their parent element:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: medium;}
strong, em {font-size: larger;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>This paragraph element contains <strong>a strong-emphasis element,
which itself contains <em>an emphasis element, which also contains
<strong>a strong element.</strong></em></strong></p>

<p> medium <strong>large <em> x-large <strong>xx-large</strong> </em> </strong>
    </p>
```

Unlike the relative values for weight, the relative-size values are not
necessarily constrained to the limits of the absolute-size range. Thus,
a font's size can be pushed beyond the sizes for `xx-small` and
`xxx-large`. If the parent element `font-size` is the largest or
smallest absolute value, the browser will use a scaling factor between
1.2 and 1.5 to create an even smaller or larger font size. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-size: xxx-large;}
em {font-size: larger;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>A Heading with <em>Emphasis</em> added</h1>
<p>This paragraph has some <em>emphasis</em> as well.</p>
```

As you can see in
[Figure 14-9](#ch14.xhtml_relative_font_sizing_at_the_edges_of_the){data-type="xref"},
the emphasized text in the `<h1>` element is slightly larger than
`xxx-large`. The amount of scaling is left up to the user agent, with a
scaling factor in the range of 1.2 to 1.5 being preferred, but not
required. The `em` text in the paragraph is shifted up one slot to 140%.

relative-size keywords. A percentage value is always computed in terms
of whatever size is inherited from an element's parent. Unlike the size
keywords previously discussed, percentages permit much finer control
over the computed font size. Consider the following example, illustrated
in

In this example, the exact pixel-size values are shown. These are the
values calculated by the browser, regardless of the displayed size of
the characters onscreen, which may have been rounded to the nearest
whole number of pixels.

When using []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033621248 primary="font-size property"
secondary="length units for" data-type="indexterm"}em measurements, the
same principles apply as with percentages, such as the inheritance of
computed sizes and so forth. CSS defines the length value `em` to be
equivalent to percentage values, in the sense that `1em` is the same as
`100%` when sizing fonts. Thus, the following would yield identical
results, assuming that both paragraphs have the same parent element:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.one {font-size: 166%;}
p.two {font-size: 1.66em;}
```

As with the relative-size keywords, percentages are effectively
cumulative. Thus, the following markup is displayed as shown in
[Figure 14-11](#ch14.xhtml_the_issues_of_inheritance){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: 12px;}

strong {font-size: 135%;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>This paragraph contains both <em>emphasis and <strong>strong
emphasis</strong></em>, both of which are larger than the paragraph text. </p>

The size value for the `<strong>` element shown in

is computed as follows:

-   12 px × 120% = 14.4 px + 14.4 px × 135% = 19.44 px

The problem of runaway scaling can go the other direction, too. Imagine
the effect of the following rule on a nested list item if we have lists
nested four levels deep:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {font-size: 80%;}
```

The unordered list nested four levels deep would have a computed
`font-size` value 40.96% the size of the parent of the top-level list.
Every nested list would have a font size 80% as big as its parent list,
causing each level to become harder and harder to
read.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033483344 primary=""

are its size and its *x-height*, which is the height of a lowercase *x*
character in the font. The number that results from dividing the
x-height by the `font-size` is referred to as the *aspect value*. Fonts
with higher aspect values tend to remain legible as the font's size is
reduced; conversely, fonts with low aspect values become illegible more
quickly. CSS provides a way to deal with shifts in aspect values between
font families, as well as ways to use different metrics to compute an
aspect value, with the property `font-size-adjust`.

```
The goal of this property is to preserve legibility when the font used
is not the author's first choice. Because of the differences in font
appearance, one font may be legible at a certain size, while another
font at the same size is difficult or impossible to read.

The property value can be `none`, `from-font`, or a number. The number
specified should generally be the aspect value (the ratio of a given
font metric to font size) of the first-choice font family. To pick the
font metric used to compute the aspect ratio, you can add a keyword
specifying it. If not included, it defaults to `ex-height`, which
normalizes the aspect value of the fonts using the x-height divided by
the font size.

The other possibilities for the font metric keyword are as follows:

`cap-height`

:   Use the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033394416
    primary="cap-height metric keyword" data-type="indexterm"}cap-height
    (height of capital letters) of the font.

`ch-width`

:   Use the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033392176
    primary="ch-width metric keyword" data-type="indexterm"}horizontal
    pitch (also the width of `1ch`) of the font.

`ic-width`

:   Use the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033389456
    primary="ic-width metric keyword" data-type="indexterm"}width of the
    font using the CJK water ideograph, "水" (U+6C34) of the font.

`ic-height`

:   Use the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033387248
    primary="ic-height metric keyword" data-type="indexterm"}height of
    the ideograph "水" (U+6C34) of the font.

Declaring `font-size-adjust: none` will suppress any adjustment of font
sizes. This is the default state.

The `from-font` keyword directs the user agent to use the built-in value
of the specified font metric from the first available font, rather than
requiring the author to figure out what that value is and write it
explicitly. Thus, writing `font-size-adjust: cap-height from-font` will
automatically set an aspect value by dividing the cap-height by the
em-square height.

A good example is to compare the common fonts Verdana and Times.
Consider
[Figure 14-12](#ch14.xhtml_comparing_verdana_and_times){data-type="xref"}
and the following markup, which shows both fonts at a `font-size` of
`10px`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-size: 10px;}
p.cl1 {font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;}
p.cl2 {font-family: Times, serif; }
```

<h6 id="ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1284"><span class="label">Figure 14-12.
</span>Comparing Verdana and Times</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The text in Times is much harder to read than the Verdana text. This is
partly due to the limitations of pixel-based display, but it is also
because Times becomes harder to read at smaller font sizes.

As it turns out, the ratio of x-height to character size in Verdana is
0.58, whereas in Times it is 0.46. To make these font faces look more
consistent with each other, you can declare the aspect value of Verdana,
and have the user agent adjust the size of the text that's actually
used. This is accomplished using the following formula:

-   Declared `font-size` ×\
    (`font-size-adjust` value ÷ aspect\
    value of available font) = Adjusted `font-size`

So, when Times is used instead of Verdana, the adjustment is as follows:

-   `10px` × (`0.58` ÷ `0.46`) = `12.6px`

This leads to the result shown in
[Figure 14-13](#ch14.xhtml_adjusting_times){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font: 10px Verdana, sans-serif; font-size-adjust: ex-height 0.58;}
p.cl2 {font-family: Times, serif; }
```

</span>Adjusting Times</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The catch is that for a user agent to intelligently make size
adjustments, it first has to know the aspect value of the fonts you
specify. User agents that support `@font-face` will be able to pull that
information directly from the font file, assuming the files contain the
information---any professionally produced font should, but there's no
guarantee. If a font file doesn't contain the aspect value, a user agent
may try to compute it; but again, there's no guarantee that they will or
even can.

If the user agent can't find or figure out aspect values on its own, the
`auto` value for `font-size-adjust` is a way of getting the desired
effect even if you don't know the actual aspect value of your
first-choice font. For example, assuming that the user agent can
determine that the aspect value of Verdana is 0.58, the following will
have the same result as that shown in
[Figure 14-13](#ch14.xhtml_adjusting_times){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font: 10px Verdana, sans-serif; font-size-adjust: auto;}

want the fallback font scaled so it better matches the primary font
selected. That percentage is used as a multiplier for the glyph outline
sizes and other metrics of the font:

```
The default value of `font-style` is `normal`. This value refers to
*upright* text, which is best described as text that is not italic or
otherwise slanted. For instance, the vast majority of text in this book
is upright.

Italic []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033108128 primary="italic keyword, fonts"
data-type="indexterm"}font faces are usually a bit cursive in
appearance, and generally use less horizontal space than the `normal`
version of the same font. In standard fonts, italic text is a separate
font face, with small changes made to the structure of each letter to
account for the altered appearance. This is especially true of serif
fonts because, in addition to the text characters "leaning," the serifs
may be altered. Font faces with labels like `Italic`, `Cursive`, and
`Kursiv` are usually mapped to the `italic` keyword.

*Oblique text*, on the other []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797033104464
primary="oblique font style" data-type="indexterm"}hand, is a slanted
version of the normal, upright text. Oblique text is generally not
altered from the upright text other than being given a slope. If a font
has oblique versions, they are often in faces with labels such as
`Oblique`, `Slanted`, and `Incline`.

When fonts don't have italic or oblique versions, the browser can
simulate italic and oblique fonts by artificially sloping the glyphs of
the regular face. (To prevent this from happening, use
`font-synthesis: none`, covered later in the chapter.)

Italic and oblique text at the same angle are not the same: italic is
stylized and usually obsessively designed, and oblique is merely
slanted. By default, if `oblique` is declared without an angle, a value
of `14deg` is used.

When oblique is given an angle, such as `font-style: oblique 25deg`, the
browser selects the face classified as oblique, if available. If one or
more oblique faces are available in the chosen font family, the one most
closely matching the specified angle by the `font-style` descriptor is
chosen. If no oblique faces are available, the browser may synthesize an
oblique version of the font by slanting a normal face by the specified
angle.

Unless further limited by the font or the descriptor, the oblique angle
specified must be between `90deg` and `-90deg`, inclusive. If the given
value is outside those limits, the declaration is ignored. Positive
values are slanted toward the end (inline-end) of the line, while
negative values are slanted toward the beginning (inline-start) of the
line.

To visualize the difference between italic and oblique text, refer to
[Figure 14-14](#ch14.xhtml_italic_and_oblique_text_in_detail){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch14.xhtml_italic_and_oblique_text_in_detail" class="figure">

</span>Italic and oblique text in detail</h6>
</div>
</figure>

For TrueType or OpenType variable fonts, the `"slnt"` variation axis is
used to implement varying slant angles for oblique, and the `"ital"`
variation axis with a value of `1` is used to implement italic values.
See ["Font Variation
Settings"](#ch14.xhtml_font-variation-settings){data-type="xref"} for
more details.

If you want to make sure that a document uses italic text in familiar
ways, you could write a stylesheet like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-style: normal;}
em, i {font-style: italic;}
```

These styles would make paragraphs use an upright font, as usual, and
cause the `<em>` and `<i>` elements to use an italic font, also as
usual. On the other hand, you might decide that there should be a subtle
difference between `<em>` and `<i>`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-style: normal;}
em {font-style: oblique;}
i {font-style: italic;}
b {font-style: oblique -8deg;}
```

If you look closely at
[Figure 14-15](#ch14.xhtml_more_font_styles){data-type="xref"}, you'll
see no apparent difference between the `<em>` and `<i>` elements. In
practice, not every font is so sophisticated as to have both an italic
face and an oblique face, and even fewer web browsers are sophisticated
enough to tell the difference when both faces do exist.

The equivalent `font-variation-settings` setting for `italic` is
`"ital"`. For the `oblique <`*`angle`*`>` value, the equivalent is
`"slnt"`, which is used to vary between upright and slanted text. Just
as with `font-style`, the slant axis is interpreted as the angle of
slant in counterclockwise degrees from upright: inline-start-leaning
oblique design will have a negative slant value, whereas
inline-end-leaning needs a positive value.

secondary="styles" data-type="indexterm"}assign very particular faces of
Switzera to the various kinds of `font-style` property values. Given the
following, the result would be to render `<h2>` and `<h3>` elements
using SwitzeraADF-Italic instead of SwitzeraADF-Regular, as illustrated
in
[Figure 14-16](#ch14.xhtml_using_declared_font-style_faces){data-type="xref"}:

Ideally, if a SwitzeraADF face with an oblique typeface existed, a page
author could point to it instead of the italic variant. There isn't such
a face, though, so the author mapped the italic face to both the
`italic` and `oblique` values. As with `font-weight`, the `font-style`
descriptor can take all of the values of the `font-style` property
*except* for `inherit`.

Oblique []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032906944 primary="oblique font style"
data-type="indexterm"}text changes the angle of letterforms without
performing any kind of character substitution. Any variable font that
supports oblique text also supports normal or upright text: upright text
is oblique text at a `0deg` angle. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
  font-family: "varFont";
  src: url("aVariableFont.woff2") format("woff2-variations");
  font-weight: 1 1000;
  font-stretch: 75% 100%;
  font-style: oblique 0deg 20deg;
  font-display: swap;
}

body { font-family: varFont, sans-serif; font-style: oblique 0deg; }
em { font-style: oblique 14deg; }
```

The angle given in the CSS value `oblique 3deg` is a clockwise slant of
3 degrees. Positive angles are clockwise slants, whereas negative angles
are counterclockwise slants. If no angle is included, it is the same as
writing `oblique 14deg`. The degree angle can be any value between
`-90deg` and `90deg`, inclusive.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032762320

In some []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_stretch_prop
primary="font-stretch property" data-type="indexterm"}font families,
variant faces have wider or narrower letterforms. These often take names
like Condensed, Wide, and Ultra Expanded. The utility of such variants
is that a designer can use a single font family while also having skinny
and fat variants. CSS provides a property that allows an author to
select among such variants, when they exist, without having to
explicitly define them in `font-family` declarations. It does this via
the somewhat misleadingly named `font-stretch`.

You might expect from the property name that `font-stretch` will stretch
or squeeze a font like saltwater taffy, but that's not the case. This
property instead behaves very much like the absolute-size keywords
(e.g., `xx-large`) for the `font-size` property. You can set a
percentage between 50% and 200% inclusive, or use a range of keyword
values that have defined percentage equivalents.
[Table 14-9](#ch14.xhtml_font_stretch_keyword_mapping){data-type="xref"}
shows the mapping between keyword values and numeric percentages.

  Keyword             Percentage
  ------------------- ------------
  `ultra-condensed`   50%
  `extra-condensed`   62.5%
  `condensed`         75%
  `semi-condensed`    87.5%
  `normal`            100%
  `semi-expanded`     112.5%
  `expanded`          125%
  `extra-expanded`    150%
  `ultra-expanded`    200%

  : [Table 14-9. ]{.label}Percentage equivalents for `font-stretch`
  keyword values {#font_stretch_keyword_mapping}

For example, you might decide to stress the text in a strongly
emphasized element by changing the font characters to a wider face than
its parent element's font characters.

The catch is that this property works only if the font family in use
actually *has* wider and narrower faces, which mostly come with only
expensive traditional fonts. (They're much more widely available in
variable fonts.)

For example, consider the common font Verdana, which has only one width
face; this is equivalent to `font-stretch: normal`. Declaring the
following will have no effect on the width of the displayed text:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-family: Verdana;}
strong {font-stretch: extra-expanded;}
footer {font-stretch: extra-condensed;}
```

All of the text will be at Verdana's usual width. However, if the font
family is changed to one that has multiple width faces, such as Futura,
things will be different, as shown in
[Figure 14-17](#ch14.xhtml_stretching_font_characters){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-family: Verdana;}
strong {font-stretch: extra-expanded;}
footer {font-stretch: extra-condensed;}
```

For variable fonts that support the `"wdth"` axis, set the width in
`font-variation-settings` to a value greater than 0. This controls the
glyph width or stroke thickness, depending on the font
design.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032592928 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_face_stretch
primary="@font-face rule" primary-sortas="font-face rule"
secondary="stretching fonts" data-type="indexterm"}as with the
`font-weight` descriptor, the `font-stretch` descriptor allows you to
explicitly assign faces of varying widths to the width values permitted
in the `font-stretch` property. For example, the following rules
explicitly assign three faces to the most directly analogous
`font-stretch` values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-stretch: normal;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-stretch: condensed;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-Cond.otf") format("opentype");
}
@font-face {
   font-family: "Switzera";
   font-stretch: expanded;
   src: url("SwitzeraADF-Ext.otf") format("opentype");
}
```

In a parallel to what you saw in previous sections, you can call on
these different width faces through the `font-stretch` property, as
illustrated in
[Figure 14-18](#ch14.xhtml_using_declared_font-stretch_faces){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, h2, h3 {font-family: SwitzeraADF, Helvetica, sans-serif;}
h1 {font-size: 225%;}
h2 {font-size: 180%; font-stretch: condensed;}
h3 {font-size: 150%; font-stretch: expanded;}
```

</div>
</figure>

If you use a variable font that contains the full spectrum of
font-stretch sizing, you can import a single font file with
`@font-face`, then use it for all of your text font-stretch
requirements. This produces the same degree of horizontal stretching
shown in
[Figure 14-18](#ch14.xhtml_using_declared_font-stretch_faces){data-type="xref"},
albeit with a different font:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'League Mono Var';
  src: url('LeagueMonoVariable.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-stretch: 50% 200%;
  font-display: swap;
}

h1, h2, h3 {font-family: "League Mono Var", Helvetica, sans-serif;}
h2 {font-size: 180%; font-stretch: 75%;}
h3 {font-size: 150%; font-stretch: 125%;}
```

The `font-stretch` descriptor can take all of the values of the
`font-stretch` property *except* for `inherit`.

If you do want to use a different font for your variable fonts depending
on whether the text is extended or condensed, use the `"wdth"` value in
the comma-separated value of the `@font-face` `font-variation-settings`
descriptor, as in the following example:[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032281008

# Font Synthesis {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1301}

Sometimes a given font family will lack alternate faces for options like
bold or italic text or small capital letters. In such situations, the
user agent may attempt to synthesize a face from the faces it has
available, but this can lead to unattractive letterforms. To address
this, []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032233408 primary="synthesizing fonts"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032232816 primary="fonts"

`font-synthesis`, which lets you say how much synthesis you will or
won't permit in the rendering of a page.
[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032231216 primary="font-synthesis property"

it has bearing on all the font variants to follow, so we're dealing with
it now.

In many user agents, a font family that has no bold face can have one
computed for it. This might be done by adding pixels to either side of
each character glyph, for example. While this might seem useful, it can
lead to results that are visually unappealing, especially at smaller
font sizes. This is why most font families have bold faces included: the
font's designer wanted to make sure that bolded text in that font looked
good.

Similarly, a font family that lacks an italic face can have one
synthesized by simply slanting the characters in the normal face. This
tends to look even worse than synthesized bold faces, particularly when
it comes to serif fonts. Compare the difference between the actual
italic face included in Georgia and a synthesized italic version of
Georgia (which we're calling "oblique" here), illustrated in
[Figure 14-19](#ch14.xhtml_synthesized_versus_designed_italics){data-type="xref"}.

In supporting user agents, declaring `font-synthesis: none` blocks the
user agent from doing any such synthesis for the affected elements. You
can block it for the whole document with `html {font-synthesis: none;}`,
for example. The downside is that any attempts to create variant text
using a font that doesn't offer the appropriate faces will stay the
normal face, instead of even approximating what was intended. The upside
is that you don't have to worry about a user agent trying to synthesize
those variants and doing a poor job of it.

This []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032154624 primary="CSS1 specification"
secondary="fonts" data-type="indexterm"}property is shorthand for five
separate properties, which we'll get to in just a moment. The most
common values you'll find in the wild are `normal`, which is the default
and describes ordinary text, and `small-caps`, which has existed since
CSS1.

First, however, let's cover the two values that don't correspond to
other properties:

`none`

:   Disables all variants of any kind by setting
    `font-feature-ligatures` to `none` and all the other font variant
    properties to `normal`

`normal`

:   Disables most variants by setting all the font variant properties,
    including `font-feature-ligatures`, to `normal`

Understanding the variant aspect of `small-caps` might help explain the
idea of variants, making all the other properties easier to understand.
The `small-caps` value calls for the use of small caps
(`font-feature-settings: "smcp"`). Instead of upper- and lowercase
letters, a small-caps font employs capital letters of different sizes.
Thus, you might see something like what's shown in
[Figure 14-20](#ch14.xhtml_the_small-caps_value_in_use){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font-variant: small-caps;}
h1 code, p {font-variant: normal;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>The Uses of <code>font-variant</code></h1>

</span>The <code>small-caps</code> value in use</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As you may notice, in the display of the `<h1>` element, there is a
larger capital letter wherever an uppercase letter appears in the
source, and a small capital letter wherever there is a lowercase letter
in the source. This is very similar to `text-transform: uppercase`, with
the only real difference being that, here, the capital letters are of
different sizes. However, the reason that `small-caps` is declared using
a font property is that some fonts have a specific small-caps face,
which a font property is used to select.

What happens if no font-face variant, such as `small-caps`, exists? The
specification provides two options. The first is for the user agent to
create a small-caps face by scaling capital letters on its own. The
second is to make all letters uppercase and the same size, exactly as if
the declaration `text-transform: uppercase` had been used instead. This
is not an ideal solution but it is permitted.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1307}

Bear in mind that not every font supports every variant. For example,
most Latin fonts won't support any of the East Asian variants. In
addition, not every font will include support for, say, some of the
numeric and ligature variants. Many fonts will support *none* of the
variants.

To find out what a given font supports, you have to consult its
documentation, or do a lot of testing if no documentation is available.
Most commercial fonts do come with documentation, and most free fonts
don't. Fortunately, some browser developer tools (not including Chromium
browsers, as of late 2022) have a tab that provides information about
font variants and feature settings.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032080096

    the result is likely to be the same as for `small-caps`.

    primary="titling-caps keyword, font-variant-caps"

:   The []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797032009424

The following code is illustrated in

another:

Why did we fake some of the examples in
[Figure 14-21](#ch14.xhtml_different_types_of_capital_variants){data-type="xref"}?
In part, because finding a single font that contains all the capital
variants is exceedingly difficult, and it is literally faster to fake
some results than dig up a font, or set of fonts, that might work.

We also want to highlight that exact situation: most of the time, you're
going to get either a fallback (as from `petite-caps` to `small-caps`)
or no variant at all. []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031908720

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031907632
primary="font-variant descriptor, @font-face"
data-type="indexterm"}Because of this, make sure to use the `@font-face`
`font-variant` descriptor to define what should happen. Otherwise, if a
`font-variant-caps` category variant is not available, the browser will
decide how to render it. For example, if `petite-caps` is specified and
the font doesn't have a petite-caps face or variable axis defined, the
user agent may render the text using small capital glyphs. If small
capital glyphs are not included in the font, the browser may synthesize
them by proportionally shrinking uppercase glyphs.

Alternatively, you can use `{font-synthesis: none;}` to prevent the
browser from synthesizing the text. You can also include
`{font-synthesis: small-caps;}`, or omit `font-synthesis` altogether, to
allow a small-caps typeface to be synthesized if needed.

Fonts sometimes include special glyphs for various caseless characters
like punctuation marks to match the cap-variant text. The browser will
not synthesize caseless characters on its
own.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031903168 primary=""

The default value, `normal`, means that nothing special will be done
when rendering numbers. They'll just appear the same as they usually do
for the font face.
[Figure 14-22](#ch14.xhtml_different_types_of_numeric_variants){data-type="xref"}
demonstrates all the values, and as before, the examples marked with a
dagger (†) were faked in one way or another because fonts lacked those
features.

Perhaps the simplest numeric variant is `slashed-zero`. This causes the
numeral 0 to appear with a slash through it, most likely on a diagonal.
Slashed zeros are often the default rendering in monospace fonts, where
distinguishing 0 from the capital letter *O* can be difficult.
[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031852656
primary="slashed-zero numeric display keyword" data-type="indexterm"} In
serif and sans-serif fonts, they are usually not the default appearance
of zeros. Setting `font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero` will bring out a
slashed zero if one is available.

Speaking of []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031850880
primary="diagonal-fractions numeric display keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}diagonal slashes, the value `diagonal-fractions`
causes characters arranged as a fraction (e.g., 1/2) to be rendered as
smaller numbers, the first raised up, separated by a diagonal slash. The
`stacked-fractions` value renders the fraction as the first number above
the second, and the two separated by a horizontal slash.

If the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031848416
primary="ordinal numeric display keyword" data-type="indexterm"}font has
features for ordinal labels, like the letters following the numbers of
1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in English, `ordinal` enables the use of those
special glyphs. These will generally look like superscripted, smaller
versions of the letters.

Authors can []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031846656
primary="lining-nums numeric display keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031845952
primary="oldstyle-nums numeric display keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}affect the figures used for numbers with
`lining-nums`, which sets all numbers on the baseline; and
`oldstyle-nums`, which enables numbers like 3, 4, 7, and 9 to descend
below the baseline. Georgia is a common example of a font that has
old-style numbers.

You can also influence the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031843696

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031841952
primary="tabular-nums numeric display keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}sizing of figures used for numbers. The
`proportional-nums` value enables the numbers to be proportional, as in
proportional fonts; and `tabular-nums` gives all numbers the same width,
as in monospace fonts. The advantage of these values is that you can,
assuming there are glyphs to support them in the font face, get the
monospace effect in proportional fonts without converting the numbers to
a monospace face, and similarly cause monospace numbers to be sized
proportionally.

You can include multiple values, but only one value from each of the
numeric-value sets:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'mathVariableFont';
  src: local("math");

`common-ligatures`

:   Enables[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031689600
    primary="common-ligatures keyword" data-type="indexterm"} the use of
    common ligatures, such as those combining *f* or *t* with letters
    that follow them. In French, the sequence *oe* is more usually
    rendered using the ligature *œ*. Browsers usually have these enabled
    by default, so if you want to disable them, use
    `no-common-ligatures` instead.

`discretionary-ligatures`

:   Enables[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031685344
    primary="discretionary-ligatures keyword" data-type="indexterm"} the
    use of special ligatures created by font designers that are unusual
    or otherwise not regarded as common.

`historical-ligatures`

:   Enables[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031682976
    primary="historical-ligatures keyword" data-type="indexterm"} the
    use of historical ligatures, which are generally those found in the
    typography of centuries past but are not used today. For example, in
    German the *tz* digraph used to be rendered as
    ![](./images/tz_italic.png){height="50" width="50"}.

`contextual-ligatures`

:   Enables[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031679760
    primary="contextual-ligatures keyword" data-type="indexterm"} the
    use of ligatures that appear based on context, such as a cursive
    font enabling connecting curves from one letter to the next
    depending on not just the character that follows, but possibly also
    what characters came before. These are also sometimes used in
    programming fonts, where sequences like `!=` may be rendered as `≠`
    instead.

`no-common-ligatures`

:   Explicitly[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031676624

    disables the use of contextual ligatures.

The default value, `normal`, turns off all these ligatures *except*
common ligatures, which are enabled by default. This is especially
relevant because `font-variant: normal` turns off all the
`font-variant-ligatures` except the common ones, whereas
`font-variant: none` turns them all off *including* common ligatures.

The default value, `normal`, means don't use any alternate variants. The
`historical-forms` keyword enables historical forms, glyphs that were
common in the past but not today. All the other values are functions.

These alternate glyphs may be referenced by alternative names defined in
`@font-feature-values`. With `@font-feature-values`, you can define a
common name for the `font-variant-alternates` function values to
activate OpenType features.

numeric values of the `swash` alternate, and then use them later in

The assorted Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) variants reflect the
glyph forms defined in different Japanese national standards. Fonts
generally include glyphs defined by the most recent national standard.
JIS values allow for the inclusion of older Japanese glyph variations
when such variants are needed, such as when reproducing historical
documents.

Similarly, the `simplified` and `traditional` values allow control over
the glyph forms for characters that have been simplified over time but
for which the older, traditional form is still used in some contexts.

The `ruby` value enables display of Ruby variant glyphs. Ruby text is
generally smaller than the associated body text.

This property value allows font designers to include glyphs better
suited for smaller typography than scaled-down versions of the default
glyphs would be. Only glyph selection is affected; there is no
associated font scaling.

## Font Variant Position {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1321}

Compared to the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031486800
primary="font-variant-position property" data-type="indexterm"}previous
variants, `font-variant-position` is fairly straightforward. It's
strange, then, that it's so poorly supported.

This []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031471568 primary="subscripts"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031470832
primary="superscripts" data-type="indexterm"}property can be used to
enable specialized variant glyphs that are meant solely for
superscripted and subscripted text. As it says in the [CSS
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#font-variant-position-prop),
these glyphs are:

> ...designed within the same em-box as default glyphs and are intended
> to be laid out on the same baseline as the default glyphs, with no
> resizing or repositioning of the baseline. They are explicitly
> designed to match the surrounding text and to be more readable without
> affecting the line height.

This is in contrast to what happens with super- and subscripted text in
fonts that lack such alternates, which is usually just smaller text
that's been shifted up or down from the baseline. This sort of synthesis
of super- and subscripted text often leads to line-height increases,
which variant glyphs are generally designed to
prevent.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031468096 primary=""

primary="font-feature-settings property" data-type="indexterm"}chapter,
we've discussed font features but have yet to cover the
`font-feature-settings` property or descriptor. Similarly to
`font-variant`, `font-feature-settings` allows you to exercise low-level
control over which OpenType font features are available for use.

```
The `font-feature-settings` property[]{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_opentype
primary="fonts" secondary="OpenType font features"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_ix_opentype_feat
primary="OpenType font features" data-type="indexterm"} controls
advanced typographic features in OpenType fonts, as opposed to the
`font-variation-settings` property, which provides low-level control
over variable font characteristics.

You can list one or more comma-separated OpenType features, as defined
by the OpenType specification. For example, enabling common ligatures,
small caps, and slashed zeros would look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
font-feature-settings: "liga" on, "smcp" on, "zero" on;
```

The exact format of a \<*`feature-tag-value`*\> value is as follows:

\<*`feature-tag-value`*\>

:   \<*`string`*\> \[ \<*`integer`*\> \| `on` \| `off` \]?

For many features, the only permitted integer values are `0` and `1`,
which are equivalent to `off` and `on` (and vice versa). Some features
allow a range of numbers, however, in which case values greater than 1
both enable the feature and define the feature's selection index. If a
feature is listed but no number is provided, `1` (on) is assumed. Thus,
the following descriptors are all equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
font-feature-settings: "liga";     /* 1 is assumed */
font-feature-settings: "liga" 1;   /* 1 is declared */
font-feature-settings: "liga" on;  /* on = 1 */
```

Remember that all \<*`string`*\> values *must* be quoted. Thus, the
first of the following descriptors will be recognized, but the second
will be ignored:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
font-feature-settings: "liga", dlig;
/* common ligatures are enabled; we wanted discretionary ligatures, but forgot
   quotes, so they are not enabled */
```

A further restriction is that OpenType requires that all feature tags be
four ASCII characters long. Any feature name longer or shorter, or that
uses non-ASCII characters, is invalid and will be ignored. (This isn't
something you need to worry about unless you're using a font that has
its own made-up feature names and the font's creator didn't follow the
naming rules.)

By default, OpenType fonts *always* have the following features enabled
unless the author explicitly disables them via `font-feature-settings`
or `font-variant`:

`"calt"`

:   Contextual alternates

`"ccmp"`

:   Composed characters

`"clig"`

:   Contextual ligatures

`"liga"`

:   Standard ligatures

`"locl"`

:   Localized forms

`"mark"`

:   Mark-to-base positioning

`"mkmk"`

:   Mark-to-mark positioning

`"rlig"`

:   Required ligatures

Additionally, other features may be enabled by default in specific
situations, such as vertical alternatives (`"vert"`) for vertical runs
of text.

The OpenType `font-feature-setting` values we've discussed so far are
all listed in
[Table 14-14](#ch14.xhtml_opentype_values){data-type="xref"}, along with
a few others we didn't touch on for lack of support.

That said, `font-feature-settings` is a low-level feature designed to
handle special cases for which no other way exists to enable or access
an OpenType font feature. You also have to list all of the feature
settings you want to use in a single property value. Whenever possible,
use the `font-variant` shorthand property or one of the six associated
longhand properties: `font-variant-ligatures`, `font-variant-caps`,
`font-variant-east-asian`, `font-variant-alternates`,
`font-variant-position`, and
`font-variant-numeric`.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031195120 primary=""

secondary="font-variant descriptor" data-type="indexterm"}Now, wait a
second---isn't that almost exactly what we did with `font-variant` just
a few paragraphs ago? Yes! The `font-variant` descriptor covers nearly
everything `font-feature-settings` does, plus a little more besides. It
just does so in a more CSS-like way, with value names instead of cryptic
OpenType identifiers and Boolean toggles. Because of this, the CSS
specification explicitly encourages authors to use `font-variant`
instead of `font-feature-settings`, except when there's a font feature
that the value list of `font-variant` doesn't include.

Keep in mind that this descriptor merely makes features available for
use (or suppresses their use). It does not turn them on for the display
of text; for that, see ["Font Feature
Settings"](#ch14.xhtml_font_feature_settings){data-type="xref"}.

Just as with the `font-variant` descriptor, the `font-feature-settings`
descriptor defines which font features are enabled (or disabled) for the
font face being declared in the `@font-face` rule. For example, given
the following, Switzera will have alternative fractions and small-caps
disabled, even if such features exist in SwitzeraADF:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
  font-family: "Switzera";
  font-weight: normal;
  src: url("SwitzeraADF-Regular.otf") format("opentype");
  font-feature-settings: "afrc" off, "smcp" off;
}
```

The `font-feature-settings` descriptor can take all of the values of the
`font-feature-settings` property *except* for
`inherit`.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797031151648 primary=""

There are five registered axes, listed in
[Table 14-15](#ch14.xhtml_font_variation_axes){data-type="xref"}. We
have covered almost all of them.

  Axis       Property                Property value
  ---------- ----------------------- -----------------------------------
  `"wght"`   `font-weight`           `1` -- `1000`
  `"slnt"`   `font-style`            `oblique` / `oblique` *\<angle\>*

  `"opsz"`   `font-optical-sizing`   
  `"wdth"`   `font-stretch`          

  : [Table 14-15. ]{.label}Font variation axes {#font_variation_axes}

We use the term *registered axes* because font developers are not
limited to weight, width, optical size, slant, and italics: they can
create custom axes, and "register" them by giving them a four-letter
label. The simplest way to know if a font has such axes is to look at
the font's documentation; otherwise, you have to know how to dig into
the internals of a font's file(s) to find out. These axes can control
any aspect of the font's appearance, such as the size of the dot on
lowercase *i* and *j*. Creating custom axes is beyond the scope of this
book, but calling on them where they exist is not.

Because these axes are string values, they have to be quoted, are
case-sensitive, and are always lowercase. Imagine a font for which the
size of the dots (which are properly called *diacritic marks* or just
*diacritics*) over lowercase *i* and *j* can be changed by way of an
axis called `DCSZ` (for *diacritic size*). Furthermore, this axis has
been defined by the font's designer to allow values from 1 to 10. The
diacritic size could be maximized as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {font-family: DotFont, Helvetica, serif; font-variation-settings: "DCSZ" 10;}
```

The `font-variation-settings` descriptor is the same as the property.
Instead of declaring each registered axis separately, they are declared
on one line, comma separated:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'LeagueMono';
  src: url('LeagueMonoVariable.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 100 900;
  font-stretch: 50% 200%;
  font-variation-settings: 'wght' 100 900, 'wdth' 50 200;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1328}

Although you can set the weight, style, and so forth of a given font by
using `font-variation-settings`, it is recommended that you use the more
widely supported and human-readable properties `font-weight` and
`font-style` instead.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797030986608 primary=""

Larger text can have more features and a greater contrast between
thicker and thinner strokes. The property `font-optical-sizing` allows
authors to enable or disable this feature of variable fonts.

By default (via `auto`), browsers can modify the shape of glyphs based
on font size and pixel density. The `none` value tells the browser to
*not* do this.

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1331}

In fonts that support it, optical sizing is usually defined as a range
of numbers. If you want to explicitly change the optical sizing of a
given element's font to be a specific number, perhaps to make text
sturdier or more delicate than it would be by default, use the
`font-variation-settings` property and give it a value like `'opsz' 10`
(where `10` can be any number in the optical-sizing range).

The goal of these descriptors is to help fallback fonts better match a
primary font by overriding the metrics of the fallback font and using
those of the primary font instead.

The *ascent metric* is the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797030913376
primary="ascent metric"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797030912640

primary="line-gap metric" data-type="indexterm"}distance above the
baseline used to lay out line boxes (the distance from the baseline to
the top of the em box). The *descent metric* is the distance below the
baseline used to lay out line boxes (the distance from the baseline to
the bottom of the em box). The *line-gap metric* is the font's
recommended distance between adjacent lines of text, which is sometimes
called *external leading*.

Here's an example of a hypothetical font and its ascent, descent, and
line-gap override descriptors:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@font-face {
  font-family: "PreferredFont";
  src: url("PreferredFont.woff");
}

@font-face {
  font-family: FallbackFont;
  src: local(FallbackFont);
  ascent-override: 110%;
  descent-override: 95%;
  line-gap-override: 105%;
}
```

This will direct the browser to alter the ascent and descent heights by
110% and 95%, respectively, and increase the line gap to 105% the
distance in the fallback font.

The value `none` is pretty simple: it tells the user agent to ignore any
kerning information in the font. The `normal` value tells the user agent
to kern the text normally---that is, according to the kerning data
contained in the font. The `auto` value tells the user agent to do
whatever it thinks best, possibly depending on the type of font in use.
The OpenType specification, for example, recommends (but does not
require) that kerning be applied whenever the font supports it.
Furthermore, as per the [CSS
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-4/#font-kerning-prop):

> \[Browsers\] may synthetically support the kern feature with fonts
> that contain kerning data in the form of a `kern` table but lack kern
> feature support in the `GPOS` table.

This means, in effect, that if kerning information is built into the
font, browsers are allowed to enforce it even if the font lacks an
explicit enabling of kerning via a [feature table.]{.keep-together}

Generally speaking, a `font` declaration can have any one value from
each of the listed font properties, or else a system font value
(described in ["Using System
Fonts"](#ch14.xhtml_using_system_fonts){data-type="xref"}). Therefore,
the preceding example could be shortened as follows (and have exactly
the same effect, as illustrated by
[Figure 14-23](#ch14.xhtml_typical_font_rules){data-type="xref"}):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font: italic 900 small-caps 30px Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;}
h2 {font: bold normal italic 24px Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;}
```

<h6 id="ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1339"><span class="label">Figure 14-23.
</span>Typical font rules</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We say that the styles "could be" shortened in this way because a few
other possibilities exist, thanks to the relatively loose way in which
`font` can be written. If you look closely at the preceding example,
you'll see that the first three values don't occur in the same order. In
the `h1` rule, the first three values are for `font-style`,
`font-weight`, and `font-variant`, in that order. In the second, they're
ordered `font-weight`, `font-variant`, and `font-style`. There is
nothing wrong here because these three can be written in any order.
Furthermore, if any has a value of `normal`, that can be left out
altogether. Therefore, the following rules are equivalent to the
previous example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font: italic 900 small-caps 30px Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;}
h2 {font: bold italic 24px Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;}
```

In this example, the value of `normal` is left out of the `h2` rule, but
the effect is exactly the same as in the preceding example.

It's important to realize, however, that this free-for-all situation
applies only to the first three values of `font`. The last two are much
stricter in their behavior. Not only must `font-size` and `font-family`
appear in that order as the last two values in the declaration, but both
must always be present in a `font` declaration. Period, end of story. If
either is left out, the entire rule will be invalidated and will be
ignored completely by a user agent. Thus, the following rules will get
you the result shown in
[Figure 14-24](#ch14.xhtml_the_necessity_of_both_size_and_family){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

::: {#ch14.xhtml_font_property_limitations .sect2}
## Understanding font Property Limitations {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1341}

Because the `font` property has been part of CSS since the very
beginning, and because so many properties dealing with all the variants
came later, the `font` property has some limitations when it comes to
font variations.

First, it's important to remember that when using the `font` shorthand
property, the following properties are all set to their default values
even though they cannot be [represented]{.keep-together} in `font`:

-   `font-feature-settings`

-   `font-kerning`

-   `font-language-override`

-   `font-optical-sizing`

-   `font-palette`

-   `font-size-adjust`

-   `font-variant-alternates`

-   `font-variant-caps` (unless `small-caps` is included in the `font`
    value)

-   `font-variant-east-asian`

-   `font-variant-ligatures`

-   `font-variant-numeric`

-   `font-variation-settings`

Second, and following on the note in the previous list, only two
variation values are permitted: `small-caps` and `normal`. The numeric,
ligature, alternate, East Asian, and many of the caps variants cannot be
set via the `font` property. If you want, for example, to use small caps
and slashed zeros in your top-level headings, you would need to write
something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {font: bold small-caps 3em/1.1 Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;
```

Third, another property value that suffers from the weight of history is
font stretching. As we discussed earlier in the chapter, `font-stretch`
allows you to choose from numerous keywords or to set a percentage in
the range of 50% to 200% (inclusive). The keywords may be used in
`font`, but the percentage value may not.

:::: {#ch14.xhtml_adding_the_line_height .sect2}
## Adding the Line Height {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1342}

We also can set the []{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797030430416
primary="line-height property" data-type="indexterm"}value of the
`line-height` property by using `font`, even though `line-height` is a
text property (not covered in this chapter), not a font property. It's
done as a sort of addition to the `font-size` value, separated from it
by a forward slash (`/`):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-size: 12px;}
h2 {font: bold italic 200%/1.2 Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;}
```

These rules, demonstrated in
[Figure 14-25](#ch14.xhtml_adding_line_height_to_the_mix){data-type="xref"},
set all `<h2>` elements to be bold and italic (using face for one of the
sans-serif font families), set the `font-size` to `24px` (twice the
`body`'s size), and set the `line-height` to `28.8px`.

<h6 id="ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1343"><span class="label">Figure 14-25.
</span>Adding line height to the mix</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This addition of a value for `line-height` is entirely optional, just as
the first three `font` values are. If you do include a `line-height`
value, remember that `font-size` always comes before `line-height`,
never after, and the two are always separated by a slash.

###### Warning {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1344}

This may seem repetitive, but it's one of the most common errors made by
CSS authors, so we can't say it enough: the required values for `font`
are `font-size` and `font-family`, in that order. Everything else is
strictly optional.

## Using the Shorthand Properly {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1345}

It is important to remember that `font`, being a shorthand property, can
act in unexpected ways if you are careless with its use. Consider the
following rules, which are illustrated in
[Figure 14-26](#ch14.xhtml_shorthand_changes){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, h2, h3 {font: italic small-caps 250% sans-serif;}
h2 {font: 200% sans-serif;}
h3 {font-size: 150%;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>A level 1 heading element</h1>
<h2>A level 2 heading element</h2>
<h3>A level 3 heading element</h3>
```

<figure>
<div id="ch14.xhtml_shorthand_changes" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1426.png" width="510" height="145"

<h6 id="ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1346"><span class="label">Figure 14-26.
</span>Shorthand changes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Did you notice that the `<h2>` element is neither italicized nor
small-capped, and that none of the elements are bold? This is the
correct behavior. When the shorthand property `font` is used, any
omitted values are reset to their defaults. Thus, the previous example
could be written as follows and still be exactly equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, h2, h3 {font: italic normal small-caps 250% sans-serif;}
h2 {font: normal normal normal 200% sans-serif;}
h3 {font-size: 150%;}
```

This sets the `<h2>` element's font style and variant to `normal`, and
the `font-weight` of all three elements to `normal`. This is the
expected behavior of shorthand properties. The `<h3>` does not suffer
the same fate as the `<h2>` because you use the property `font-size`,
which is not a shorthand property and therefore affects only its own
value.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797030203536 primary=""

primary="system fonts" data-type="indexterm"}want to make a web page
blend in with the user's operating system, the system font values of
`font` come in handy. These are used to take the font size, family,
weight, style, and variant of elements of the operating system, and
apply them to an element. The values are as follows:

`caption`

:   Used for captioned controls, such as buttons

`icon`

:   Used to label icons

`menu`

:   Used in menus---that is, drop-down menus and menu lists

`message-box`

:   Used in dialog boxes

`small-caption`

:   Used for labeling small controls

`status-bar`

:   Used in window status bars

For example, you might want to set the font of a button to be the same
as that of the buttons found in the operating system. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
button {font: caption;}
```

With these values, you can create web-based applications that look very
much like applications native to the user's operating system.

Note that system fonts may be set only as a whole; that is, the font
family, size, weight, style, etc., are all set together. Therefore, the
button text from our previous example will look exactly the same as
button text in the operating system, whether or not the size matches any
of the content around the button. You can, however, alter the individual
values after the system font has been set. Thus, the following rule will
make sure the button's font is the same size as its parent element's
font:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
button {font: caption; font-size: 1em;}
```

If you call for a system font and no such font exists on the user's
machine, the user agent may try to find an approximation, such as
reducing the size of the `caption` font to arrive at the `small-caption`
font. If no such approximation is possible, the user agent should use a
default font of its own. If it can find a system font but can't read all
of its values, it should use the default value. For example, a user
agent may be able to find a `status-bar` font but not get any
information about whether the font is small caps. In that case, the user
agent will use the value `normal` for the `small-caps` property.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Font Matching" data-type="sect1"}
::: {#ch14.xhtml_font_matching .sect1}
# Font Matching {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1348}

As you've seen, CSS allows for the []{#ch14.xhtml_ix_font_match
primary="fonts" secondary="matching" data-type="indexterm"}matching of
font families, weights, and variants. This is all accomplished through
font matching, which is a vaguely complicated procedure. Understanding
it is important for authors who want to help user agents make good font
selections when displaying their documents. We left it for the end of
the chapter because it's not really necessary to understand how the font
properties work, and some readers will probably want to skip this part.
If you're still interested, here's how font matching works:

1.  The user agent creates, or otherwise accesses, a database of font
    properties. This database lists the various CSS properties of all
    the fonts to which the user agent has access. Typically, this will
    be all fonts installed on the machine, although there could be
    others (for example, the user agent could have its own built-in
    fonts). If the user agent encounters two identical fonts, it will
    ignore one of them.

2.  The user agent takes apart an element to which font properties have
    been applied and constructs a list of font properties necessary for
    the display of that element. Based on that list, the user agent
    makes an initial choice of a font family to use in displaying the
    element. If there is a complete match, the user agent can use that
    font. Otherwise, the user agent needs to do a little more work.

3.  A font is first matched against the `font-stretch` property.

4.  A font is next matched against the `font-style` property. The
    keyword `italic` is matched by any font that is labeled as either
    `italic` or `oblique`. If neither is available, the match fails.

5.  The next match is to `font-weight`, which can never fail thanks to
    the way `font-weight` is handled in CSS (explained in ["How Weights
    Work"](#ch14.xhtml_how_weights_work){data-type="xref"}).

6.  Then, `font-size` is tackled. This must be matched within a certain
    tolerance, but that tolerance is defined by the user agent. Thus,
    one user agent might allow matching within a 20% margin of error,
    whereas another might allow only 10% differences between the size
    specified and the size that is actually used.

7.  If no font matched in step 2, the user agent looks for alternate
    fonts within the same font family. If it finds any, it repeats step
    2 for that font.

8.  Assuming a generic match has been found but doesn't contain
    everything needed to display a given element---the font is missing
    the copyright symbol, for instance---the user agent goes back to
    step 3, which entails a search for another alternate font and
    another trip through step 2.

9.  Finally, if no match has been made and all alternate fonts have been
    tried, the user agent selects the default font for the given generic
    font family and does the best it can to display the element
    correctly.

Furthermore, the user agent does the following to resolve the handling
of font variants and features:

1.  Check for font features enabled by default, including features
    required for a given script. The core set of default-enabled
    features is `"calt"`, `"ccmp"`, `"clig"`, `"liga"`, `"locl"`,
    `"mark"`, `"mkmk"`, and `"rlig"`.

2.  If the font is defined via an `@font-face` rule, check for the
    features implied by the `font-variant` descriptor in the
    `@font-face` rule. Then check for the font features implied by the
    `font-feature-settings` descriptor in the `@font-face` rule.

3.  Check feature settings determined by properties other than
    `font-variant` or `font-feature-settings`. (For example, setting a
    nondefault value for the `letter-spacing` property will disable
    ligatures.)

4.  Check for features implied by the value of the `font-variant`
    property, the related `font-variant` subproperties (e.g.,
    `font-variant-ligatures`), and any other property that may call for
    the use of OpenType features (e.g., `font-kerning`).

5.  Check for the features implied by the value of the
    `font-feature-settings` property.

The whole process is long and tedious, but it helps to understand how
user agents pick the fonts they do. For example, you might specify the
use of Times or any other serif font in a document:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-family: Times, serif;}
```

For each element, the user agent should examine the characters in that
element and determine whether Times can provide characters to match. In
most cases, it can do so with no problem.

Assume, however, that a Chinese character has been placed in the middle
of a paragraph. Times has nothing that can match this character, so the
user agent has to work around the character or look for another font
that can fulfill the needs of displaying that element. Any Western font
is highly unlikely to contain Chinese characters, but should one exist
(let's call it AsiaTimes), the user agent could use it in the display of
that one element---or simply for the single character. Thus, the whole
paragraph might be displayed using [AsiaTimes,]{.keep-together} or
everything in the paragraph might be in Times except for the single
Chinese character, which is displayed in
AsiaTimes.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797030060864 primary=""

# Summary {#ch14.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1349}

From what was initially a very simple set of font properties, CSS has
grown to allow fine-grained and wide-ranging influence over the way
fonts are displayed on the web. From custom fonts downloaded over the
web to custom-built families assembled out of a variety of individual
faces, authors may be fairly said to overflow with font
power.[]{#ch14.xhtml_idm45797030058384 primary=""
startref="ix_fonts_ch14" data-type="indexterm"}

The typographic options available to authors today are far stronger than
ever, but always remember: you must use this power wisely. While you can
have 17 fonts in use on your site, that definitely doesn't mean that you
should. Quite aside from the aesthetic difficulties this could present
for your users, it would also make the total page weight much, much
higher than it needs to be. As with any other aspect of web design, you
are advised to use your power wisely, not wildly.

Because []{#ch15.xhtml_ix_text_properties_ch15 primary="text properties"
data-type="indexterm"}text is so important, many CSS properties affect
it in one way or another. But didn't we just cover that in
[Chapter 14](../Text/ch14.xhtml#fonts){data-type="xref"}? Not exactly:
we covered only fonts---the importing and usage of typefaces. Text
styles are different.

OK, so what is the difference between text and fonts? At the simplest
level, *text* is the content, and *fonts* are used to display that
content. Fonts provide the shape for the letters. Text is the styling
around those shapes. Using text properties, you can affect the position
of text in relation to the rest of the line, superscript it, underline
it, and change the capitalization. You can affect the size, color, and
placement of text decorations.

# Indentation and Inline Alignment {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1350}

Let's start with a discussion of how you can affect the inline
positioning of text within a line. Think of these basic actions as the
same types of steps you might take to create a newsletter or write a
report.

Originally, []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797030032320
primary="vertical writing direction" data-type="indexterm"}CSS was based
on concepts of *horizontal* and *vertical*. To better support all
languages and writing directions, CSS now uses the terms *block
direction* and *inline direction*. If your primary language is
Western-derived, you're accustomed to a block direction of top to
bottom, and an inline direction of left to right.

The *block direction* is the []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797030028896
primary="text properties" secondary="block direction"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797030027888
primary="block direction (axis)" data-type="indexterm"}direction in
which block elements are placed by default in the current writing mode.
In English, for example, the block direction is top to bottom, or
vertical, as one paragraph (or other text element) is placed beneath the
one before. Some languages have vertical text, like Mongolian. When text
is vertical, the block direction is horizontal.

The *inline direction* is the []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797030026256
primary="text properties" secondary="inline direction"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797030025248
primary="inline direction" data-type="indexterm"}direction in which
inline elements are written within a block. To again take English as an
example, the inline direction is left to right, or horizontal. In
languages like Arabic and Hebrew, the inline direction is right to left
instead. To reuse the example from the preceding paragraph, Mongolian's
inline direction is top to bottom.

Let's reconsider English for a moment. A plain page of English text,
displayed on a screen, has a vertical block direction (from top to
bottom) and a horizontal inline direction (from left to right). But if
the page is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise by using CSS Transforms,
suddenly the block direction is horizontal and the inline direction is
vertical. (And bottom to top, at that.)

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1351}

You can still find a lot of English-centric blog posts and other
CSS-related documentation on the web using the terms *vertical* and
*horizontal* when talking about writing directions. When you do,
mentally translate them to *block* and *inline* as needed.

Using `text-indent`, the first line of any element can be indented by a
given length, even if that length is negative. A common use for this
property is to indent the first line of a [paragraph:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-indent: 3em;}
```

This rule will cause the first line of any paragraph to be indented 3
ems, as shown in
[Figure 15-1](#ch15.xhtml_text_indenting){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">

</span>Text indenting</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In general, you can apply `text-indent` to any element that generates a
block box, and the indentation will occur along the inline direction.
You can't apply it to inline elements or replaced elements such as
images. However, if you have an image within the first line of a
block-level element, it will be shifted over with the rest of the text
in the line.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1355}

If you want to "indent" the first line of an inline element, you can
create the effect with left padding or a margin.
:::

You can also set negative values for `text-indent` to create a *hanging
indent*, where the first line hangs out to one side of the rest of the
element:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-indent: −4em;}
```

Be careful when setting a negative value for `text-indent`; the first
few words may be chopped off by the edge of the browser window if you
aren't careful. To avoid display problems, we recommend you use a margin
or padding to accommodate the negative indentation:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-indent: −4em; padding-left: 4em;}
```

Any unit of length, including percentage values, may be used with
`text-indent`. In the following case, the percentage refers to the width
of the parent element of the element being indented. In other words, if
you set the indent value to `10%`, the first line of an affected element
will be indented by 10% of its parent element's width, as shown in
[Figure 15-2](#ch15.xhtml_text_indenting_with_percentages){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {width: 400px;}
p {text-indent: 10%;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>
<p>This paragraph is contained inside a DIV, which is 400px wide, so the
first line of the paragraph is indented 40px (400 * 10% = 40).  This is
because percentages are computed with respect to the width of the element.</p>
</div>
```

<figure class="coderesult">

</div>
</figure>

Note that because `text-indent` is inherited, some browsers, like the
Yandex browser, inherit the computed values, while Safari, Firefox,
Edge, and Chrome inherit the declared value. In the following, both bits
of text will be indented 5 ems in Yandex and 10% of the current
element's width in other browsers, because the value of `5em` is
inherited by the paragraph from its parent `<div>` in Yandex and older
versions of WebKit, whereas most evergreen browsers inherit the declared
value of 10%:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#outer {width: 50em;}
div#inner {text-indent: 10%;}
p {width: 20em;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<div id="outer">
<div id="inner">
This first line of the DIV is indented by 5em.
<p>
This paragraph is 20em wide, and the first line of the paragraph
is indented 5em in WebKit and 2em elsewhere.  This is because
computed values for 'text-indent' are inherited in WebKit,
while the declared values are inherited elsewhere.
</p>
</div>
</div>
```

As of late 2022, two keywords are being considered for addition to
`text-indent`:

`hanging`

:   Inverts[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029739408 primary="hanging indent"
    data-type="indexterm"} the indentation effect; that is,
    `text-indent: 3em hanging` would indent all the lines of text
    *except* the first line. This is similar to the negative-value
    indentation discussed previously, but without risking cutting off
    text, because instead of pulling the first line out of the content
    box, all the lines but the first are indented away from the edge of
    the content box.

`each-line`

:   Indents[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029736336 primary="each-line indent"
    data-type="indexterm"} the first line of the element plus any line
    that starts after a forced line break, such as that caused by a
    `<br>`, but not lines that follow a soft line
    break.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029734960 primary=""
    startref="ix_indent_text"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029733984 primary=""

    startref="ix_text_indents" data-type="indexterm"}

When supported, either keyword can be used in conjunction with a length
or percentage, such as the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-indent: 10% hanging;}
pre {text-indent: 5ch each-line;}

The []{#ch15.xhtml_ix_write_mode_text_align
primary="writing modes (flow direction)" secondary="text alignment"
data-type="indexterm"}quickest way to understand how these values work
is to examine
[Figure 15-3](#ch15.xhtml_selected_behaviors_of_the_text-align_pro){data-type="xref"},
which demonstrates the most widely used values. The values `left`,
`right`, and `center` cause the text within elements to be aligned
exactly as described by these words in horizontal languages like English
or Arabic, regardless of the language's inline direction.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch15.xhtml_selected_behaviors_of_the_text-align_pro"
class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1503.png" width="600" height="254"

<h6 id="ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1359"><span class="label">Figure 15-3.
</span>Selected behaviors of the <code>text-align</code> property</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The default value of `text-align` is `start`, which is the equivalent of
`left` in LTR languages, and `right` in RTL languages. In vertical
languages. `left` and `right` are mapped to the start or end edge,
respectively. This is illustrated in
[Figure 15-4](#ch15.xhtml_left_comma_right_comma_and_center_in_ver){data-type="xref"}.

Because `text-align` applies only to block-level elements such as
paragraphs, there's no way to center an anchor within its line without
aligning the rest of the line (nor would you want to, since that would
likely cause text overlap).

As you may expect, `center` causes each line of text to be centered
within the element. If you've ever come across the long-ago deprecated
`<CENTER>` element, you may be tempted to believe that
`text-align: center` is the same. It is actually quite different. The
[`<CENTER>`]{.keep-together} element affected not only text, but also
centered whole elements, such as tables. The `text-align` property does
not control the alignment of elements, only their [inline
content.]{.keep-together}

### Start and end alignment {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1361}

Remembering that []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029626176
primary="end and start alignment"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029625056
primary="start and end alignment" data-type="indexterm"}CSS was based on
concepts of *horizontal* and *vertical*, the initial default value was
originally "a nameless value that acts as *left* if *direction* is
*ltr*, *right* if *direction* is *rtl*." The default value now has a
name: `start`, which is the equivalent of `left` in LTR languages, and
`right` in RTL languages.

The default value of `start` means that text is aligned to the start
edge of its line box. In LTR languages like English, that's the left
edge; in RTL languages such as Arabic, it's the right edge. In vertical
languages, it will be the top or bottom, depending on the writing
direction. The upshot is that the default value is much more aware of
the document's language direction while leaving the default behavior the
same in the vast majority of existing
cases.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029618880 primary=""
startref="ix_write_mode_text_align" data-type="indexterm"}

In a like manner, `end` aligns text with the end edge of each line
box---the right edge in LTR languages, the left edge in RTL languages,
and so forth.
[Figure 15-5](#ch15.xhtml_start_and_end_alignment-id1){data-type="xref"}

:::: {#ch15.xhtml_justified_text .sect3}
### Justified text {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1363}

An often-overlooked alignment value is `justify`, which raises some
issues of its own. In justified text, both ends of a line of text
(except the last line, which can be set with `text-align-last`) are
placed at the inner edges of the parent element, as shown in
[Figure 15-6](#ch15.xhtml_justified_text-id1){data-type="xref"}. Then,
the spacing between words and letters is adjusted so that the words are
distributed evenly throughout the line. Justified text is common in the
print world (for example, in this book), but under CSS, a few extra
considerations come into play.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch15.xhtml_justified_text-id1" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1506.png" width="600" height="214"

<h6 id="ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1364"><span class="label">Figure 15-6.
</span>Justified text</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The user agent determines how justified text should be stretched or
distributed to fill the space between the left and right edges of the
parent. Some browsers, for example, might add extra space only between
words, while others might distribute the extra space between letters
(although the CSS specification states that "user agents may not further
increase or decrease the inter-character space" if the property
`letter-spacing` has been assigned a length value). Other user agents
may reduce space on some lines, thus mashing the text together a bit
more than usual.

The value `justify-all` sets full justification for both `text-align`
and `text-align-last` (covered in an upcoming section).

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1365}

As of mid-2022, the `justify-all` value is not supported by any browser,
even though nearly all of them support `text-align: justify` and
`text-align-last: justify`. This gap in support remains a mystery as of
press time, but is solved in most browsers with the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

We have one more []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029578608
primary="match-parent keyword, text-align" data-type="indexterm"}value
to cover: `match-parent`. If you declare `text-align: match-parent`, and
the inherited value of `text-align` is `start` or `end`, the alignment
of the `match-parent` element will be calculated with respect to the
parent element's horizontal or vertical, rather than inline, direction.

For example, you could force any English element's text alignment to
match the alignment of a parent element, regardless of its writing
direction, as in the following example.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029574896

block-level elements. In fact, `text-align-last` applies to any line of
text that immediately precedes a forced line break, whether or not that
line break is triggered by the end of an element. Thus, a line break
created by a `<br>` tag will make the line of text immediately before
that break use the value of `text-align-last`.

An interesting wrinkle arises with `text-align-last`: if the first line
of text in an element is also the last line of text in the element, the
value of `text-align-last` takes precedence over the value of
`text-align`. Thus, the following styles will result in a centered
paragraph, not a start-aligned

## Word Spacing {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1370}

The `word-spacing` property[]{#ch15.xhtml_ix_space_word
primary="spacing" secondary="word"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_ix_word_space_prop
primary="word-spacing property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_ix_text_word_space
primary="text properties" secondary="word spacing"
data-type="indexterm"} is used to modify interword spacing, accepting a
positive or negative length. This length is *added* to the standard
space between words. Therefore, the default value of `normal` is the
same as setting a value of `0`.

```{=html}

  **Animatable**       Yes
  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

```{=html}

If you supply a positive length value, the space between words will
increase. Setting a negative value for `word-spacing` brings words
closer together:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.spread {word-spacing: 0.5em;}
p.tight {word-spacing: -0.5em;}
p.default {word-spacing: normal;}
p.zero {word-spacing: 0;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p class="spread">The spaces—as in those between the “words”—in this paragraph
   will be increased by 0.5em.</p>
<p class="tight">The spaces—as in those between the “words”—in this paragraph
   will be increased by 0.5em.</p>
<p class="default">The spaces—as in those between the “words”—in this paragraph
   will be neither increased nor decreased.</p>
<p class="zero">The spaces—as in those between the “words”—in this paragraph
   will be neither increased nor decreased.</p>
```

Manipulating these settings has the effect shown in

In CSS terms, a *word* is any string of nonwhitespace characters that is
surrounded by whitespace of some kind. This means `word-spacing` is
unlikely to work in any languages that employ pictographs, or non-Roman
writing styles. This is also why the em dashes in the previous example's
text don't get space around them. From the CSS point of view,
"spaces---as" is a single word.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029245152
primary="" startref="ix_text_word_space"

Use caution. The `word-spacing` property allows you to create very
unreadable documents, as

As with the `word-spacing` property, the permitted values of
`letter-spacing` include any length, though character-relative lengths
like `em` (rather than root-relative lengths like `rem`) are recommended
to ensure that the spacing is proportional to the font size.

The default keyword is `normal`, which has the same effect as
`letter-spacing: 0`. Any length value you enter will increase or
decrease the space between letters by that amount.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029051008
primary="text properties" secondary="alignment within a line"
data-type="indexterm"}important to remember that space between words may
be altered by the value of the property `text-align`. If an element is
justified, the spaces between letters and words may be altered to fit
the text along the full width of the line. This may in turn alter the
spacing declared using `word-spacing`.

If a length value is assigned to `letter-spacing`, that value cannot be
changed by `text-align`; but if the value of `letter-spacing` is
`normal`, inter-character spacing may be changed to justify the text.
CSS does not specify how the spacing should be calculated, so user
agents use their own algorithms. To prevent `text-align` from altering
letter spacing while keeping the default letter spacing, declare
`letter-spacing: 0`.

Note that []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797029045056
primary="letter-spacing property" data-type="indexterm"}computed values
are inherited, so child elements with larger or smaller text will have
the same word or letter spacing as their parent element. You cannot
define a scaling factor for `word-spacing` or `letter-spacing` to be
inherited in place of the computed value (in contrast with
`line-height`). As a result, you may run into problems such as those
shown in
[Figure 15-11](#ch15.xhtml_inherited_letter_spacing){data-type="xref"}:

As `inherit` inherits the ancestor's letter-spacing computed length, the
only way to achieve letter spacing that's in proportion to the size of
the text is to set it explicitly on each element, as
follows:[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028984224 primary=""

The []{#ch15.xhtml_ix_text_line_height primary="text properties"
secondary="line height" data-type="indexterm"}distance between lines can
be affected by changing the height of a line. Note that *height* here is
with respect to the line of text itself, assuming that the longer axis
of a line is *width*, even if it's written vertically. The property
names we cover from here will reveal a strong bias toward Western
languages and their writing directions; this is an artifact of the early
days of CSS, when Western languages were the only ones that could be
easily [represented.]{.keep-together}

The `line-height` property refers to the distance between the baselines
of lines of text rather than the size of the font, and it determines the
amount by which the height of each element's box is increased or
decreased. In the most basic cases, specifying `line-height` is a way to
increase (or decrease) the vertical space between lines of text, but
this is a misleadingly simple way of looking at how `line-height` works.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028902064 primary="leading"

extra space between lines of text above and beyond the font's size. In
other words, the difference between the value of `line-height` and the
size of the font is the leading.

When applied to a block-level element, `line-height` defines the
*minimum* distance between text baselines within that element. Note that
it defines a minimum, not an absolute value. Baselines of text can wind
up being pushed farther apart than the value of `line-height`, for
example, if a line contains an inline image or form control that is
taller than the declared line height. The `line-height` property does
not affect layout for replaced elements like images, but it still
applies to them.

secondary="inline-level elements" data-type="indexterm"}learned in
[Chapter 6](../Text/ch06.xhtml#basic-visual-formatting){data-type="xref"},
every element in a line of text generates a *content area*, which is
determined by the size of the font. This

primary="inline-level elements"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028853328
primary="line boxes" data-type="indexterm"}content area, in turn,
generates an *inline box* that is, in the absence of any other factors,
exactly equal to the content area. The leading generated by
`line-height` is one of the factors that increase or decrease the height
of each inline box.

To determine the []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028851312
primary="font-size property" secondary="leading determined by"
data-type="indexterm"}leading for a given element, subtract the computed
value of `font-size` from the computed value of `line-height`. That
value is the total amount of leading. And remember, it can be a negative
number. The leading is then divided in half, and each half-leading is
applied to the top and bottom of the content area. The result is the
inline box for that element. In this way, each line of text is centered
within the line height as long as the height of the line isn't forced
beyond its minimum height by a replaced element or other factor.

As an example, let's say `font-size` (and therefore the content area) is
14 pixels tall, and `line-height` is computed to 18 pixels. The
difference (4 pixels) is divided in half, and each half is applied to
the top and bottom of the content area. This effectively centers the
content by creating an inline box that is 18 pixels tall, with 2 extra
pixels above and below the content area. This sounds like a roundabout
way to describe how `line-height` works, but there are excellent reasons
for the description.

Once all of the inline boxes have been generated for a given line of
content, they are then considered in the construction of the line box. A
line box is exactly as tall as needed to enclose the top of the tallest
inline box and the bottom of the lowest inline box.
[Figure 15-12](#ch15.xhtml_line_box_diagram){data-type="xref"} shows a
diagram of this process.

### Assigning values to line-height {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1385}

Let's now consider the possible values of `line-height`. If you use the
default value of [`normal`]{.keep-together}, the user agent must
calculate the space between lines. Values can vary by user agent, but
the `normal` default is generally around 1.2 times the size of the font,
which makes line boxes taller than the value of `font-size` for a given
element.

Many values are simple length measures (e.g., `18px` or `2em` ), but
\<*`number`*\> values with no length unit are preferable in many
situations.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1386}

Be aware that even if you use a valid length measurement, such as `4cm`,
the browser (or the operating system) may be using an incorrect metric
for real-world measurements, so the line height may not show up as
exactly 4 centimeters on your monitor.
:::

The `em`, `ex`, and percentage values are calculated with respect to the
`font-size` of the element. The results of the following CSS and HTML

### Understanding line-height and inheritance {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1388}

When the `line-height` is []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028736944
primary="inheritance" secondary="line-height"
data-type="indexterm"}inherited by one block-level element from another,
things get a bit trickier. The `line-height` values inherit from the
parent element as computed from the parent, not the child. The results
of the following markup are shown in
[Figure 15-14](#ch15.xhtml_small_line-height_comma_large_font-size){data-type="xref"}.
It probably wasn't what the author had in mind:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-size: 10px;}
div {line-height: 1em;}  /* computes to '10px' */
p {font-size: 18px;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<div>
<p>This paragraph's 'font-size' is 18px, but the inherited 'line-height'
value is only 10px.  This may cause the lines of text to overlap each
other by a small amount.</p>
</div>
```

</span>Small line-height, large font-size, slight problem</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Why are the lines so close together? Because the computed `line-height`
value of `10px` was inherited by the paragraph from its parent `<div>`.
One solution to the small `line-height` problem depicted in
[Figure 15-14](#ch15.xhtml_small_line-height_comma_large_font-size){data-type="xref"}
is to set an explicit `line-height` for every element, but that's not
very practical. A better alternative is to specify a number, which
actually sets a scaling factor:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font-size: 10px;}
div {line-height: 1;}
p {font-size: 18px;}
```

When you specify a number with no length unit, you cause the scaling
factor to be an inherited value instead of a computed value. The number
will be applied to the element and all of its child elements so that

The `vertical-align` property accepts any one of eight keywords, a
percentage value, or a length value. The keywords are a mix of the
familiar and unfamiliar: `baseline` (the default value), `sub`, `super`,
`bottom`, `text-bottom`, `middle`, `top`, and `text-top`. We'll examine
how each keyword works in relation to inline elements.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1394}

Remember: `vertical-align` does *not* affect the alignment of content
within a block-level element, just the alignment of inline content
within a line of text or a table cell. This may change in the future,
but as of mid-2022, proposals to widen its scope have yet to move
forward.

### Baseline alignment {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1395}

Using `vertical-align: baseline` forces[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028452176
primary="baselines" secondary="vertical alignment of text"
data-type="indexterm"} the baseline of an element to align with the
baseline of its parent. Browsers, for the most part, do this anyway,
since you'd probably expect the bottoms of all text elements in a line
to be aligned.

If a vertically aligned element doesn't have a baseline---that is, if
it's an image, a form input, or another replaced element---then the
bottom of the element is aligned with the baseline of its parent, as
[Figure 15-16](#ch15.xhtml_baseline_alignment_of_an_image){data-type="xref"}
shows:

``` {.less_space .pagebreak-before code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {vertical-align: baseline;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>The image found in this paragraph <img src="dot.gif" alt="A dot" /> has its
bottom edge aligned with the baseline of the text in the paragraph.</p>
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch15.xhtml_baseline_alignment_of_an_image" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1516.png" width="600" height="43"

<h6 id="ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1396"><span class="label">Figure 15-16.
</span>Baseline alignment of an image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This alignment rule is important because it causes some web browsers to
always put a replaced element's bottom edge on the baseline, even if the
line includes no other text. For example, let's say you have an image in
a table cell all by itself. The image may actually be on a baseline, but
in some browsers, the space below the baseline causes a gap to appear
beneath the image. []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028399312
primary="text properties" secondary="gap behavior in"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028398336 primary="gaps"
secondary="text-alignment behavior" data-type="indexterm"}Other browsers
will "shrink-wrap" the image with the table cell, and no gap will
appear. The gap behavior is correct, despite its lack of appeal to most
authors.

### Superscripting and subscripting {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1398}

The []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028390960 primary="subscripts"
data-type="indexterm"}declaration `vertical-align: sub` causes an
element to be subscripted, meaning that its baseline (or bottom, if it's
a replaced element) is lowered with respect to its parent's baseline.
The specification doesn't define the distance the element is lowered, so
it may vary depending on the user agent.

The `super` value[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028388816 primary="superscripts"
data-type="indexterm"} is the opposite of `sub`; it raises the element's
baseline (or bottom of a replaced element) with respect to the parent's
baseline. Again, the distance the text is raised depends on the user
agent.

Note that the values `sub` and `super` do *not* change the element's
font size, so subscripted or superscripted text will not become smaller
(or larger). Instead, any text in the sub- or superscripted element
will, by default, be the same size as text in the parent element, as
illustrated by
[Figure 15-17](#ch15.xhtml_superscript_and_subscript_alignment){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
span.raise {vertical-align: super;}

### Top and bottom alignment {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1401}

The `vertical-align: top` option []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028302544
primary="bottom keyword, vertical-align"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028301840
primary="top keyword, vertical-align" data-type="indexterm"}aligns the
top of the element's inline box with the top of the line box. Similarly,
`vertical-align: bottom` aligns the bottom of the element's inline box
with the bottom of the line box. Thus, the following markup results in
[Figure 15-18](#ch15.xhtml_top_and_bottom_alignment){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.soarer {vertical-align: top;}

```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>And in this paragraph, as before, we have
first a <img src="tall.gif" alt="tall" class="soarer" /> image and
then a <img src="short.gif" alt="short" class="soarer" /> image,
and then some text which is not tall.</p>

<p>This paragraph, as you can see, contains
first a <img src="tall.gif" alt="tall" class="feeder" /> image and
then a <img src="short.gif" alt="short" class="feeder" /> image,
and then some text that is not tall.</p>
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch15.xhtml_top_and_bottom_alignment" class="figure">

</span>Top and bottom alignment</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The second line of the first paragraph contains two inline elements
whose top edges are aligned with each other. They're also well above the
baseline of the text. The second paragraph shows the inverted case: two
images whose bottoms are aligned and are well below the baseline of
their line. This is because in both cases, the sizes of the elements in
the line have increased the line's height beyond what the font's size
would normally create.

If you want instead to align elements with the top or bottom edge of
just the text in the line, `text-top` and `text-bottom` are the values
you seek. For the purposes of these values, replaced elements, or any
other kinds of nontext elements, are ignored. Instead, a *default* text
box is considered. This default box is derived from the `font-size` of
the parent element. The bottom of the aligned element's inline box is
then aligned with the bottom of the default text box. Thus, given the
following markup, you get a result like the one shown in
[Figure 15-19](#ch15.xhtml_text-top_and_bottom_alignment){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.ttop {vertical-align: text-top;}

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}

The []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797028052640
primary="middle keyword, vertical-align" data-type="indexterm"}value
`middle` is usually (but not always) applied to images. It does not have
the exact effect you might assume, given its name. The `middle` value
aligns the middle of an inline element's box with a point that is
`0.5ex` above the baseline of the parent element, where `1ex` is defined
relative to the `font-size` for the parent element.
[Figure 15-20](#ch15.xhtml_precise_detail_of_middle_alignment){data-type="xref"}
shows this in more detail.

<figure>
<div id="ch15.xhtml_precise_detail_of_middle_alignment" class="figure">

</span>Precise detail of middle alignment</h6>

</figure>

Since most user agents treat `1ex` as one-half em, `middle` usually
aligns the vertical midpoint of an element with a point one-quarter em
above the parent's baseline, though this is not a defined distance and
so can vary from one user agent to another.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Percentages" data-type="sect3"}
::: {#ch15.xhtml_text_percentages .sect3}
### Percentages {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1406}

Percentages don't let you simulate `align="middle"` for images. Instead,
setting a percentage value for `vertical-align` raises or lowers the
baseline of the element (or the bottom edge of a replaced element) by
the amount declared, with respect to the parent's baseline. (The
percentage you specify is calculated as a percentage of `line-height`
for the element, *not* its parent.) Positive percentage values raise the
element, and negative values lower it.

Depending on how the text is raised or lowered, it can appear to be
placed in adjacent lines, as shown in
[Figure 15-21](#ch15.xhtml_percentages_and_fun_effects){data-type="xref"},
so take care when using percentage values:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
sub {vertical-align: −100%;}
sup {vertical-align: 100%;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}

<sub>sink into despair...</sub></p>

::: {#ch15.xhtml_length_alignment .sect3}
### Length alignment {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1408}

Finally, let's consider vertical alignment with a specific length. The
`vertical-align` option is very basic: it shifts an element up or down
by the declared distance. Thus, `vertical-align: 5px;` will shift an
element upward 5 pixels from its unaligned placement. Negative length
values shift the element downward.

It's important to realize that vertically aligned text does not become
part of another line, nor does it overlap text in other lines. Consider
[Figure 15-22](#ch15.xhtml_inline_alignments_can_cause_lines_to){data-type="xref"},
in which some vertically aligned text appears in the middle of a
paragraph.

<figure class="coderesult">

</span>Vertical alignments can cause lines to get taller</h6>
</div>

As you can see, any vertically aligned element can affect the height of
the line. Recall the description of a line box, which is exactly as tall
as necessary to enclose the top of the tallest inline box and the bottom
of the lowest inline box. This includes inline boxes that have been
shifted up or down by vertical
alignment.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797027922592 primary=""

The default value `none` leaves the text alone and uses whatever
capitalization exists in the source document. As their names imply,
`uppercase` and `lowercase` convert text into all upper- or lowercase
characters. The `full-width` value forces the writing of a character
inside a square, as if on a typographical grid.

*CJK* stands for *Chinese/Japanese/Korean*. CJK characters take up the

Different user agents may have different ways of deciding where words
begin and, as a result, which letters are capitalized. For example, the
text "heading-one" in the `<h1>` element, shown in
[Figure 15-23](#ch15.xhtml_various_kinds_of_text_transformation){data-type="xref"},
could be rendered in one of two ways: "Heading-one" or "Heading-One."
CSS does not say which is correct, so either is possible.

You may have also noticed that the last letter in the `<h1>` element in
[Figure 15-23](#ch15.xhtml_various_kinds_of_text_transformation){data-type="xref"}
is still uppercase. This is correct: when applying a `text-transform` of
`capitalize`, CSS requires user agents to make sure only the first
letter of each word is capitalized. They can ignore the rest of the
word.

As a property, `text-transform` may seem minor, but it's very useful if
you suddenly decide to capitalize all your `<h1>` elements. Instead of
individually changing the content of all your `<h1>` elements, you can
just use `text-transform` to make the change for you:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {text-transform: uppercase;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<h1>This is an H1 element</h1>
```

The advantages of using `text-transform` are twofold. First, you need to
write only a single rule to make this change, rather than changing the
`<h1>` itself. Second, if you decide later to switch from all capitals
back to initial capitals, the change is even easier:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {text-transform: capitalize;}
```

Remember that `capitalize` is a simple letter substitution at the
beginning of each "word." CSS doesn't check for grammar, so common
headline-capitalization conventions, such as leaving articles (*a*,
*an*, *the*) all lowercase, won't be enforced.

Different languages have different rules for which letters should be
capitalized. The `text-transform` property takes into account
language-specific case mappings.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797027618448
primary="" startref="ix_capital_text"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797027670816 primary=""
startref="ix_text_capital" data-type="indexterm"}

The `full-width` option []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797027669040
primary="full-width keyword, text-transform"
data-type="indexterm"}forces the writing of a character inside a square.
Most characters you can type on a keyboard come in both normal width and
full width, with different Unicode code points. The full-width version
is used when `full-width` is set and supported to mix them smoothly with
Asian ideographic characters, allowing ideograms and Latin scripts to be
aligned.

Generally used with `<ruby>` annotation text, `full-size-kana` converts
all small Kana characters to the equivalent full-size Kana, to
compensate for legibility issues at the small font sizes typically used
in Ruby.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797027646336 primary=""

Next we []{#ch15.xhtml_ix_text_decor primary="text properties"
secondary="text decoration" data-type="indexterm"}come to the topic of
text decorations, and how we can affect them with various properties.
The simplest text decoration, and the one that can be controlled the
most, is an underline. CSS also supports overlines, line-throughs, and
even the wavy underlines you see in word processing programs to flag
errors of spelling or grammar.

We'll start with the various individual properties, and then tie it all
up with a shorthand property, `text-decoration`, that covers them all.

With the []{#ch15.xhtml_ix_text_decor_line_prop
primary="text-decoration-line property" data-type="indexterm"}property
`text-decoration-line`, you can set the location of one or more line
decorations on a run of text. The most familiar decoration may be
underlining, thanks to all the hyperlinks out there, but CSS has three
possible visible decoration line values (plus an unsupported fourth that
wouldn't draw a line at all even if it *was* supported).

The []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797027595536 primary="underlining text"
data-type="indexterm"}values are relatively self-documenting:
`underline` places a line under the text, where *under* means "below the
text in the block direction." The `overline` value is the mirror image,
putting the line above the text in the block direction. The
`line-through` value draws a line through the middle of the text.

Let's see what these decorations look like in practice. The following
code is illustrated in
[Figure 15-24](#ch15.xhtml_various_kinds_of_text_decoration){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p.one {text-decoration: underline;}
p.two {text-decoration: overline;}
p.three {text-decoration: line-through;}
p.four {text-decoration: none;}
```

</span>Various kinds of text decoration</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The value `none` turns off any decoration that might otherwise have been
applied to an element. For example, links are usually underlined by
default. If you want to suppress the underlining of hyperlinks, you can
use the following CSS rule to do so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a {text-decoration: none;}
```

If you explicitly turn off link underlining with this sort of rule, the
only visual difference between the anchors and normal text will be their
color (at least by default, though there's no ironclad guarantee that
there will be a difference in their colors). Relying on color alone as
the difference between regular text and links within that text is not
enough to differentiate links from the rest of the text, negatively
impacting user experience and making your content inaccessible to many
users.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1419}

Bear in mind that many users will be annoyed when they realize you've
turned off link underlining, especially within blocks of text. If your
links aren't underlined, users will have a hard time finding hyperlinks
in your documents, and finding them can be next to impossible for users
with one form or another of color blindness.

That's really all there is to `text-decoration-line`. The more veteran
among you may recognize this is what `text-decoration` itself used to
do, but times have moved on and there's much, much more we can do with
decorations besides just place them, so these values were shifted to
`text-decoration-line`.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797027559728 primary=""

You can use any valid color value for `text-decoration-color`, including
the keyword `currentcolor` (which is the default). Suppose you want to
make it clear that stricken text really is stricken. That would go
something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
del, strike, .removed {
	text-decoration-line: line-through;
	text-decoration-color: red;
}
```

Thus, not only will the elements shown get a line-through decoration,
but the line will also be colored red. The text itself will not be red
unless you change that as well by using the `color` property.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1422}

Remember to keep the color contrast between decorations and the base
text sufficiently high to remain accessible. It's also generally a bad
idea to use color alone to convey meaning, as in "check the links with
red underlines for more information!"

Supplying a length value sets the thickness of the decoration to that
length; thus, `text-decoration-thickness: 3px` sets the decoration to be
3 pixels thick, no matter how big or small the text itself might be. A
better approach is generally to use an em-based value or jump straight
to using a percentage value, since percentages are calculated with
respect to the value of `1em` for the element. Thus,
`text-decoration-thickness: 10%` would yield a decoration thickness of
1.6 pixels in a font whose computed font size is 16 pixels, but 4 pixels
for a 40-pixel font size. The following code shows a few examples, which
are illustrated in
[Figure 15-25](#ch15.xhtml_various_decoration_thicknesses){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1, p {text-decoration-line: underline;}
.tiny {text-decoration-thickness: 1px;}
.embased {text-decoration-thickness: 0.333em;}
.percent {text-decoration-thickness: 10%;}
```

The keyword `from-font` is interesting because it allows the browser to
consult the font file to see whether it defines a preferred decoration
thickness; if it does, the browser uses that thickness. If the font file
doesn't recommend a thickness, the browser falls back to the `auto`
behavior and picks whatever thickness it thinks appropriate, using
inscrutable reasoning known only to itself.

The exact result will depend on the value you pick and the browser you

With the `text-decoration` shorthand property, you can bring everything
into one place, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {text-decoration: overline purple 10%;}
a:any-link {text-decoration: underline currentcolor from-font;}
```

Be careful, though: if you have two different decorations matched to the
same element, the value of the rule that wins out will completely
replace the value of the loser. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2.stricken {text-decoration: line-through wavy;}
h2 {text-decoration: underline overline double;}
```

Given these rules, any `<h2>` element with a class of `stricken` will
have only a wavy line-through decoration. The doubled underline and
overline decorations are lost, since shorthand values replace one
another instead of accumulating.

Note also that because of the way the decoration properties work, you
can set the color and style only once per element, even if you have
multiple decorations. For example, the following is valid, setting both
the under- and overlines to be green and dotted:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
text-decoration: dotted green underline overline;
```

If you instead want the overline to be a different color than the
underline, or set each to have its own style, you'd need to apply each
to a separate element, something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-decoration: dotted green overline;}
p > span:first-child {text-decoration: silver dashed underline;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<p><span>All this text will have differing text decorations.</span></p>

away from the text's baseline, so that they're a little more obvious to

As with `text-decoration-thickness`, percentage values for
`text-underline-offset` are calculated with respect to the value of
`1em` for the element. Thus, `text-underline-offset: 10%` would cause an
offset of 1.6 pixels in a font whose computed font size is [16

When ink skipping is turned on, the decoration is interrupted wherever
it would cross over the shapes of the text. Usually, this means a small
gap between the decoration and the text glyphs. See

## Understanding Weird Decorations {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1439}

Now, let's []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026879552 primary="inheritance"
secondary="text decoration's lack of" data-type="indexterm"}look into
the unusual side of `text-decoration`. The first oddity is that
`text-decoration` is *not* inherited. No inheritance implies that any
decoration lines drawn with the text---whether under, over, or through
it---will always be the same color. This is true even if the descendant
elements are a different color, as depicted in
[Figure 15-29](#ch15.xhtml_color_consistency_in_underlines){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-decoration: underline; color: black;}
strong {color: gray;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>This paragraph, which is black and has a black underline, also contains
<strong>strongly emphasized text</strong> that has the black underline
beneath it as well.</p>
```

<h6 id="ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1440"><span class="label">Figure 15-29.
</span>Color consistency in underlines</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Why is this so? Because the value of `text-decoration` is not inherited,
the `<strong>` element assumes a default value of `none`. Therefore, the
`<strong>` element has *no* underline. Now, there is very clearly a line
under the `<strong>` element, so it seems silly to say that it has none.
Nevertheless, it doesn't. What you see under the `<strong>` element is
the paragraph's underline, which is effectively "spanning" the
`<strong>` element. You can see it more clearly if you alter the styles
for the boldfaced element, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-decoration: underline; color: black;}
strong {color: gray; text-decoration: none;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>This paragraph, which is black and has a black underline, also contains
<strong>strongly emphasized text</strong> that has the black underline beneath
it as well.</p>
```

The result is identical to the one shown in
[Figure 15-29](#ch15.xhtml_color_consistency_in_underlines){data-type="xref"},
since all you've done is to explicitly declare what was already the
case. In other words, there is no way to "turn off" the decoration
generated by a parent element.

There is a way to []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026758688 primary="colors"
secondary="text decoration" data-type="indexterm"}change the color of a
decoration without violating the specification. As you'll recall,
setting a text decoration on an element means that the entire element
has the same color decoration, even if child elements have different
colors. To match the decoration color with an element, you must
explicitly declare its decoration, as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-decoration: underline; color: black;}
strong {color: silver; text-decoration: underline;} /*could also use 'inherit'*/
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>This paragraph, which is black and has a black underline, also contains
<strong>strongly emphasized text</strong> that has the black underline
beneath it as well, but whose gray underline overlays the black underline
of its parent.</p>
```

In
[Figure 15-30](#ch15.xhtml_overcoming_the_default_behavior_of_under){data-type="xref"},
the `<strong>` element is set to be gray and to have an underline. The
gray underline visually "overwrites" the parent's black underline, so
the decoration's color matches the color of the `<strong>` element. The
black underline is still there; the gray underline is just hiding it. If
you move the gray underline with `text-underline-offset` or make the
parent's `text-decoration-thickness` wider than its child, both
underlines will be visible.

primary="vertical-align property" secondary="in text"
secondary-sortas="text" data-type="indexterm"}combined with
`vertical-align`, even stranger things can happen.
[Figure 15-31](#ch15.xhtml_correct_comma_although_strange_comma_dec){data-type="xref"}
shows one of these oddities. Since the `<sup>` element has no decoration
of its own, but it is elevated within an overlined element, the overline
should cut through the middle of the `<sup>` element:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-decoration: overline; font-size: 12pt;}
sup {vertical-align: 50%; font-size: 12pt;}

###### Note {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1446}

Some user agents will always optimize for legibility, even when

having gotten so fast in the past few years.
:::

The []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026547696
primary="geometricPrecision keyword, text-rendering"
data-type="indexterm"}value `geometricPrecision`, on the other hand,
directs the user agent to draw the text as precisely as possible, such
that it could be scaled up or down with no loss of fidelity. You might
think that this is always the case, but not so. Some fonts change
kerning or ligature effects at different text sizes, for example,
providing more kerning space at smaller sizes and tightening up the
kerning space as the size is increased. With `geometricPrecision`, those
hints are ignored as the text size changes. If it helps, think of it as
the user agent drawing the text as though all the text is a series of
SVG paths, not font glyphs.

Even by the usual []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026545616 primary="SVG format"

The default is to not have a drop shadow for text. Otherwise, you can
define one or more shadows. Each shadow is defined by an optional color
and three length values, the last of which is also optional.

The []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026520656 primary="currentcolor keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}color sets the shadow's color so it's possible to
define green, purple, or even white shadows. If the color is omitted,
the shadow defaults to the color keyword `currentcolor`, making it the
same color as the text itself.

Using `currentcolor` as a default color may seem counterintuitive, as
you might think shadows are purely decorative, but shadows can be used
to improve legibility. A small shadow can make very thin text more
legible. Defaulting to `currentcolor` allows adding thickness via a
shadow that will always match the color of the text.

In addition to improving accessibility by making thin text thicker,
shadows can be used to improve color contrast with a multicolored
background. For example, if you have white text on a mostly dark
black-and-white photo, adding a black shadow to the white text makes the
edges of the white text visible even if the text is laid over white
portions of the image.

The first two length values determine the offset distance of the shadow
from the text; the first is the horizontal offset, and the second is the
vertical offset. To define a solid, unblurred green shadow offset 5
pixels to the right and half an em down from the text, as shown in
[Figure 15-33](#ch15.xhtml_simple_shadows){data-type="xref"}, you could
write either of the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
text-shadow: green 5px 0.5em;
text-shadow: 5px 0.5em green;
```

Negative lengths cause the shadow to be offset to the left and upward
from the original text. The following, also shown in
[Figure 15-33](#ch15.xhtml_simple_shadows){data-type="xref"}, places a
light-blue shadow 5 pixels to the left and half an em above the text:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
text-shadow: rgb(128,128,255) −5px −0.5em;
```

</span>Simple shadows</h6>
</div>
</figure>

While the offset may make the text take more visual space, shadows have
no effect on line height and therefore no impact on the box model.

The []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026491584 primary="blur radius"
secondary="text shadow" data-type="indexterm"}optional third length
value defines a blur radius for the shadow. The *blur radius* is defined
as the distance from the shadow's outline to the edge of the blurring
effect. A radius of 2 pixels would result in blurring that fills the
space between the shadow's outline and the edge of the blurring. The
exact blurring method is not defined, so different user agents might
employ different effects. As an example, the following styles are
rendered as shown in
[Figure 15-34](#ch15.xhtml_dropping_shadows_all_over){data-type="xref"}:

  : [Table 15-1. ]{.label}The predefined emphasis marks
  {#predefined_emphasis_marks}

The sesame is the most common mark used in vertical writing modes; the
circle is the usual default in horizontal writing modes.

If the emphasis marks will not fit into the current text line's height,
they will cause the height of that line of text to be increased until
they fit without overlapping other lines. Unlike text decorations and
text shadows, text emphasis marks *do* affect the line height.

If none of the predefined marks work in your specific situation, you can
supply your own character as a string (a single character in single or
double quotes). However, be careful: if the string is more than a single
character, it may be reduced to the first character in the string by the
browser. Thus, `text-emphasis-style: 'cool'` may result in the browser
displaying only the `c` as a mark, as shown in
[Figure 15-35](#ch15.xhtml_various_emphasis_marks){data-type="xref"}.
Furthermore, the string symbols may or may not be rotated to match
writing direction in vertical languages.

Here are some examples of setting emphasis marks:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 em {text-emphasis-style: triangle;}
strong a:any-link {text-emphasis-style: filled sesame;}
strong.callout {text-emphasis-style: open double-circle;}
```

A key difference between text emphasis and text decoration is that
unlike decoration, emphasis is inherited. In other words, if you set a
style of `filled sesame` on a paragraph, and that paragraph has child
elements like links, those child elements will inherit the
[`filled sesame`]{.keep-together} value.

Another difference is that every glyph (character or other symbol) gets
its own mark, and these marks are centered on the glyph. Thus, in
proportional fonts like those seen in
[Figure 15-35](#ch15.xhtml_various_emphasis_marks){data-type="xref"},
the marks will have different separations between them depending on
which two glyphs are next to each other.

The CSS specification recommends that emphasis marks be half the size of
the text's font size, as if they were given `font-size: 50%`. They
should otherwise use the same text styles as the text; thus, if the text
is boldfaced, the emphasis marks should be as well. They should also use
the text's color, unless overridden with the next property we'll
cover.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026251824 primary=""

The default value, as is often the case with color-related properties,
is `currentcolor`. That ensures that emphasis marks will match the color
of the text by default. To change it, you can do things like the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

emphasis marks in specific positions: above each glyph in horizontal

`text-emphasis-position` property allows you to change where marks are
placed.

The values `over` and `under` are applied only when the typographic mode
is horizontal. Similarly, `right` and `left` are used only when the
typographic mode is vertical.

This can be []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026122208
primary="CJK or CJKV text characters" data-type="indexterm"}important in
some Eastern languages. For example, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and
Mongolian all prefer to have marks to the right when the text is written
vertically. They diverge on horizontal text: Chinese prefers marks below
the text, and the rest prefer above the text, when it's horizontal. Thus
you might write something like this in a stylesheet:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
:lang(cn) {text-emphasis-position: under right;}
```

This would override the default `over right` when the text is marked as
being Chinese, applying `under right` instead.

The reason `text-emphasis-position` is not included in the
`text-emphasis` shorthand is so that it can (indeed must) be inherited
separately. Therefore, the style and color of the marks can be changed
via `text-emphasis` without overriding the position in the process.

As []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026067072 primary="typographic character unit"

other glyph---what CSS calls a *typographic character unit*---gets its
own emphasis mark. That is roughly correct, but exceptions occur. The
following character units do *not* get emphasis marks:

-   Word separators such as spaces, or any other Unicode separator
    character

-   Punctuation characters, such as commas, full stops, and parentheses

-   Unicode symbols corresponding to control codes, or any unassigned

Browsers are []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797026060496
primary="drawing order, text" data-type="indexterm"}supposed to use a
specific order to draw the text decorations, shadows, and emphasis marks
we've discussed previously, along with the text itself. These are drawn
in the following order, from bottommost (furthest away from the user) to
topmost (closest to the user):

1.  Shadows (`text-shadow`)

2.  Underlines (`text-decoration`)

3.  Overlines (`text-decoration`)

4.  The actual text

5.  Emphasis marks (`text-emphasis`)

6.  Line-through (`text-decoration`)

Thus, the drop shadows of the text are placed behind everything else.
Underlines and overlines go behind the text. Emphasis marks and
line-throughs go on top of the text. Note that if you have top
text-emphasis marks and an overline, the emphasis marks will be drawn on
top of the overline, obfuscating the overline where they

```{=html}
</aside>
```
By using the `white-space` property, you can affect how a browser treats
the whitespace between words and lines of text. To a certain extent,
default HTML handling already does this: it collapses any whitespace
down to a single space. So given the following markup, the rendering in
a web browser would show only one space between each word and ignore the
line feed in the elements:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>This    paragraph   has     many spaces        in it.</p>
```

You can explicitly set this default behavior with the following
declaration:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {white-space: normal;}
```

This rule tells the browser to do as browsers have always done: discard
extra whitespace. Given this value, line-feed characters (carriage
returns) are converted into spaces, and any sequence of more than one
space in a row is converted to a single space.

Should you set `white-space` to `pre`, however, the whitespace in an
affected element is treated as though the elements were HTML `<pre>`
elements; whitespace is *not* ignored, as shown in
[Figure 15-36](#ch15.xhtml_honoring_the_spaces_in_markup){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {white-space: pre;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p>This    paragraph   has     many
    spaces        in it.</p>
```

</span>Honoring the spaces in markup</h6>
</div>
</figure>

With a `white-space` value of `pre`, the browser will pay attention to
extra spaces and even carriage returns. In this respect, any element can
be made to act like a `<pre>` element.

The []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025930512 primary="wrapping text"
data-type="indexterm"}opposite value is `nowrap`, which prevents text
from wrapping within an element, except wherever you use a `<br>`
element. When text can't wrap and it gets too wide for its container, a
horizontal scrollbar will appear by default (this can be changed using
the `overflow` property). The effects of the following markup are shown
in
[Figure 15-37](#ch15.xhtml_suppressing_line_wrapping_with_the_white){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<p style="white-space: nowrap;">This paragraph is not allowed to wrap,
which means that the only way to end a line is to insert a line-break
element.  If no such element is inserted, then the line will go forever,
forcing the user to scroll horizontally to read whatever can't be
initially displayed <br/>in the browser window.</p>
```

If an element is set to `pre-wrap`, text within that element has
whitespace sequences preserved, but text lines are wrapped normally.
With this value, generated linebreaks as well as those found in the
source markup are both honored.

The `pre-line` value is []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025888704
primary="breaks" secondary="line"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025887696

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025887024
primary="text properties" secondary="line breaks"
data-type="indexterm"}the opposite of `pre-wrap` and causes whitespace
sequences to collapse as in normal text but honors new lines.

The `break-spaces` value is similar to `pre-wrap`, except that all
whitespace is preserved, even at the end of the line, with a line-break
opportunity after each whitespace character. These spaces take up space
and do not hang, and thus affect the box's intrinsic sizes (min-content
size and max-content size).

[Table 15-2](#ch15.xhtml_white-space_properties){data-type="xref"}

Consider the following markup, which has line-feed (e.g., return)
characters to break lines, plus the end of each line has several extra
space characters that aren't visible in the markup. The results are
illustrated in

Notice that the third paragraph has a blank line between the first and
second lines of text. This is because a line wrap was performed between
two adjacent blank spaces at the end of the line in the source markup.
This didn't happen for `pre-wrap` or `pre-line`, because those
`white-space` values don't allow hanging space to create line-wrap
opportunities. The `break-spaces` value does.

Whitespace impacts several properties, including `tab-size`, which has
no effect when the `white-space` property is set to a value in which
whitespace is not maintained; and `overflow-wrap`, which has an effect
only when `white-space` allows wrapping.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025808720

Since []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025805776 primary="tab-size property"
data-type="indexterm"}whitespace is preserved in some values of
`white-space`, it stands to reason that tabs (i.e., Unicode code point
0009) will be displayed as, well, tabs. But how many spaces should each
tab equal? That's where `tab-size` comes in.

```
By default, when whitespace is preserved, as with `white-space` values
of `pre`, `pre-wrap`, and `break-spaces`, any tab character will be
treated the same as eight spaces in a row, including any effects from
`letter-spacing` and `word-spacing`. You can alter that by using a
different integer value. Thus, `tab-size: 4` will cause each tab to be
rendered as if it were four spaces in a row. Negative values are not
allowed for `tab-size`.

If a length value is supplied, each tab is rendered using that length.
For example, `tab-size: 10px` will cause a sequence of three tabs to be
rendered as 30 pixels of whitespace. Some effects of `tab-size` are
illustrated in
[Figure 15-39](#ch15.xhtml_differing_tab_lengths){data-type="xref"}.

Remember that `tab-size` is effectively ignored when the value of
`white-space` causes whitespace to be collapsed (see
[Table 15-2](#ch15.xhtml_white-space_properties){data-type="xref"}). The
value will still be computed in such cases, but there will be no visible
effect no matter how many tabs appear in the

If you do choose to hyphenate, be careful about the elements to which
you apply the hyphenation. The `hyphens` property is inherited, so
declaring `body {hyphens: auto;}` will apply hyphenation to everything
in your document---including text areas, code samples, block quotes, and
so on. Blocking automatic hyphenation at the level of those elements is
probably a good idea, using rules that are something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {hyphens: auto;}
code, var, kbd, samp, tt, dir, listing, plaintext, xmp, abbr, acronym,
blockquote, q, textarea, input, option {hyphens: manual;}
```

It's usually a good idea to suppress hyphenation in code samples and
code blocks, especially in languages that use hyphens in things like
property and value names. (Ahem.) Similar logic holds for keyboard input
text---you likely don't want a stray dash getting into your Unix
command-line examples! And so on down the line. If you decide that you
want to hyphenate some of these elements, just remove them from the
selector.

```
The default value of `normal` means that text should be wrapped as it
always has been. In practical terms, this means that text is broken
between words, though the definition of a word varies by language. In
Latin-derived languages like English, this is almost always a space
between letter sequences (e.g., words) or at hyphens. In ideographic
languages like Japanese, each symbol can be a complete word, so breaks
can occur between any two symbols. In other ideographic languages,
though, the soft-wrap points may be limited to appear between sequences
of symbols that are not space separated. Again, that's all by default
and is the way browsers have handled text for years.

If you apply the value `break-all`, soft wrapping can (and will) occur
between any two characters, even if they are in the middle of a word.
With this value, no hyphens are shown, even if the soft wrapping occurs
at a hyphenation point (see
["Hyphenation"](#ch15.xhtml_hyphenation){data-type="xref"}). Note that
values of the `line-break` property (described next) can affect the
behavior of `break-all` in ideographic text.

The `keep-all` value, on the other hand, suppresses soft wrapping
between characters, even in ideographic languages where each symbol is a
word. Thus, in Japanese, a sequence of symbols with no whitespace will
not be soft wrapped, even if this means the text line will exceed the
length of its element. (This behavior is similar to `white-space: pre`.)

As you just saw, `word-break` can affect the way lines of text are soft
wrapped in []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025418272
primary="CJK or CJKV text characters" data-type="indexterm"}CJK text.
The `line-break` property also affects such soft wrapping, specifically
how wrapping is handled around CJK-specific symbols and around non-CJK
punctuation (such as exclamation points, hyphens, and ellipses) that
appears in text declared to be CJK.

In other words, `line-break` applies to certain CJK characters all the
time, regardless of the content's declared language. If you throw some
CJK characters into a paragraph of English text, `line-break` will still
apply to them, but not to anything else in the text. Conversely, if you
declare content to be in a CJK language, `line-break` will continue to
apply to those CJK characters *plus* a number of non-CJK characters
within the CJK text. These include punctuation marks, currency symbols,
and a few other symbols.

No authoritative list exists of which characters are affected and which
are not, but [the specification](http://w3.org/TR/css3-text/#line-break)
provides a list of recommended symbols and behaviors around those
symbols.

The default value `auto` allows user agents to soft wrap text as they
like, and more importantly lets user agents vary line breaking based on
the situation. For example, the user agent can use looser line-breaking
rules for short lines of text and stricter rules for long lines. In
effect, `auto` allows the user agent to switch among the `loose`,
`normal`, and `strict` values as needed, possibly even on a line-by-line
basis within a single element.

You can perhaps infer that those other values have the following general
meanings:

`loose`

:   This []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025408608
    primary="loose keyword, line-break" data-type="indexterm"}value
    imposes the "least restrictive" rules for wrapping text, and is
    meant for use when line lengths are short, such as in newspapers.

`normal`

:   This value imposes the "most common" rules for wrapping text. What
    exactly "most common" means is not precisely defined, though there
    is the aforementioned list of recommended behaviors.

`strict`

:   This []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025404928
    primary="strict keyword, line-break" data-type="indexterm"}value
    imposes the "most stringent" rules for wrapping text. Again, this is
    not precisely defined.

`anywhere`

:   This []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025402576
    primary="anywhere keyword, line-break" data-type="indexterm"}value
    creates a line-breaking opportunity around every typographic unit,
    including whitespace and punctuation marks. A soft wrap can even
    happen in the middle of a word, and hyphenation is not applied in
    such circumstances.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025401696 primary=""

primary="soft-wrapping of text" data-type="indexterm"}information about
hyphenation and soft wrapping, what happens when text overflows its
container anyway? That's what `overflow-wrap` addresses.

Originally called `word-wrap`, the `overflow-wrap` property applies to
inline elements, setting whether the browser should insert line breaks
within otherwise unbreakable strings in order to prevent text from
overflowing its line box. In contrast to `word-break`, `overflow-wrap`
will create a break only if an entire word cannot be placed on its own
line without overflowing.

This property is less straightforward than it first appears, because its
primary effect is to change how word wrapping and minimum-content sizing
(which we haven't even had a chance to discuss yet) interact in trying
to avoid overflow at the ends of text lines.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1484}

The `overflow-wrap` []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025376784
primary="whitespace" secondary="in text" secondary-sortas="text"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025375504
primary="white-space property" data-type="indexterm"}property can
operate only if the value of `white-space` allows line wrapping. If it
does not (e.g., with the value `pre`), `overflow-wrap` has no effect.
:::

If the default value of `normal` is in effect, wrapping happens as
normal---between words or as directed by the language. If a word is
longer than the width of the element containing it, the word will "spill
out" of the element box, just as on the classic CSS IS AWESOME coffee
mug. (Google it if you haven't seen it before. It's worth the chuckle.)

If the `break-word` value is applied, wrapping can happen in the middle
of words, with no hyphen placed at the site of the wrapping, but this
will happen so that line lengths will be as wide as the element's width.
In other words, if the `width` property of the element is given the
value `min-content`, the "minimum content" calculations will assume that
content strings must be as long as possible.

By contrast, when `anywhere` is set, the "minimum content" calculations
will take line-wrapping opportunities into account. This means, in
effect, that the minimum-content width will be the width of the widest
character in the element's content. Only when two skinny characters are
next to each other will they have a chance to be on the same line
together, and in a monospace font every line of text will be a single
character.
[Figure 15-42](#ch15.xhtml_overflow_wrapping){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the difference between these three values.

<figure>
<div id="ch15.xhtml_overflow_wrapping" class="figure">

</span>Overflow wrapping for <code>width: min-content</code></h6>
</div>
</figure>

If the value of `width` is something other than `min-content`, then
`break-word` and `anywhere` will have the same results. Really, the only
difference between the two values is that with `anywhere`, soft-wrap
opportunities introduced by the word break are considered when
calculating min-content intrinsic sizes. With `break-word`, they are not
considered.

While `overflow-wrap: break-word` may appear very similar to
`word-break: break-all`, they are not the same. To see why, compare the
second box in
[Figure 15-42](#ch15.xhtml_overflow_wrapping){data-type="xref"} to the
top-middle box in
[Figure 15-41](#ch15.xhtml_altering_word_breaking_behavior){data-type="xref"}.
As it shows, `overflow-wrap` kicks in only if content actually
overflows; thus, when there is an opportunity to use whitespace in the
source to wrap lines, `overflow-wrap` will take it. By contrast,
`word-break: break-all` will cause wrapping when content reaches the
wrapping edge, regardless of any whitespace that comes earlier in the
line.

Once upon a time there was a property called `word-wrap` that did
exactly what `overflow-wrap` does. The two are so identical that the
specification explicitly states that user agents "must treat `word-wrap`
as an alternate name for the `overflow-wrap` property, as if it were a
shorthand of `overflow-wrap`."[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025356256

including the `lang` attribute in your HTML, from being able to style

Generally, you should let the user agent handle the direction of text
based on the language attribute, but CSS does provide properties for the
rare occasions when an override is necessary.

The default value, `horizontal-tb`, means "a horizontal inline
direction, and a top-to-bottom block direction." This covers all Western
and some Middle Eastern languages, which may differ in the direction of
their horizontal writing. The other two values offer a vertical inline
direction, and either an RTL or LTR block direction.

The `sideways-rl` and `sideways-lr` values take horizontal text and turn
its flow "sideways," with the direction the text runs either going right
to left (for `sidewyas-rl`) or left to right (for `sideways-lr`). The
difference between these values and the vertical values is that the text
is turned whichever way is necessary to make the text read naturally.

[Figure 15-43](#ch15.xhtml_writing_modes){data-type="xref"} illustrates
all five values.

Notice how the lines are strung together in the two `vertical-`
examples. If you tilt your head to the right, the text in `vertical-rl`
is at least readable. The text in `vertical-lr`, on the other hand, is
difficult to read because it appears to flow from bottom to top, at
least when arranging English text. This is not a problem in languages
that use `vertical-lr` flow, such as forms of Japanese.

In vertical writing modes, the block direction is horizontal, which
means vertical alignment of inline elements causes them to move
horizontally. This is illustrated in
[Figure 15-44](#ch15.xhtml_writing_modes_vertical_align){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch15.xhtml_writing_modes_vertical_align" class="figure">

</span>Writing modes and “vertical” alignment</h6>
</div>
</figure>

All the super- and subscript elements cause horizontal shifts, both of
themselves and the placement of the lines they occupy, even though the
property used to move them is `vertical-align`. As described earlier,
the vertical displacement is with respect to the line box, where the
box's baseline is defined as horizontal---even when it's being drawn
[vertically.]{.keep-together}

Confused? It's OK. Writing modes are likely to confuse you, because
they're such a different way of thinking *and* because old assumptions
in the CSS specification clash with the new capabilities. If vertical
writing modes had been supported from the outset, `vertical-align` would
likely have a different name---`inline-align` or something like that.

Only []{#ch15.xhtml_ix_text_combine_up
primary="text-combine-upright property" data-type="indexterm"}relevant
to vertical writing modes, the `text-combine-upright` property enables
displaying a subset of characters upright within vertical text. This can
be useful when mixing languages or pieces of languages, such as
embedding Arabic numerals in CJK text, but may have other applications.

Essentially, this property lets you say whether characters may sit next
to each other horizontally while being part of a vertical line of text.
Your choices are whether to allow this for all characters or for only a
few numeric digits.

Here's how it works: as a line of vertical text is laid out, the browser
can consider whether the width of two characters, sitting next to each
other, is less than or equal to the value of `1em` for the text. If so,
they may be placed next to each other, effectively putting two
characters into the space of one. If not, the first character is placed
alone, and the process [continues.]{.keep-together}

As of mid-2022, this can lead to characters being very, very squished.
For an example, consider the following markup and CSS:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<div lang="zh-Hant">
<p>这是一些文本</p>
<p class="combine">这是一些文本</p>
<p>这是117一些0文本23日</p>
<p class="combine">这是117一些0文本23日</p>
<p class="combine">
   这是<span>117</span>一些<span>0</span>文本<span>23</span>日</p>
<p>这是<span class="combine">117</span>一些<span
   class="combine">0</span>文本<span class="combine">23</span>日</p>
</div>
```

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {writing-mode: vertical-rl;}
.combine {text-combine-upright: all;}
```

All of the paragraphs are written using `writing-mode: vertical-rl`, but
some are set to `text-combine-upright: all`, and others are not. The
last paragraph is not set to `all`, but the `<span>` elements within it
have been.
[Figure 15-46](#ch15.xhtml_various_types_of_upright_combination){data-type="xref"}
shows the result.

<h6 id="ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1497"><span class="label">Figure 15-46.
</span>Various types of upright combination</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Lest you think a bug is at work here, the results are consistent across
browsers (as of mid-2022). The second and fourth columns have every
single character, whether Chinese ideographs or Arabic numerals,
squished horizontally to fit on a single line.

A way around this is to break up the text with child elements, as shown
in the fifth and sixth columns. In the first, numbers are surrounded
with `<span>` elements, which break up the fitting process. This works
as long as no run of text has too many characters; beyond two or three
symbols, the text becomes progressively more difficult to comprehend.

The sixth column shows a way to hack around the problem: apply
`text-combine-upright: all` to only the `<span>` elements, which are
already used to wrap the Arabic numerals, by giving each `<span>` a
`class` value of `combine`. In that case, the `.combine` rule will apply
only to the `<span>` elements, not all the text in the paragraph.

This is what the `digits` value is supposed to make possible without the
need for all the extra markup. Theoretically, you could get the same
result as that shown in the sixth column of
[Figure 15-46](#ch15.xhtml_various_types_of_upright_combination){data-type="xref"}
by applying the following CSS to the paragraph that has no `<span>`
elements in it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {writing-mode: vertical-rl; text-upright-combine: digits 4;}
```

Sadly, as of mid-2022, no browser supports this behavior, unless you
count Internet Explorer 11 using the alternate property name
`-ms-text-combine-horizontal`.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025038896

Harking back to the days of []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025018368
primary="CSS2 specification" secondary="direction of text"
data-type="indexterm"}CSS2, a pair of properties could be used to affect
the direction of text by changing the inline baseline direction:
`direction` and `unicode-bidi`. []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797025016304
primary="direction property" data-type="indexterm"}These should
generally not be used today, but are covered here in case you come
across them in legacy code.

###### Warning {#ch15.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1499}

The CSS specification explicitly warns *against* using `direction` and
`unicode-bidi` in CSS when applied to HTML documents. To quote: "Because
HTML \[user agents\] can turn off CSS styling, we recommend...the HTML
`dir` attribute and `<bdo>` element to ensure correct bidirectional
layout in the absence of a style sheet."

The `direction` property affects the writing direction of text in a
block-level element, the direction of table-column layout, the direction
in which content horizontally overflows its element box, and the
position of the last line of a fully justified element. For inline
elements, direction applies only if the property `unicode-bidi` is set
to either `embed` or `bidi-override` (see the following description of
`unicode-bidi`).

Although `ltr` is the default, it is expected that if a browser is
displaying RTL text, the value will be changed to `rtl`. Thus, a browser
might carry an internal rule stating something like the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*:lang(ar), *:lang(he) {direction: rtl;}
```

The real rule would be longer and encompass all RTL languages, not just
Arabic and Hebrew, but it illustrates the point.

While []{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797024955648 primary="unicode-bidi property"
data-type="indexterm"}CSS attempts to address writing direction, Unicode
has a much more robust method for handling directionality. With the
property `unicode-bidi`, CSS authors can take advantage of some of
Unicode's capabilities.

Here we'll simply quote the value descriptions from the CSS 2.1
specification, which do a good job of capturing the essence of each
value:

`normal`

:   The element does not open an additional level of embedding with
    respect to the bidirectional algorithm. For inline-level elements,
    implicit reordering works across element boundaries.

`embed`

:   If the element is inline-level, this value opens an additional level
    of embedding with respect to the bidirectional algorithm. The
    direction of this embedding level is given by the `direction`
    property. Inside the element, reordering is done implicitly. This
    corresponds to adding a "left-to-right embedding" character (U+202A;
    for `direction: ltr`) or a "right-to-left embedding" character
    (U+202B; for `direction: rtl`) at the start of the element and a
    "pop directional formatting" character (U+202C) at the end of the
    element.

`bidi-override`

:   This creates an override for inline-level elements. For block-level
    elements, this creates an override for inline-level descendants not
    within another block. This means that, inside the element,
    reordering is strictly in sequence according to the `direction`
    property; the implicit part of the bidirectional algorithm is
    ignored. This corresponds to adding a "left-to-right override"
    character (U+202D; for `direction: ltr`) or "right-to-left override"
    character (U+202E; for `direction: rtl`) at the start of the element
    and a "pop directional formatting" character (U+202C) at the end of
    [the element]{.keep-together}.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797024914032
    primary="" startref="ix_text_write_mode"

Even without altering the font face, we have many ways to change the
appearance of text.[]{#ch15.xhtml_idm45797024910384 primary=""
startref="ix_text_properties_ch15" data-type="indexterm"} In addition to
classic effects such as underlining, CSS enables you to draw lines over
text or through it, change the amount of space between words and
letters, indent the first line of a paragraph (or other block-level
element), align text in various ways, exert influence over the
hyphenation and line breaking of text, and much more. You can even alter
the amount of space between lines of text. CSS also supports languages
other than those that are written left to right, top to bottom. Given
that so much of the web is text, the strength of these properties makes
a great deal of sense.

# [Chapter 16. ]{.label}Lists and Generated Content

In the realm of CSS layout, []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_lists_ch16 primary="lists"
data-type="indexterm"}lists are an interesting case. The items in a list
are simply block boxes, but with an extra bit that doesn't really
participate in the document layout hanging off to one side. With an
ordered list, that extra bit contains a series of increasing numbers (or
letters) that are calculated and mostly formatted by the user agent, not
the author. Taking a cue from the document structure, the user agent
generates the numbers and their basic presentation.

With CSS, you can define your own counting patterns and formats, and
associate those counters with *any* element, not just ordered list
items. Furthermore, this basic mechanism makes it possible to insert
other kinds of content, including text strings, attribute values, or
even external resources, into a document. Thus, it is possible to use
CSS to insert link icons, editorial symbols, and more into a design
without having to create extra markup.

To see how all these list options fit together, we'll explore basic list
styling before moving on to examine the generation of content and
counters.

# Working with Lists {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1503}

In a sense, almost anything that isn't narrative text can be considered
a list. The US Census, the solar system, my family tree, a restaurant
menu, and even all of the friends you've ever had can be represented as
a list, or perhaps as a list of lists. These many variations make lists
fairly important, which is why it's a shame that list styling in CSS
isn't more sophisticated.

The []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_markers_list_ch16 primary="markers, list"
data-type="indexterm"}simplest (and best-supported) way to affect a
list's styles is to change its marker type. The *marker* of a list item
is, for example, the bullet that appears next to each item in an
unordered list. In an ordered list, the marker could be a letter, a
number, or a symbol from some other counting system. You can even
replace the markers with images. All of these are accomplished using the
different list-style properties.

If you provide a counter style that the browser does not recognize, such
as declaring `list-style-type: lower-hexadecimal` and loading the page,
some browsers, including Firefox, Edge, and Chrome, will assume
`decimal` instead. Safari will ignore values it does not understand as
invalid.

The `list-style-type` property, as well as all other list-related
properties, can be applied only to an element that has a `display` of
`list-item`, but CSS doesn't distinguish between ordered and unordered
list items. Thus, you can set an ordered list to use discs instead of
numbers. In fact, the default value of `list-style-type` is `disc`, so
you might theorize that without explicit declarations to the contrary,
all lists (ordered or unordered) will use discs as the marker for each
item. This would be logical, but, as it turns out, it's up to the user
agent to decide. Even if the user agent doesn't have a predefined rule
such as `ol {list-style-type: decimal;}`, it may prohibit ordered
markers from being applied to unordered lists, and vice versa. You can't
count on this, so be careful.

If you want to suppress the display of markers altogether, you should
use `none`. This value causes the user agent to refrain from putting
anything where the marker would ordinarily be, although it does not
interrupt the counting in ordered lists. Thus, the following markup
would have the result shown in
[Figure 16-2](#ch16.xhtml_list-style-type-markersoff){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol li {list-style-type: decimal;}
li.off {list-style-type: none;}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<ol>
<li>Item the first
<li class="off">Item the second
<li>Item the third
<li class="off">Item the fourth
<li>Item the fifth
</ol>

The `list-style-type` property is inherited, so if you want to have
different styles of markers in nested lists, you'll likely need to
define them individually. You may also have to explicitly declare styles
for nested lists because the user agent's stylesheet may have already
defined them. For example, assume that a user agent has the following
styles defined:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {list-style-type: disc;}
ul ul {list-style-type: circle;}
ul ul ul {list-style-type: square;}
```

If this is the case---and it's likely that this, or something like it,
will be---you will have to declare your own styles to overcome the user
agent's styles. Inheritance won't be
enough.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797024721184 primary=""

CSS also allows []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797024673680 primary="markers, list"

Here's how it works:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul li {list-style-image: url(ohio.gif);}
```

Yes, it's really that simple. One simple `url()` value, and you're
putting images in for markers, as you can see in
[Figure 16-4](#ch16.xhtml_list-style-image){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">

List image markers are displayed at their full size, so exercise care in
the images you use, as the example shown in
[Figure 16-5](#ch16.xhtml_list-style-image-bigmarkers){data-type="xref"}
makes clear with its oversized markers:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul li {list-style-image: url(big-ohio.gif);}
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_list-style-image-bigmarkers" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1513"><span class="label">Figure 16-5.
</span>Using really big images as markers</h6>
</div>
</figure>

It's generally a good idea to provide a fallback marker type in case
your image doesn't load, gets corrupted, or is in a format that some
user agents can't display. Do this by defining a backup
`list-style-type` for the list:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul li {list-style-image: url(ohio.png); list-style-type: square;}
```

The other thing you can do with `list-style-image` is set it to the
default value of `none`. This is good practice because
`list-style-image` is inherited, so any nested lists will pick up the
image as the marker, unless you prevent that from happening:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {list-style-image: url(ohio.gif); list-style-type: square;}
ul ul {list-style-image: none;}
```

Since the nested list inherits the item type `square` but has been set
to use no image for its markers, squares are used for the markers in the
nested list, as shown in
[Figure 16-6](#ch16.xhtml_list-style-image-sublists){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">

Any []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797024429184 primary="gradients"

Gradient []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797024343984

thing you can do to change the appearance of list items: decide whether
the marker appears outside or inside the content of the list item. This
is accomplished with `list-style-position`.

If a marker's position is set to `outside` (the default), it will appear
the way list items have since the beginning of the web. Should you
desire a slightly different appearance, you can pull the marker in
toward the content by setting the value of `list-style-position` to
`inside`. This causes the marker to be placed "inside" the list item's
content. The exact way this happens is undefined, but
[Figure 16-8](#ch16.xhtml_list-style-position){data-type="xref"} shows
one possibility:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li.first {list-style-position: inside;}
li.second {list-style-position: outside;}

In practice, []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797024204384
primary="::marker pseudo-element" primary-sortas="marker pseudo-element"
data-type="indexterm"}markers given an `inside` placement are treated as
if they're an inline element inserted into the beginning of the list
item's content. This doesn't mean the markers *are* inline elements. You
can't style them separately from the rest of the element's content,
unless you wrap all the other content in an element like `<span>`, or
else address them directly (but with major limitations on what
properties are allowed) by using `::marker`. It's just that in layout
terms, that's what they act like.

For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li {list-style: url(ohio.gif) square inside;}
```

As shown in [Figure 16-9](#ch16.xhtml_list-style){data-type="xref"}, all
three values can be applied to list items at the same time.

The values for `list-style` can be listed in any order, and any can be
omitted. As long as one is present, the rest will fill in their default
values. For instance, the following two rules will have the same visual
effect:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li.norm {list-style: url(img42.gif);}
li.odd {list-style: url(img42.gif) disc outside;} /* the same thing */
```

They will also override any previous rules in the same way. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li {list-style-type: square;}
li {list-style: url(img42.gif);}
li {list-style: url(img42.gif) disc outside;} /* the same thing */
```

The result will be the same as that in
[Figure 16-9](#ch16.xhtml_list-style){data-type="xref"} because the
implied `list-style-type` value of `disc` will override the previous
declared value of `square`, just as the explicit value of `disc`
overrides it in the second rule.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797024055552

## List Layout {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1523}

Now []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_lists_layout primary="lists" secondary="layout of"
data-type="indexterm"}that we've looked at the basics of styling list
markers, let's consider how lists are laid out in various browsers.
We'll start with a set of three list items devoid of any markers and not
yet placed within a list, as shown in
[Figure 16-10](#ch16.xhtml_list-layout-threeitems){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_list-layout-threeitems" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1524"><span class="label">Figure 16-10.
</span>Three list items</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The border around the list items shows them to be, essentially, like
block-level elements. Indeed, the value `list-item` is defined to
generate a block box. Now let's add markers, as illustrated in
[Figure 16-11](#ch16.xhtml_list-layout-threeitems-markers){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_list-layout-threeitems-markers" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1611.png" width="600" height="145"
alt="css5 1611" />
<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1525"><span class="label">Figure 16-11.
</span>Markers are added</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The distance between the marker and the list item's content is not
defined by CSS, and CSS does not as yet provide a way to directly affect
that distance.

With the markers outside the list items' content, they don't affect the
layout of other elements, nor do they really even affect the layout of
the list items themselves. They just hang a certain distance from the
edge of the content, and wherever the content edge goes, the marker will
follow. The behavior of the marker works much as though the marker were
absolutely positioned in relation to the list-item content, something
like `position: absolute; left: -1.5em;`. When the marker is inside, it
acts like an inline element at the beginning of the content.

So far, we have yet to add an actual list container; neither a `<ul>`
nor an `<ol>` element is represented in the figures. We can add one to
the mix, as shown in
[Figure 16-12](#ch16.xhtml_list-layout-threeitems-listborder){data-type="xref"}
(it's [represented]{.keep-together} by a dashed border).

<figure class="coderesult width_set_70">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_list-layout-threeitems-listborder" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1612.png" width="600" height="150"

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1526"><span class="label">Figure 16-12.
</span>Adding a list border</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As with the list items, the unordered-list element generates a block
box, one that encompasses its descendant elements. As
[Figure 16-12](#ch16.xhtml_list-layout-threeitems-listborder){data-type="xref"}
illustrates, the markers are placed not only outside the list item
contents, but also outside the content area of the unordered-list
element. The usual "indentation" you expect from lists has not yet been
specified.

Most browsers, as of this writing, []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797024021200
primary="indentation" data-type="indexterm"}indent list items by setting
either padding or margins for the containing list element. For example,
the user agent might apply a rule such as this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul, ol {margin-inline-start: 40px;}
```

Most browsers use a rule that's something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul, ol {padding-inline-start: 40px;}
```

Neither is incorrect, but because browsers can, and have, changed the
way they indent list content, we recommend including values for both
properties when trying to eliminate the indentation of the list items.
[Figure 16-13](#ch16.xhtml_list-layout-padding-v-margin){data-type="xref"}
compares the two approaches.

###### Tip {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1528}

The distance `40px` is a relic of early web browsers, which indented
lists by a pixel amount. (Block quotes are indented by the same
distance.) A good alternate value might be something like `2.5em`, which
would scale the indentation along with changes in the text size and is
also equal to `40px`, assuming a default font size of [16
pixels.]{.keep-together}
:::

For authors who want to change the indentation distance of lists, we
strongly recommend specifying both padding and margins to ensure
cross-browser compatibility. For example, if you want to use padding to
indent a list, use this rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {margin-inline-start: 0; padding-inline-start: 1em;}
```

If you prefer margins, write something like this instead:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ul {margin-inline-start: 1em; padding-inline-start: 0;}
```

In either case, remember that the markers will be placed relative to the
contents of the list items, and may therefore "hang" outside the main
text of a document or even beyond the edge of the browser
window.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797023916144 primary=""
startref="ix_lists_layout" data-type="indexterm"} This is most easily
observed if very large images, or long text strings, are used for the
list markers, as shown in
[Figure 16-14](#ch16.xhtml_list-layout-big-markers){data-type="xref"}.

## The ::marker Pseudo-Element {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1530}

One []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_marker_pseudo primary="::marker pseudo-element"
primary-sortas="marker pseudo-element" data-type="indexterm"}feature
many authors request is the ability to control the space between a
marker and the content of a list item, or to change the size or color of
a list marker independently of the contents of the list items.

List markers can be styled, to a limited extent, with the pseudo-element
`::marker`. The properties allowed for `::marker` rules as of late 2022
are as follows:

-   `content`

-   `color`

-   `text-combine-upright`

-   `unicode-bidi`

-   `direction`

-   `white-space`

-   All the `font-*` properties

-   All the transition and animation properties

You may have noticed that no element-sizing or other box model
properties such as margins are included, which puts a damper on a lot of
authors' desires for marker styling. More properties may be added in the
future, but for now, that's what we have.

A few examples of marker styling, as declared here, are illustrated in
[Figure 16-15](#ch16.xhtml_marker-pseudo-examples){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:nth-child(1)::marker {color: gray;}
li:nth-child(2)::marker {font-size: 2em;}
li:nth-child(3)::marker {font-style: italic;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ol>
	<li>List item the first</li>
	<li>The second list item</li>
	<li>List Items With a Vengeance</li>

Notice that the result of doubling a marker's font size differs between
the ordered and unordered versions of this list. This comes down to the
different default sizing and placement of the two marker types. As
previously noted, the amount of control you have over markers is
limited, even markers defined with `content`. So when you absolutely
must have complete creative freedom with your markers, it's usually
better to build your own with generated content or marked-up inline
content.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797023724128 primary=""

# Creating Generated Content {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1532}

CSS []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_gen_cont_ch16 primary="generated content"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797023720240
primary="generated content" secondary="list markers as"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797023687088
primary="markers, list" secondary="as generated content"
secondary-sortas="generated content" data-type="indexterm"}defines
methods to create *generated content*. This is content inserted via CSS,
but not represented by either markup or content.

For example, list markers are generated content. Nothing in the markup
of a list item directly represents the markers, and you, the author, do
not have to write the markers into your document's content. The browser
simply generates the appropriate marker automatically. For unordered
lists, the marker will have a symbol of some kind, such as a circle,
disc, or square. In ordered lists, the marker is by default a counter
that increments by one for each successive list item. (Or, as you saw in
previous sections, you may replace either kind with an image or
symbol---and, as you'll see in just a bit, anything supported by the
`content` property.)

To understand how you can affect list markers and customize the counting
of ordered lists (or anything else!), you must first look at more basic
generated content.

:::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Inserting Generated Content" data-type="sect2"}
::: {#ch16.xhtml_CHP-12-SECT-2.1 .sect2}
## Inserting Generated Content {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1533}

To insert []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_before_pseudo
primary="::before pseudo-element" primary-sortas="before pseudo-element"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_gen_cont_insert
primary="generated content" secondary="inserting"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_after_pseudo
primary="::after pseudo-element" primary-sortas="after pseudo-element"
data-type="indexterm"}generated content into the document, use the
`::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. These place generated content
before or after the content of an element by way of the `content`
property (described in the next section).

For example, you might want to precede every hyperlink with the text
"(link)" to mark them when the page is printed out. This is accomplished
with a media query and rule like the following, which has the effect
shown in
[Figure 16-16](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-text){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media print{
	a[href]::before {content: "(link)";}
}
```

<figure>

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1534"><span class="label">Figure 16-16.
</span>Generating text content</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note that there isn't a space between the generated content and the
element content. This is because the value of `content` in the previous
example doesn't include a space. You could modify the declaration as
follows to make sure there's a space between generated and actual
content:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href]::before {content: "(link) ";}
```

It's a small difference but an important one.

In a similar manner, you might choose to insert a small icon at the end
of links to PDF documents. The rule to accomplish this would look
something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a.pdf-doc::after {content: url(pdf-doc-icon.gif);}
```

Suppose you want to further style such links by placing a border around
them. This is done with a second rule, shown in
[Figure 16-17](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-icons){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a.pdf-doc {border: 1px solid gray;}
```

    <<generated-content-icons>> shows the result of these two rules.

<figure>
<div id="ch16.xhtml_generated-content-icons" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1617.png" width="600" height="51"

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1535"><span class="label">Figure 16-17.
</span>Generating icons</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the link border extends around the generated content, just
as the link underline extends under the "(link)" text in
[Figure 16-16](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-text){data-type="xref"}.
This happens because by default, generated content is placed inside the
element box of the element (unless the generated content is a list
[marker).]{.keep-together}

You can float or position generated content outside its parent element's
box. All `display` values can be given to generated content; you can
apply block formatting to the generated content of an inline box, and
vice versa. For example, consider this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
em::after {content: " (!) "; display: block;}
```

Even though `em` is an inline element, the generated content will
generate a block box. Similarly, given the following code, the generated
content is made block-level instead of remaining the default of
`inline`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1::before {content: "New Section"; display: block; color: gray;}
```

[Figure 16-18](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-block){data-type="xref"}
shows the result.

<figure class="coderesult width-75">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_generated-content-block" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1536"><span class="label">Figure 16-18.
</span>Generating block-level content</h6>
</div>
</figure>

One interesting aspect of generated content is that it inherits values
from the element to which it's been attached. Thus, given the following
rules, the generated text will be green, the same as the content of the
paragraphs:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {color: green;}
p::before {content: "::: ";}
```

If you want the generated text to be purple instead, a simple
declaration will suffice:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p::before {content: "::: "; color: purple;}
```

Such value inheritance happens only with inherited properties, of
course. This is worth noting because it influences the way certain
effects must be approached. Consider the [following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-top: 3px solid black; padding-top: 0.25em;}
h1::before {content: "New Section"; display: block; color: gray;
  border-bottom: 1px dotted black; margin-bottom: 0.5em;}
```

Since the generated content is placed inside the element box of the
`<h1>`, it will be placed under the top border of the element. It would
also be placed within any padding, as shown in
[Figure 16-19](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-placement){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="width-75 coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_generated-content-placement" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1537"><span class="label">Figure 16-19.
</span>Taking placement into account</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The bottom margin of the generated content, which has been made
block-level, pushes the actual content of the element downward by half
an em. In every sense, the effect of the generated content in this
example is to break the `<h1>` element into two pieces: the
generated-content box and the actual content box. This happens because
the generated content has `display: block`. If you were to change it to
`display: inline` (or remove the `display:block;` entirely), the effect
would be as shown in
[Figure 16-20](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-inline){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {border-top: 3px solid black; padding-top: 0.25em;}
h1::before {content: "New Section"; display: inline; color: gray;
  border-bottom: 1px dotted black; margin-bottom: 0.5em;}
```

</span>Changing the generated content to be inline</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note how the borders are placed and how the top padding is still
honored. So is the bottom margin on the generated content, but since the
generated content is now inline and margins don't affect line height,
the margin has no visible effect.

With the basics of generating content established, let's take a closer
look at the way the actual generated content is
specified.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797023285952 primary=""

You've already seen []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797023223776
primary="string values" data-type="indexterm"}string and URI values in
action, and counters are covered later in this chapter. Let's talk about
strings and URIs in a little more detail before we take a look at the
`attr()` and quote values.

String values are presented literally, even if they contain what would
otherwise be markup of some kind. Therefore, the following rule would be
inserted verbatim into the document, as shown in
[Figure 16-21](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-strings-verbatim){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1541"><span class="label">Figure 16-21.
</span>Strings are displayed verbatim</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This means that if you want a newline (return) as part of your generated
content, you can't use `<br>`. Instead, you use the string `\A`, or
`\00000a`, which is the CSS way of representing a newline (based on the
Unicode line-feed character, which is hexadecimal position `A`).
Conversely, if you have a long string value and need to break it up over
multiple lines, you escape out the line feeds with the `\` character.
These are both demonstrated by the following rule and illustrated in
[Figure 16-22](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-strings-newlines){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2::before {content: "We insert this text before all H2 elements because \
it is a good idea to show how these things work. It may be a bit long \
but the point should be clearly made.  "; color: gray;}

You can also use escapes to refer to hexadecimal Unicode values, such as

::: {#ch16.xhtml_CHP-12-NOTE-101 .warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1543}

As of this writing, while inserting escaped content such as `\279c` is
very well-supported, some browsers don't support the escaped newline
character `\A` or `\0000a`, and no browsers support `\A` unless you add
a space after it.

With []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797023155120
primary="URI values, generated content" data-type="indexterm"}URI
values, you point to an external resource (an image, movie, sound clip,
or anything else the user agent supports), which is then inserted into
the document in the appropriate place. If the user agent can't support
the resource you point it to for any reason---say, you try to insert a
movie into a document when it's being printed---then the user agent is
required to ignore the resource completely, and nothing will be
inserted.

### Inserting attribute values {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1544}

Sometimes you []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_attr_gen_cont primary="attributes"
secondary="generated content inserted"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_gen_cont_attr
primary="generated content" secondary="attribute values (attr())"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_attr_exp
primary="attr() expression" data-type="indexterm"}might want to take the
value of an element's attribute and make it a part of the document
display. To pick a simple example, you can place the value of every
link's `href` attribute immediately after the links, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href]::after {content: attr(href);}
```

Again, this leads to the problem of the generated content running smack
into the actual content. To solve this, add some string values to the
declaration, with the result shown in
[Figure 16-23](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-strings-attr-urls){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
a[href]::after {content: " [" attr(href) "]";}
```

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1545"><span class="label">Figure 16-23.
</span>Inserting URLs</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This can be useful for print stylesheets, as an example. Any attribute
value can be inserted as generated content: `alt` text, `class` or `id`
values---anything. An author might choose to make the citation
information explicit for a block quote, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
blockquote::after {content: "(" attr(cite) ")"; display: block;
  text-align: right; font-style: italic;}
```

For that matter, a more complicated rule might reveal the text- and
link-color values for a legacy document:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body::before {
  content: "Text: " attr(text) " | Link: " attr(link)
  " | Visited: " attr(vlink) " | Active: " attr(alink);
  display: block; padding: 0.33em;
  border: 1px solid; text-align: center; color: red;}
```

Note that if an attribute doesn't exist, an empty string is put in its
place. This is what happens in
[Figure 16-24](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-attr-missing){data-type="xref"},
in which the previous example is applied to a document whose `body`
element has no `alink` attribute.

</span>Missing attributes are skipped</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The text "Active: " (including the trailing space) is inserted into the
document, as you can see, but nothing follows it. This is convenient
when you want to insert the value of an attribute only when it exists.

Other than the keywords `none` and `inherit`, the only valid value is
one or more *pairs* of strings, with the first in each pair being a
value for `open-quote` and the second being a `close-quote` value. The
first string of the pair defines the open-quote symbol, and the second
defines the close-quote symbol. Therefore, of the following two
declarations, only the first is valid:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
quotes: '"' "'";  /* valid */
quotes: '"';  /* NOT VALID */
```

The first rule also illustrates one way to put string quotes around the
strings themselves. The double quotation marks are surrounded by single
quotation marks, and vice versa.

Let's look at a simple example. Suppose you're creating an XML format to
store a list of favorite quotations. Here's one entry in the list:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<quotation>
  <quote>I hate quotations.</quote>
  <quotee>Ralph Waldo Emerson</quotee>
</quotation>
```

To present the data in a useful way, you could employ the following
rules, with the result shown in
[Figure 16-25](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-quotes){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
quotation {display: block;}
quote {quotes: '“' '”';}
quote::before {content: open-quote;}
quote::after {content: close-quote;}
quotee::before {content: " (";}
quotee::after {content: ")";}
```

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1550"><span class="label">Figure 16-25.
</span>Inserting quotes and other content</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The values `open-quote` and `close-quote` are used to insert whatever
quoting symbols are appropriate (since different languages have
different quotation marks). They use the value of quotes to determine
how they should work. Thus, the quotation begins and ends with a double
quotation mark.

With `quotes`, you can define quotation patterns to as many nesting
levels as you like. In American English, for example, a common practice
is to start out with a double quotation mark and then use single
quotation marks for the quotation nested inside the first one. This can
be re-created with *curly* quotation marks by using the following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
quotation: display: block;}
quote {quotes: '\201C' '\201D' '\2018' '\2019';}
quote::before, q::before{content: open-quote;}
quote::after, q::after {content: close-quote;}
```

When applied to the following XML, these rules will have the effect
shown in
[Figure 16-26](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-quotes-nested){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<quotation>
 <quote> In the beginning, there was nothing. And God said: <q>Let there
  be light!</q> And there was still nothing, but you could see it.</quote>
</quotation>
```

</span>Nested curly quotes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If the nested level of quotation marks is greater than the number of
defined pairs, the last pair is reused for the deeper levels. Thus, if
we had applied the following rule to the markup shown in
[Figure 16-26](#ch16.xhtml_generated-content-quotes-nested){data-type="xref"},
the inner quote would have had double quotation marks, the same as the
outer quote:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
quote {quotes: '\201C' '\201D';}
```

::: {data-type="tip"}
###### Tip {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1552}

These particular rules use the hexadecimal Unicode positions for the
curly quote symbols. If your CSS uses UTF-8 character encoding (and it
really should), you can skip the escaped hexadecimal position approach
and include just the curly quote characters directly, as in previous
examples.
:::

Generated quotes make possible one other common typographic effect. When
quoted text spans several paragraphs, the `close-quote` of each
paragraph is often omitted; only the opening quote marks are shown, with
the exception of the last paragraph. This can be re-created using the
`no-close-quote` value:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
blockquote {quotes: '"' '"' "'" "'" '"' '"';}
blockquote p::before {content: open-quote;}
blockquote p::after {content: no-close-quote;}
blockquote p:last-of-type::after {content: close-quote;}
```

This will start each paragraph with a double quotation mark but no
closing mark. This is true of the last paragraph as well, so the fourth
line in the previous code block inserts a close quote at the end of the
last paragraph.

This value is important because it decrements the quotation nesting
level without generating a symbol. This is why each paragraph starts
with a double quotation mark, instead of alternating between double and
single marks, until the third paragraph is reached. The `no-close-quote`
value closes the quotation nesting at the end of each paragraph, and
thus every paragraph starts at the same nesting level.

This is significant because, as the []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797022477360

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797022476448
primary="CSS2 specification" secondary="quotes"
data-type="indexterm"}CSS2.1 specification notes, "Quoting depth is
independent of the nesting of the source document or the formatting
structure." In other words, when you start a quotation level, it
persists across elements until a `close-quote` is encountered, and the
quote nesting level is decremented.

For the sake of completeness, there is a `no-open-quote` keyword, which
has a symmetrical effect to `no-close-quote`. This keyword increments
the quotation nesting level by one but does not generate a
symbol.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797022472912 primary=""

A *counter identifier* is []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797022405616
primary="counter identifier" data-type="indexterm"}simply a label
created by the author. For example, you might name your subsection
counter `subsection`, `subsec`, `ss`, or `bob`. The simple act of
resetting (or incrementing) an identifier is sufficient to call it into
being. In the following rule, the counter `chapter` is defined as it is
reset:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {counter-reset: chapter;}
```

By default, a counter is reset to 0. If you want to reset to a different
number, you can declare that number following the identifier:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1#ch4 {counter-reset: chapter 4;}
```

You can also reset multiple identifiers all at once by listing
space-separated identifier-integer pairs. If you leave out an integer,
it defaults to 0:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {counter-reset: chapter 4 section -1 subsec figure 1;}
   /* 'subsec' is reset to 0 */
```

As you can see from the previous example, negative values are permitted.
It would be perfectly legal to set a counter to `-32768` and count up
from there.

Like `counter-reset`, `counter-increment` accepts identifier-integer
pairs, and the integer portion of these pairs can be 0 or negative as
well as positive. The difference is that if an integer is omitted from a
pair in `counter-increment`, it defaults to 1, not 0.

As an example, here's how a user agent might define counters to
re-create the traditional 1, 2, 3 counting of ordered lists:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol {counter-reset: ordered;}  /* defaults to 0 */
ol li {counter-increment: ordered;}  /* defaults to 1 */
```

On the other hand, an author might want to count backward from 0 so that
the list items use a rising negative system. This would require only a
small edit:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol {counter-reset: ordered;}  /* defaults to 0 */
ol li {counter-increment: ordered -1;}
```

The counting of lists would then be --1, --2, --3, and so on. If you
replaced the integer `-1` with `-2`, lists would count --2, --4, --6,
and so on.

primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="displaying"
data-type="indexterm"}display the counters, you need to use the
`content` property in conjunction with one of the counter-related
values. To see how this works, let's use an XML-based ordered list:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<list type="ordered">
 <item>First item</item>
 <item>Item two</item>
 <item>The third item</item>
</list>
```

By applying the following rules to XML employing this structure, you
would get the result shown in
[Figure 16-27](#ch16.xhtml_counters-counting-items){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
list[type="ordered"] {counter-reset: ordered;}  /* defaults to 0 */
list[type="ordered"] item {display: block;}
list[type="ordered"] item::before {counter-increment: ordered;
     content: counter(ordered) ". "; margin: 0.25em 0;}
```

</span>Counting the items</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The generated content is placed as inline content at the beginning of
the associated element. Thus, the effect is similar to an HTML list with
`list-style-position: inside;` declared.

The `<item>` elements are ordinary elements generating block-level
boxes, which means that counters are not restricted only to elements
with a `display` of `list-item`. In fact, any element can use a counter.
Consider the following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {counter-reset: section subsec;
    counter-increment: chapter;}
h1::before {content: counter(chapter) ". ";}
h2 {counter-reset: subsec;
    counter-increment: section;}
h2::before {content: counter(chapter )"." counter(section) ". ";}
h3 {counter-increment: subsec;}
h3::before {content: counter(chapter) "." counter(section) "."
        counter(subsec) ". ";}
```

These rules would have the effect shown in
[Figure 16-28](#ch16.xhtml_counters-counting-headings){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_counters-counting-headings" class="figure">

</span>Adding counters to headings</h6>
</div>
</figure>

[Figure 16-28](#ch16.xhtml_counters-counting-headings){data-type="xref"}
illustrates some important points about counter resetting and
incrementing. For instance, notice that the counters are reset on the
elements, whereas the actual generated-content counters are inserted via
the `::before` pseudo-elements. Attempting to reset counters in the
pseudo-elements won't work: you'll get a lot of zeros.

Also notice that the `<h1>` element uses the counter `chapter`, which
defaults to 0 and has a "1." before the element's text. When a counter
is incremented and used by the same element, the incrementation happens
*before* the counter is displayed. Similarly, if a counter is reset and
shown in the same element, the reset happens before the counter is
displayed. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1::before, h2::before, h3::before {
  content: counter(chapter) "." counter(section) "." counter(subsec) ". ";}
h1 {counter-reset: section subsec;
  counter-increment: chapter;}
```

The first `<h1>` element in the document would be preceded by the text
"1.0.0." because the counters `section` and `subsec` were reset but not
incremented. Thus, if you want the first displayed instance of an
incremented counter to be 0, you need to reset that counter to `-1`, as
follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {counter-reset: chapter -1;}
h1::before {counter-increment: chapter; content: counter(chapter) ". ";}
```

You can do some interesting things with counters. Consider the following
XML:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<code type="BASIC">
  <line>PRINT "Hello world!"</line>
  <line>REM This is what the kids are calling a "comment"</line>
  <line>GOTO 10</line>
</code>
```

You can re-create the traditional format of a BASIC program listing with
the following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
code[type="BASIC"] {counter-reset: linenum; font-family: monospace;}
code[type="BASIC"] line {display: block;}
code[type="BASIC"] line::before {counter-increment: linenum 10;
  content: counter(linenum) ": ";}
```

It's also possible to define a list style for each counter as part of
the `counter()` format. You can do this by adding a comma-separated
`list-style-type` keyword after the counter's identifier. The following
modification of the heading-counter example is illustrated in
[Figure 16-29](#ch16.xhtml_counters-counting-headings-changed){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {counter-reset: section subsec;
    counter-increment: chapter;}
h1::before {content: counter(chapter,upper-alpha) ". ";}
h2 {counter-reset: subsec;
    counter-increment: section;}
h2::before {content: counter(chapter,upper-alpha)"." counter(section) ". ";}
h3 {counter-increment: subsec;}
h3::before {content: counter(chapter,upper-alpha) "." counter(section) "."
        counter(subsec,lower-roman) ". ";}
```

Notice that the counter `section` is not given a style keyword, so it
defaults to the decimal counting style. You can even set counters to use
the styles `disc`, `circle`, `square`, and `none` if you so desire,
though every instance of those counters will be just a single copy of
the symbol you specified.

One interesting point to note is that elements with a `display` of
`none` do not increment counters, even if the rule seems to indicate
otherwise. In contrast, elements with a [`visibility`]{.keep-together}
of `hidden` *do* increment counters:[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797021644480

### Counters and scope {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1562}

So far, you've []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_lists_counter_scope primary="lists"
secondary="counters" tertiary="scope of"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_counter_scope
primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="scope of"
data-type="indexterm"}seen how to string multiple counters together to
create section-and-subsection counting. Often, this is something authors
desire for nested ordered lists as well, but trying to create enough
counters to cover deep nesting levels would quickly become clumsy. Just
to get counters to work for five-level-deep nested lists would require a
bunch of rules like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol ol ol ol ol li::before {
    counter-increment: ord1 ord2 ord3 ord4 ord5;
    content: counter(ord1) "." counter(ord2) "." counter(ord3) "."
        counter(ord4) "." counter(ord5) ".";}
```

Imagine writing enough rules to cover nesting up to 50 levels! (We're
not saying you should nest ordered lists 50 deep. Just follow along for
the moment.)

Fortunately, CSS 2.1 described the concept of *scope* when it comes to
counters. Stated simply, every level of nesting creates a new scope for
any given counter. Scope is what makes it possible for the following
rules to cover nested-list counting in the usual HTML way:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol {counter-reset: ordered;}
ol li::before {counter-increment: ordered; content: counter(ordered) ". ";}
```

These rules will all make ordered lists, even those nested inside
others, start counting from 1 and increment each item by one---exactly
the way it's been done in HTML from the beginning.

This works because a new instance of the counter `ordered` is created at
each level of nesting. So, for the first ordered list, an instance of
`ordered` is created. Then, for every list nested inside the first one,
another new instance is created, and the counting starts anew with each
list.

However, suppose you want ordered lists to count so that each level of
nesting creates a new counter appended to the old: 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1,
1.2.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1, and so on. This can't be done with `counter()`, but
it *can* be done with `counters()`. What a difference an *s* makes.

To create the nested-counter style shown in
[Figure 16-30](#ch16.xhtml_counters-scope-nested){data-type="xref"}, you
need these rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol {counter-reset: ordered; list-style: none;}
ol li:before {content: counters(ordered,".") ": "; counter-increment: ordered;}
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_counters-scope-nested" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1630.png" width="600" height="519"

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1563"><span class="label">Figure 16-30.
</span>Nested counters</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Basically, the keyword `counters(ordered,".")` displays the `ordered`
counter from each scope with a period appended, and strings together all
of the scoped counters for a given element. Thus, an item in a
third-level nested list would be prefaced with the `ordered` value for
the outermost list's scope, the scope of the list between the outer and
current list, and the current list's scope, with each of those followed
by a period. The rest of the [`content`]{.keep-together} value causes a
space, colon, and space to be added after all of those counters.

As with `counter()`, you can define a list style for nested counters,
but the same style applies to all of the counters. Thus, if you changed
your previous CSS to read as follows, the list items in
[Figure 16-30](#ch16.xhtml_counters-scope-nested){data-type="xref"}
would all use lowercase letters for the counters instead of numbers:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
ol li::before {counter-increment: ordered;
    content: counters(ordered,".",lower-alpha) ": ";}
```

You may have noticed that `list-style: none` was applied to the `<ol>`
elements in the previous examples. That's because the counters being
inserted were generated content, not replacement list markers. In other
words, had the `list-style: none` been omitted, each list item would
have had its user agent-supplied list counter, *plus* the
generated-content counters we defined.

That ability can be very useful, but sometimes you really just want to

beyond simple nested counting, perhaps into defining base-60 counting or
using patterns of symbols, CSS provides a way to define almost any
counting pattern you can imagine. You can use `@counter-style` blocks,
with dedicated descriptors to manage the outcome. The general pattern is
as follows:

``` {code-language="python"}
@counter-style <name> {
    …declarations…
}
```

Here, `<`*`name`*`>` is an author-supplied name for the pattern in
question. For example, to create a series of alternating triangle
markers, the block might look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style triangles {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols: ▶ ▷;
}
ol {list-style: triangles;}
```

[Figure 16-31](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-triangles){data-type="xref"}
shows the result.

For pretty much any `@counter-style` block, those are the minimum two
descriptors. You can leave out `system` if you're defining a `symbolic`
system, but it's generally better to include it so that you're clear
about the kind of system you're setting up. Remember, the next person to
work on the styles may not be as familiar with counter styling as you!

## Fixed Counting Patterns {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1569}

The []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_fixed_patt_ctr_style
primary="fixed pattern, @counter-style"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_count_fixed
primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="fixed"
data-type="indexterm"}simplest kind of counter pattern is a `fixed`
system. Fixed systems are used when you want to define an exact sequence
of counter markers that doesn't repeat after you've run out of markers.
Consider this example, which has the result shown in
[Figure 16-32](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-fixed){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style emoji {
    system: fixed;
    symbols:     ;
}
ol.emoji {list-style: emoji;}
```

<figure class="coderesult width_set_70">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-fixed" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1632.png" width="194" height="387"
alt="css5 1632" />
<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1570"><span class="label">Figure 16-32.
</span>A fixed counter pattern</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Once the list gets past the fifth list item, the counter system runs out
of emoji, and since no fallback was defined (we'll get to that shortly),
the markers for subsequent list items fall back to the default for
ordered lists.

Notice that the symbols in the `symbols` descriptor are separated by
spaces. If they were all jammed together with no space separation, you'd
get a result like that in
[Figure 16-33](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-fixed-tooclose){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-fixed-tooclose" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1633.png" width="446" height="387"
alt="css5 1633" />
<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1571"><span class="label">Figure 16-33.
</span>When symbols get too close</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This does mean you can define a fixed sequence of markers in which each
marker is composed of multiple symbols. (If you want to define a set of
symbols that are combined in patterns to create a counting system, just
wait: we're getting to that soon.)

If you want to use ASCII symbols in your markers, it's generally
advisable to quote them. This avoids problems like angle brackets being
mistaken for pieces of HTML by the parser. Thus you might do something
like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style emoji {
    system: fixed;
    symbols: # $ % ">";
}
```

It's acceptable to quote all symbols, and it might be a good idea to get
into that habit. That means more typing---the preceding value would
become `"#" "$" "%" ">"`---but it's less error-prone.

In fixed counter systems, you can define a starting value in the
`system` descriptor itself. If you want to start the counting at 5, for
example, you'd write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style emoji {
    system: fixed 5;
    symbols:     ;
}
ul.emoji {list-style: emoji;}
```

In this case, the first five symbols represent counters 5 through 9.

primary="cyclic pattern, @counter-style"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_counter_cyclic
primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="cyclic"
data-type="indexterm"}step beyond fixed patterns is `cyclic` patterns,
which are fixed patterns that repeat. Let's take the fixed emoji pattern
from the previous section and convert it to cyclic. This will have the
result shown in
[Figure 16-34](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-cyclic){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style emojiverse {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols:     ;
}

ul.emoji {list-style: emojiverse;}

</span>A cyclic counter pattern</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The defined symbols are used in order, over and over, until no more
items remain left [to count.]{.keep-together}

It's possible to use `cyclic` to supply a single marker that's used for
the entire pattern, much like supplying a string for `list-style-type`.
In this case, it would look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style thinker {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols: ;
    /* equivalent to list-style-type: ; */
}

ul.hmmm {list-style: thinker;}
```

primary="suffix descriptor, @counter-style"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_prefix_desc
primary="prefix descriptor, @counter-style" data-type="indexterm"}thing
you may have noticed is that so far, all our counters have been followed
by a full stop (or a period, if you prefer). This is due to the default
value of the `suffix` descriptor, which has a cousin descriptor,
`prefix`.

  **Value**           \<*`symbol`*\>
  **Initial value**   `""` (empty string) for `prefix`; `\2E` (the full stop, or period, `"`.`"`) for `suffix`
  **Notes**           A \<*`symbol`*\> can be any Unicode-compliant string, an image reference, or an identifier such as an escaped hexadecimal reference
  ------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{=html}
</aside>
```
With these descriptors, you can define symbols that are inserted before
and after every marker in the pattern. Thus, we might give our thinker
ASCII wings like so, as illustrated in
[Figure 16-35](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-cyclic-wings){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style wingthinker {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols: ;
    prefix: "~";
    suffix: " ~";
}

ul.hmmm {list-style: wingthinker;}
```

<figure class="coderesult">

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1576"><span class="label">Figure 16-35.
</span>Putting “wings” on the thinker</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The `suffix` descriptor is particularly useful if you want to remove the
default suffix from your markers. Here's one example of how to do so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style thisisfine {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols:   ;
    suffix: "";
}
```

You can also extend the markers in creative ways by using `prefix` and
`suffix`, as shown in
[Figure 16-36](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-cyclic-thisisfine){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style thisisfine {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols:   ;
    prefix: "";
    suffix: "";
}
```

<figure class="coderesult">
<div id="ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-cyclic-thisisfine" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1636.png" width="390" height="755"
alt="css5 1636" />
<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1577"><span class="label">Figure 16-36.
</span>This list is fine</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You might wonder why the `prefix` value is quoted in this example, while
the `suffix` value is not. There is no reason other than to demonstrate
that both approaches work. As stated before, quoting symbols is safer
but is rarely required.

You may also see some differences between the Unicode glyphs in the CSS
examples here and those shown in the figures. This is an unavoidable
aspect of using emoji and other such characters---what appears on one
person's user agent may be different on someone else's. Consider the
differences in emoji rendering between macOS, iOS, Android, Samsung,
Windows desktop, Windows mobile, Linux, and so on.

You can use images for your counters, at least in theory. As an example,
suppose you want to use a series of Klingon glyphs, which have no
Unicode equivalents. (It's a long-standing industry myth that Klingon is
in Unicode. It was proposed in 1997 and rejected in 2001. A new proposal
was made in 2016 and was once again rejected.) We won't represent the
entire set of symbols here, but it would start something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style klingon-letters {
    system: cyclic;
    symbols: url(i/klingon-a.svg) url(i/klingon-b.svg)
        url(i/klingon-ch.svg) url(i/klingon-d.svg)
        url(i/klingon-e.svg) url(i/klingon-gh.svg);
    suffix: url(i/klingon-full-stop.svg);
}
```

This would cycle from *A* through *GH* and then repeat, but still, you'd
get some Klingon symbology, which might be enough. We'll see ways to
build up alphabetic and numeric systems later in the
chapter.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797020543376 primary=""

primary="symbolic pattern, @counter-style"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_counter_symb
primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="symbolic"
data-type="indexterm"}system is similar to a cyclic system, except in
symbolic systems, for each restart of the symbol sequence, the number of
symbols increases by one. Each marker is made up of a single symbol that
is repeated the number of times the symbol sequence has repeated. This
may be familiar to you from footnote symbols, or some varieties of
alphabetic systems. Examples of each are shown here, with the result in
[Figure 16-37](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-symbolic){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style footnotes {
    system: symbolic;
    symbols: "*" "†" "§";

</span>Two patterns of symbolic counting</h6>

One thing to watch out for is that if you have only a few symbols
applied to a very long list, the markers will quickly get quite long.
Consider the letter counters shown in the previous example.
[Figure 16-38](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-symbolic-long){data-type="xref"}
shows what the 135th through 150th entries in a list using that system
would look like.

</span>Very long symbolic markers</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This sort of consideration will become more of an issue from here on
out, because the counter styles are all additive in one sense or
another. To limit your exposure to these kinds of problems, you can use
the `range` descriptor.

```{=html}
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar">
```
::: {#ch16.xhtml_idm45797020462560 .sidebar}
# range descriptor {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1582}

  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  **Values**          \[ \[ \<*`integer`*\> \| `infinite` \]{2} \]# \| `auto`
  **Initial value**   `auto`
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
With `range`, you can supply one or more space-separated pairs of
values, with each pair separated from the others by commas. Let's
suppose we want to stop the letter-doubling after three iterations. We
have five symbols, so we can restrict their use to the first 15 list
items like so, with the result shown in
[Figure 16-39](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-symbolic-ranged){data-type="xref"}
(which has been arranged in two columns to keep the figure size
reasonable):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style letters {
    system: symbolic;
    symbols: A B C D E;
    range: 1 15;
}
```

</span>Using <code>range</code> to limit a symbolic counter pattern</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If we needed, for whatever reason, to supply a second range of counter
usage, it would look like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style letters {
    system: symbolic;
    symbols: A B C D E;
    range: 1 15, 101 115;
}
```

The symbolic letter system defined by `letters` would be applied in the
range 1--15 as well as 101--115 (which would be "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
through "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE," rather
appropriately).[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797020321088 primary=""

happens to the counters that fall outside of the range(s) defined by
`range`? They fall back to a default marker style. You can leave that up

of the `fallback` descriptor.

primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="alphabetic"
data-type="indexterm"}system is similar to a `symbolic` system, except
the manner of repeating changes. Remember, with symbolic counting, the
number of symbols goes up with each iteration through the cycle. In
alphabetic systems, each symbol is treated as a digit in a numbering
system. If you've spent any time in spreadsheets, this counting method
may be familiar to you from the column labels.

To illustrate this, let's reuse the letter symbols from the previous
section, and change from a symbolic to an alphabetic system. The result
is shown in
[Figure 16-40](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-alphabetic){data-type="xref"}
(once again [formatted]{.keep-together} as two columns to fit):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style letters {
    system: alphabetic;
    symbols: A B C D E;
    /* once more cut off at 'E' to show the pattern’s effects more quickly */
}
```

</span>Alphabetic counting</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice the second iteration of the pattern, which runs from "AA" to "AE"
before switching over to "BA" through "BE," then on to "CA" and so on.
In the symbolic version of this, we'd already be up to "EEEEEE" by the
time "EE" was reached in the alphabetic system.

Note that to be valid, an alphabetic system must have a minimum of *two*
symbols supplied in the `symbols` descriptor. If only one symbol is
supplied, the entire `@counter-style` block is rendered invalid. Any two
symbols are valid; they can be letters, numbers, or really anything in
Unicode, as well as images (again, in theory).

## Numeric Counting Patterns {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1587}

When you []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_num_ctr_style
primary="numeric pattern, @counter-style"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797020195120
primary="positional numbering"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_ix_counter_num
primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="numeric"
data-type="indexterm"}define a `numeric` system, you're technically
using the symbols you supply to define a *positional numbering*
system---that is, the symbols are used as digits in a place-number
counting system. Defining ordinary decimal counting, for example, would
be done like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style decimal {
    system: numeric;
    symbols: '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9';
}
```

This base is extensible to create hexadecimal counting, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style hexadecimal {
    system: numeric;
    symbols: '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9' 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' 'F';
}
```

That counter style will count from 1 through F, roll over to 10 and
count up to 1F, then 20 to 2F, 30 to 3F, etc. Much more simply, it's a
breeze to set up binary counting:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style binary {
    system: numeric;
    symbols: '0' '1';
}
```

Examples of these three counting patterns are shown in
[Figure 16-41](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-numeric-three-systems){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="bordernone">

</span>Three numeric counting patterns</h6>
</div>
</figure>

An interesting question to consider is: what happens if a counter value
is negative? In decimal counting, we generally expect negative numbers
to be preceded by a minus sign (`–`), but what about in other systems,
like symbolic? What if we define a letter-based numeric counting system?
[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797020050304
primary="negative descriptor, @counter-style" data-type="indexterm"}Or
if we want to use accounting-style formatting, which puts negative
values into parentheses? This is where the `negative` descriptor comes
into play.

```{=html}
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar">

::: {#ch16.xhtml_idm45797020048864 .sidebar}
# negative descriptor {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1589}

  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Values**          \<*`symbol`*\> \<*`symbol`*\>?
  **Initial value**   `\2D` (the hyphen-minus symbol)
  **Notes**           `negative` is applicable only in counting systems that allow negative values: `alphabetic`, `numeric`, `symbolic`, and `additive`.
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
The `negative` descriptor is like its own little self-contained
combination of `prefix` and `suffix` that is applied only when the
counter has a negative value. Its symbols are placed to the inside (that
is, closer to the counter) of any prefix and suffix symbols.

So let's say we want to use accounting-style formatting, and to add
prefix and suffix symbols to all counters. That would be done as
follows, with the result shown in
[Figure 16-42](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-numeric-negative){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

}

Another []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_pad_desc
primary="pad descriptor, @counter-style" data-type="indexterm"}common
feature of numeric counting systems is the desire to pad out low values
so that their length matches that of higher values. For example, rather
than 1 and 100, a counting pattern might use leading zeros to create 001
and 100. This can be accomplished with the `pad` descriptor.

```{=html}
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar">
```
::: {#ch16.xhtml_idm45797019967504 .sidebar}

  ------------------- -----------------------------------

  **Initial value**   `0 ""`
  ------------------- -----------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
The pattern of this descriptor is interesting. The first part is an
integer that defines the number of digits that every counter should
have. The second part is a string that's used to fill out any value
containing fewer than the defined number of digits. Consider [this
example:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style padded {
    system: numeric;
    symbols: '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9';
    suffix: '.';
    pad: 4 "0";
}

ol {list-style: decimal;}
ol.padded {list-style: padded;}
```

Given these styles, ordered lists will all used decimal counting by
default: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Those with a `class` of `padded` will use
padded decimal counting: 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0005...
[Figure 16-43](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-numeric-pad){data-type="xref"}
shows an example.

<figure>
<div id="ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-numeric-pad" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1643.png" width="217" height="552"
alt="css5 1643" />
<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1592"><span class="label">Figure 16-43.
</span>Padding values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Note that the padded counters use the `0` symbol to fill in any missing
leading digits, in order to make every counter be at least four digits
long. The "at least" part of that sentence is important: if a counter
gets up to five digits, it won't be padded. More importantly, if a
counter reaches five digits, none of the other shorter counters will get
additional zeros. They'll stay four digits long, because of the `4` in
`4 "0"`.

Any symbol can be used to pad values, not just `0`. You could use
underlines, periods, emoji, arrow symbols, empty spaces, or anything
else you like. In fact, you can have multiple characters in the
\<*`symbol`*\> part of the value. The following is perfectly acceptable,
if not necessarily desirable:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style crazy {
    system: numeric;
    symbols: '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9';
    suffix: '.';
    pad: 7 " ";
}

ol {list-style: decimal;}
ol.padded {list-style: padded;}
```

Given a counter value of `1`, the result of that crazy counting system
would be "![thinking face emoji](./images/thinking.png){.emoji
emoji-embed="thinking face" height="45" width="42"}![winking face
emoji](./images/winking.png){.emoji emoji-embed="winking face"

emoji](./images/winking.png){.emoji emoji-embed="winking face"
height="43" width="44"}1."

Note that negative symbols count toward symbol length and thus eat into
padding. Also note that the negative sign will come *outside* any
padding. Given the following styles, we'd get the result shown in
[Figure 16-44](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-numeric-negativepad){data-type="xref"}:[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797019745072

`additive-symbol` counting. In additive counting systems, different

properly and then adding up the numbers that each represents yields the
counter value.

```{=html}

```
It's much easier to show this than explain it. Here's an example adapted
from [Kseso](https://escss.blogspot.com):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style roman {
    system: additive;
    additive-symbols:
        1000 M, 900 CM, 500 D, 400 CD,
        100 C, 90 XC, 50 L, 40 XL,
        10 X, 9 IX, 5 V, 4 IV, 1 I;
}
```

This will count in classical Roman style. Another good example can be
found in the specification for counting styles, which defines a
dice-counting system:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style dice {
    system: additive;
    additive-symbols: 6 ⚅, 5 ⚄, 4 ⚃, 3 ⚂, 2 ⚁, 1 ⚀, 0 "__";
    suffix: " ";
}
```

The results of both counting systems are shown in
[Figure 16-45](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-additive-romandice){data-type="xref"};
this time, each list has been formatted as three columns.

<figure>
<div id="ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-additive-romandice" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1645.png" width="600" height="147"

<h6 id="ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1596"><span class="label">Figure 16-45.
</span>Additive values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Symbols can be quoted for clarity; e.g., `6 "⚅", 5 "⚄", 4 "⚃"`, and so
on.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that the order of the
symbols and their equivalent values matters. Notice that both the Roman
and dice-counting systems supply values from largest to smallest, not
the other way around? That's because if you put the values in any order
other than descending, the entire block is rendered invalid.

Also notice the use of the `additive-symbols` descriptor instead of
`symbols`. This is important to keep in mind, since defining an additive
system and then trying to use the `symbols` descriptor will render the
entire `counter-styles` block invalid. (Similarly, attempting to use the
`additive-symbols` description in non-`additive` systems will render
*those* blocks invalid.)

One last thing to note about additive systems is that, because of the
way the additive-counter algorithm is defined, it's possible to create
additive systems in which some values can't be represented even though
it seems like they should be. Consider this definition:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style problem {
    system: additive;
    additive-symbols: 3 "Y", 2 "X";
    fallback: decimal;
}
```

This would yield the following counters for the first five numbers: 1,
X, Y, 4, YX. You might think 4 should be XX, and that may make intuitive
sense, but the algorithm for additive symbols doesn't permit it. To
quote the specification: "While unfortunate, this is required to
maintain the property that the algorithm runs in linear time relative to
the size of the counter value."[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797019393952
primary="" startref="ix_add_sym_desc"

So how does []{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797019391216
primary="Roman numeral counting, generated" data-type="indexterm"}Roman
counting manage to get III for 3? Again, the answer is in the algorithm.
It's a little too complicated to get into here, so if you're truly
curious, we recommend you read the CSS Counter Styles Level 3
specification, which defines the additive counting algorithm. If that
doesn't interest you, just remember: make sure you have a symbol whose
value equates to `1`, and you'll avoid this problem.

## Extending Counting Patterns {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1598}

There []{#ch16.xhtml_ix_counter_extend
primary="counters and counting patterns" secondary="extending"
data-type="indexterm"}may come a time when you just want to vary an
existing counting system a bit. For example, suppose you want to change
regular decimal counting to use close-parentheses symbols as suffixes,
and pad up to two leading zeros. You could write it all out longhand,
like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style mydecimals {
    system: numeric;
    symbols: '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9';
    suffix: ") ";
    pad: 2 "0";
}
```

That works, but it's clumsy. Well, worry not: `extends` is here to help.

The `extends` option is sort of a system type, but only in the sense
that it builds on an existing system type. The previous example would be
rewritten with `extends` as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style mydecimals {
    system: extends decimal;
    suffix: ") ";
    pad: 2 "0";
}
```

That takes the existing `decimal` system familiar from `list-style-type`
and reformats it a bit. Thus, there's no need to retype the whole symbol
chain. You just adjust the options, as it were.

In fact, you can *only* adjust the options: if you try to use either
`symbols` or `additive-symbols` in an `extends` system, the entire
`@counter-style` block will be invalid and ignored. In other words,
symbols cannot be extended. As an example, you can't define hexadecimal
counting by extending decimal counting.

However, you can vary the hexadecimal counting for different contexts.
As an example, you could set up basic hex counting and then define
variant display patterns, as shown in the following code and illustrated
in
[Figure 16-46](#ch16.xhtml_counter-patterns-extends-fourhex){data-type="xref"}.

###### Warning {#ch16.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1603}

As of late 2022, `speak-as` is supported only by Mozilla-based browsers.
:::

Let's take the values backward. With a \<*`counter-style-name`*\>,
you're able to define an alternate counting style that the user agent
likely already recognizes. For example, you likely want to provide an
audio fallback for dice counting to be `decimal`, one of the
well-supported `list-style-type` values, when spoken:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@counter-style dice {
    system: additive;
    speak-as: decimal;
    additive-symbols: 6 ⚅, 5 ⚄, 4 ⚃, 3 ⚂, 2 ⚁, 1 ⚀;
    suffix: " ";
}
```

Given those styles, the counter ⚅⚅⚂ would be spoken as "fifteen."
Alternatively, if the `speak-as` value is changed to `lower-latin`, that
counter will be spoken as "oh" (capital letter *O*).

The `spell-out` value might seem fairly straightforward but it's a
little more complicated than it first appears. What is spelled out by
the user agent is a "counter representation," which is then spelled out
letter by letter. It's hard to predict what that will mean, since the
method of generating a counter representation isn't precisely defined:
the specification says, "Counter representations are constructed by
concatenating counter symbols together." And that's all.

The `words` value is similar to `spell-out`, except the counter
representation is spoken as words instead of spelling out each letter.
Again, the exact process is not defined.

With the value `numbers`, the counters are spoken as numbers in the
document language. This is similar to the previous code sample, where
⚅⚅⚂ is spoken as "fifteen," at least in English documents. If it's
another language, that language is used for counting: "quince" in
Spanish, "fünfzehn" in German, "shíwǔ" in Chinese, and so on.

Given `bullets`, the user agent says whatever it says when reading a
bullet (marker) in an unordered list. This may mean saying nothing at
all, or producing an audio cue such as a chime or click.

Finally, consider the default value of `auto`. We saved this for last
because its effect depends on the counting system in use. If it's an
`alphabetic` system, `speak-as: auto` has the same effect as
`speak-as: spell-out`. In `cyclic` systems, `auto` is the same as
`bullets`. Otherwise, the effect is the same as
`speak-as: numbers`.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797019067328 primary=""
startref="ix_counter_ch16"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797019066320 primary=""

startref="ix_lists_counter_style_descs" data-type="indexterm"}

The exception to this rule arises if the system is an `extends` system,
in which case `auto`'s effects are determined based on the system being
extended. Therefore, given the following styles, the counters in an
`emojibrackets` list will be spoken as if `speak-as` were set to
`bullets`:[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797019060208 primary=""

Even though list styling isn't as sophisticated as we might like, the
ability to style lists is still highly useful. One relatively common use
is to take a list of links, remove the markers and indentation, and thus
create a navigation sidebar. The combination of simple markup and
flexible layout is difficult to resist.[]{#ch16.xhtml_idm45797018984976

Remember, if a markup language doesn't have intrinsic list elements,
generated content can be an enormous help---say, for inserting content
such as icons to point to certain types of links (PDF files, Word
documents, or even just links to another website). Generated content
also makes it easy to print out link URLs, and its ability to insert and
format quotation marks leads to true typographic joy. It's safe to say
that the usefulness of generated content is limited only by your
imagination. Even better, thanks to counters, you can now associate
ordering information to elements that are not typically lists, such as
headings or code blocks. If you want to support such features with
design that mimics the appearance of the user's operating system, read
on. The next chapter discusses ways to change the placement, shape, and
even perspective of your design.

Ever since the inception of CSS, elements have been rectangular and
firmly oriented on the horizontal and vertical axes. Several tricks
arose to make elements look like they were tilted and so on, but
underneath it all was a rigid grid.

With CSS *transforms*, you []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_transform_ch17
primary="transforms" data-type="indexterm"}have the ability to break
that visual grid and shake up the way your elements are presented.
Whether it's as simple as rotating some photographs a bit to make them
appear more natural, or creating interfaces where information can be
revealed by flipping over elements, or doing interesting perspective
tricks with sidebars, CSS transforms can---if you'll pardon the obvious
expression---transform the way you design.

# Coordinate Systems {#ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1605}

Before []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_transform_coord_sys primary="transforms"
secondary="coordinate systems used by"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_ix_coord_sys
primary="coordinate systems" data-type="indexterm"}embarking on this
journey, let's take a moment to orient ourselves. Specifically, let's
review the *coordinate systems* used to define positions or movement in
space as a sequence of measurements. Two types of coordinate systems are
used in transforms, and it's a good idea to be familiar with both.

The []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_xyz_coord primary="x/y/z coordinate system"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_ix_cartesian
primary="Cartesian coordinate system" data-type="indexterm"}first is the
*Cartesian coordinate system*, often called the *x/y/z coordinate
system*. This system describes the position of a point in space by using
two numbers (for two-dimensional placement) or three numbers (for
three-dimensional placement). In CSS, the system uses three axes: the
x-axis (horizontal); the y-axis (vertical); and the z-axis (depth). This
is illustrated in [Figure 17-1](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig01){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig01" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1701.png" width="497" height="800"
alt="css5 1701" />
<h6 id="ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1606"><span class="label">Figure 17-1.
</span>The three Cartesian axes used in CSS transforms</h6>
</div>
</figure>

For any two-dimensional (2D) transform, you need to worry about only the
x- and y-axes. By convention, positive x values go to the right, and
negative values go to the left. Similarly, positive y values go downward
along the y-axis, while negative values go upward along the y-axis.

That might seem a little weird, since we tend to think that higher
numbers should place something higher up, not lower down, as many of us
learned in pre-algebra. (This is why the "y" label is at the bottom of
the y-axis in [Figure 17-1](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig01){data-type="xref"}: the
labels are placed in the positive direction on all three axes.) If you
are experienced with absolute positioning in CSS, think of the `top`
property values for absolutely positioned elements: they get moved
downward for positive `top` values, and upward when `top` has a negative
length.

Given this, in order to move an element leftward and down, you would
give it a negative x and a positive y value. Here is one way to do this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
translateX(-5em) translateY(33px)
```

That is, in fact, a valid transform value, as you'll see in just a bit.
Its effect is to translate (move) the element 5 ems to the left and 33
pixels down, in that order.

If you []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_transform_3dstyle primary="transforms"
secondary="3D style for"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_ix_elem_frame primary="elements"
secondary="frame of reference" data-type="indexterm"}want to transform
something in three-dimensional (3D) space, you add a z-axis value. This
axis is the one that "sticks out" of the display and runs straight
through your head---in a theoretical sense, that is. Positive z values
are closer to you, and negative z values are farther away from you. In
this regard, it's very much like the `z-index` property.

So let's say that we want to take the element we moved before and add a
z-axis value:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
translateX(-5em) translateY(33px) translateZ(200px)
```

Now the element will appear 200 pixels closer to us than it would be
without the z value.

Well, you might wonder exactly how an element can be moved 200 pixels
closer to you, given that holographic displays are regrettably rare and
expensive. How many molecules of air between you and your monitor are
equivalent to 200 pixels? What does an element moving closer to you even
look like, and what happens if it gets *too* close? These are excellent
questions that we'll get to later. For now, just accept that moving an
element along the z-axis appears to move it closer or farther away.

The really important thing to remember is that every element carries its
own frame of reference and so considers its axes with respect to itself.
If you rotate an element, the axes rotate along with it, as illustrated
in [Figure 17-2](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig02){data-type="xref"}. Any further
transforms are calculated with respect to those rotated axes, not the
axes of the display.

</span>Elemental frames of reference</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Now, suppose you want to rotate an element 45 degrees clockwise in the
plane of the display (i.e., around the z-axis). Here's the transform
value you're most likely to use:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rotate(45deg)
```

Change that to `–45deg`, and the element will rotate counterclockwise
(anticlockwise for our international friends) around the
z-axis.[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018882304 primary=""
startref="ix_cartesian"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018881456 primary=""
startref="ix_xyz_coord" data-type="indexterm"} In other words, it will
rotate in the *xy* plane, as illustrated in
[Figure 17-3](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig05){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>

</span>Rotations in the xy plane</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Speaking of []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018877008
primary="spherical coordinate system" data-type="indexterm"}rotations,
the other coordinate system used in CSS transforms is a *spherical
system*, which describes angles in 3D space. It's illustrated in
[Figure 17-4](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig03){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>

</span>The spherical coordinate system used in CSS transforms</h6>
</div>
</figure>

For the purposes of 2D transforms, you have to worry about only a single
360-degree polar system: the one that sits on the plane described by the
x- and y-axes. When it comes to rotations, a 2D rotation actually
describes a rotation around the z-axis. Similarly, rotations around the
x-axis tilt the element toward or away from you, and rotations around
the y-axis turn the element from side to side. These are illustrated in
[Figure 17-5](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig04){data-type="xref"}.

One []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_transform_prop primary="transform property"

```
A \<*`transform-list`*\> is a space-separated list of functions defining
different transformations, like the examples used in the preceding
section. We'll dig into the specific functions you can use in a moment.

First off, let's clear up the []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018811104
primary="transforms" secondary="bounding box for"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018810128
primary="bounding box" data-type="indexterm"}matter of the bounding box.
For any element being affected by CSS, the *bounding box* is the border
box---the outermost edge of the element's border. Any outlines and
margins are ignored for the purposes of calculating the bounding box.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1613}

If a []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018808128 primary="table layout"
secondary="bounding box" data-type="indexterm"}table-display element is
being transformed, its bounding box is the table wrapper box, which
encloses the table box and any [associated]{.keep-together} caption box.
:::

If you're []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018805984 primary="object bounding box"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018805248
primary="SVG format" secondary="object bounding box"
data-type="indexterm"}transforming an SVG element with CSS, its bounding
box is its SVG-defined *object bounding box*.

Note that all transformed elements (e.g., elements with `transform` set
to a value other than `none`) have their own stacking context. (See
["Placement on the
Z-Axis"](../Text/ch10.xhtml#placement-on-the-z-axis){data-type="xref"}
for an explanation.)

While a scaled element may be much smaller or larger than it was before
the transform was applied, the actual space on the page that the element
occupies remains the same as before the transform was applied. This is
true for all the transform functions: when you translate or rotate an
element, its siblings don't automatically move out of the way.

Now, the value entry \<*`transform-list`*\> requires some explanation.
It refers to a list of one or more transform functions, one after the
other, in space-separated format. It looks something like this, with the
result shown in [Figure 17-6](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig06){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {transform: rotate(30deg) skewX(-25deg) scaleY(2);}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig06" class="figure">

</span>A transformed <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The functions are processed one at a time, starting with the first
(leftmost) and proceeding to the last (rightmost). This first-to-last
processing order is important, because changing the order can lead to
drastically different results. Consider the following two rules, which
have the results shown in
[Figure 17-7](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig07){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img#one {transform: translateX(200px) rotate(45deg);}
img#two {transform: rotate(45deg) translateX(200px);}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig07" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1707.png" width="600" height="262"
alt="css5 1707" />
<h6 id="ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1615"><span class="label">Figure 17-7.
</span>Different transform lists, different results</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first instance, an image is translated (moved) 200 pixels along
its x-axis and then rotated 45 degrees. In the second instance, an image
is rotated 45 degrees and then moved 200 pixels along its
x-axis---that's the x-axis of the transformed element, *not* of the
parent element, page, or viewport. In other words, when an element is
rotated, its x-axis (along with its other axes) rotates along with it.
All element transforms are conducted with respect to the element's own
frame of reference.

Note that when you have a series of transform functions, all of them
must be properly formatted; that is, they must be valid. If even one
function is invalid, it renders the entire value invalid. Consider the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img#one {transform: translateX(100px) scale(1.2) rotate(22);}
```

Because the value for `rotate()` is invalid---rotational values must be
an \<*`angle`*\>---the entire value is dropped. The image in question
will just sit there in its initial untransformed state, neither
translated nor scaled, let alone rotated.

In addition, transforms are not usually cumulative. If you apply a
transform to an element and then later want to add a transformation, you
need to restate the original transform. Consider the following
scenarios, illustrated in
[Figure 17-8](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig08){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#ex01 {transform: rotate(30deg) skewX(-25deg);}
#ex01 {transform: scaleY(2);}
#ex02 {transform: rotate(30deg) skewX(-25deg);}
#ex02 {transform: rotate(30deg) skewX(-25deg) scaleY(2);}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig08" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1708.png" width="600" height="216"
alt="css5 1708" />
<h6 id="ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1616"><span class="label">Figure 17-8.
</span>Overwriting or modifying transforms</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In the first case, the second rule completely replaces the first,
meaning that the element is scaled only along the y-axis. This makes
some sense; it's the same as if you declare a font size and then
elsewhere declare a different font size for the same element. You don't
get a cumulative font size that way. You just get one size or the other.
In the second example, the []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018593248
primary="scaleY() function" data-type="indexterm"}entirety of the first
set of transforms is included in the second set, so they all are applied
along with the `scaleY()` function.

If you're wishing for properties that apply to just a single type of
transformation, such as a property that only rotates or a property that
only scales elements, you'll see some later in the chapter, so hang in
there.

primary="elements" secondary="inline-level"

primary="inline-level elements" data-type="indexterm"}important caveat:
as of this writing, transforms are not applied to *atomic inline-level*
boxes. These are inline boxes like spans, hyperlinks, and so on. Those
elements can be transformed if their block-level parent is transformed,
in which case they go along for the ride. But you can't just rotate a
`<span>` unless you've changed its display role via `display: block`,
`display: inline-block`, or something along those lines. The reason for
this limitation boils down to an uncertainty. Suppose you have a
`<span>` (or any inline-level box) that breaks across multiple lines. If
you rotate it, what happens? Does each line box rotate with respect to
itself, or should all the line boxes be rotated as a single group?
There's no clear answer, and the debate continues, so for now you can't
directly transform inline-level boxes.[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018565952

These are []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018535232 primary="distance values"
data-type="indexterm"}usually referred to as the 2D *translation
functions*, since they can slide an element up and down, or side to
side, but not forward or backward along the z-axis. Each of these
functions accepts a single distance value, expressed as either a length
or a [percentage.]{.keep-together}

If the value is a length, the effect is about what you'd expect.
Translate an element 200 pixels along the x-axis with
`translateX(200px)`, and it will move 200 pixels to its right. Change
that to `translateX(-200px)`, and the element will move 200 pixels to
its left. For `translateY()`, positive values move the element downward,
while negative values move it upward.

Keep in mind that translations are always declared with respect to the
element itself. Thus, for example, if you flip the element upside down
by rotation, positive `translateY()` values will move the element
downward on the page, because that's a move upward from the upside-down
element's point of view.

If the []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018530512 primary="translate() function"
data-type="indexterm"}value is a percentage, the distance is calculated
as a percentage of the element's own size. Thus, if an element is 300
pixels wide and 200 pixels tall, `translateX(50%)` will move it 150
pixels to its right, and `translateY(-10%)` will move that same element
upward (with respect to itself) by 20 pixels.

If you want to translate an element along both the x- and y-axes at the
same time, `translate()` makes it easy. Just supply the x value first
and the y value second, separated by a comma, which is the same as if
you included both a `translateX()` and a `translateY()`. If you omit the
y value, it's assumed to be 0. Thus, `translate(2em)` is treated as if
it were `translate(2em,0)`, which is also the same as `translateX(2em)`.

The `translateZ()` function []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018510112
primary="translate3d() function" data-type="indexterm"}translates
elements along the z-axis, thus moving them into the third dimension.
Unlike the 2D translation functions, `translateZ()` accepts only length
values. Percentage values are *not* permitted for `translateZ()`, or
indeed for any z-axis value.

Much like `translate()` does for x and y translations, `translate3d()`
is a shorthand function that incorporates the x, y, and z translation
values into a single function. This is handy if you want to move an
element over, up, and forward in one fell swoop.

See [Figure 17-10](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig10){data-type="xref"} for an
illustration of how 3D translation works. Each arrow represents the
translation along that axis, arriving at a point in 3D space. The dashed
lines show the distance and direction from the origin point (the
intersection of the three axes) and the distance above the x*y* plane.

Unlike `translate()`, there is no fallback if `translate3d()` does not
contain three values. Thus, `translate3d(1em,-50px)` should be treated
as invalid by browsers, with no actual translation taking place as a
result.

Very much like the `translate()` function, the `translate` property
accepts from one to three length values, or two percentages and a length
value, or more reduced patterns such as a single length. Unlike the
`translate()` function, the `transform` property does not use commas to
separate its values.

If only one value is given, it is used as an x-axis translation. With
two values, the first is the x-axis translation, and the second is the
y-axis translation. With three values, they are taken in the order
`x y z`. Any missing values default to `0px`.

If you refer back to
[Figure 17-9](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig09){data-type="xref"}, the following
would yield the same results as are shown there:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
translate: 25px;    /* equivalent to 25px 0px 0px */
translate: 25%;
translate: 0 25px;  /* equivalent to 0 25px 0px */
translate: 0 -25px;
translate: 20% 20%;
translate: -20% -20%;
translate: 110% 25px;
```

Similarly, the following would have the same effect diagrammed in
[Figure 17-10](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig10){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
translate: 150px -50px 100px;
```

The default value, `none`, means that no translation is applied.

values at a ratio of 100:1; that is, `50%` will have the same effect as
`0.5`, and `200%` will have the same effect as `2`, and [so
on.]{.keep-together}

If you want to scale along both axes simultaneously, use `scale()`. The
x value is always first, and the y always second, so `scale(2,0.5)` will
make the element twice as wide and half as tall as it was before being
transformed. If you supply only one number, it is used as the scaling
value for both axes; thus, `scale(2)` will make the element twice as
wide *and* twice as tall. This is in contrast to `translate()`, where an
omitted second value is always set to 0. Using `scale(1)` will scale an
element to be exactly the same size it was before you scaled it, as will
`scale(1,1)`---just in case you were dying to do that.

[Figure 17-11](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig11){data-type="xref"} shows a few
examples of element scaling, using the single-axis scaling functions as
well as the combined `scale()`.

If you []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018346544 primary="scale3d() function"
data-type="indexterm"}can scale in two dimensions, you can also scale in
three. CSS offers `scaleZ()` for scaling just along the z-axis, and
`scale3d()` for scaling along all three axes at once. These have an
effect only if the element has any depth, which elements don't by
default. If you do make a change that conveys depth---say, rotating an
element around the x- or y-axis---then there is a depth that can be
scaled, and either `scaleZ()` or `scale3d()` can do so.

Similar to `translate3d()`, the `scale3d()` function requires all three
numbers to be valid. If you fail to do this, the malformed `scale3d()`
will invalidate the entire transform value to which it belongs.

Also note that scaling an element will change the effective distance of
any translations. For example, the following will cause the element to
be translated 50 pixels to its right:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
transform: scale(0.5) translateX(100px);
```

This is because the element is shrunk by 50%, and then moved to the
right by 100 pixels *within its own frame of reference*, which is
half-size. Switch the order of the functions, and the element will be
translated 100 pixels to its right and then shrunk 50% from that spot.

The way `scale` handles its values differs little from the `translate`
property. If you give only one value, such as `scale(2)`, that value is
used to scale in both the x and y directions. With two values, the first
is used to scale in the x-axis direction, and the second in the y-axis
direction. With three values, the third is used to scale in the z-axis
direction.

The following would have the same results as shown in
[Figure 17-11](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig11){data-type="xref"}.

All four basic rotation functions accept just one value: an angle. This
can be expressed using a number, either positive or negative, and then
any of the valid angle units (`deg`, `grad`, `rad`, and `turn`). (See
["Angles"](../Text/ch05.xhtml#angles){data-type="xref"} for more
details.) If a value's number runs outside the usual range for the given
unit, it will look as if it were given a value in the allowed range. In
other words, a value of `437deg` will be tilted the same as if it were
`77deg`, or, for that matter, `-283deg`.

Note, however, []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018169040 primary="animation"
secondary="of transforms" secondary-sortas="transforms"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018167760
primary="transforms" secondary="animated" data-type="indexterm"}that
these are visually equivalent only if you don't animate the rotation in
some fashion. That is to say, animating a rotation of `1100deg` will
spin the element around several times before coming to rest at a tilt of
--20 degrees (or 340 degrees, if you like). By contrast, animating a
rotation of `-20deg` will tilt the element a bit to the left, with no
spinning; and animating a rotation of `340deg` will animate an almost
full spin to the right. All three animations come to the same end state,
but the process of getting there is very different in each case.

The `rotate()` function is a straight 2D rotation, and the one you're
most likely to use. It is visually equivalent to `rotateZ()` because it
rotates the element around the z-axis. In a similar manner, `rotateX()`
causes rotation around the x-axis, thus causing the element to tilt
toward or away from you; and `rotateY()` rotates the element around its
y-axis, as though it were a door. These are all illustrated in

If you're comfortable with vectors and want to rotate an element through
3D space, `rotate3d()` is for you. The first three numbers specify the
x, y, and z components of a vector in 3D space, and the degree value
(angle) determines the amount of rotation around the declared 3D vector.

To start with a basic example, the 3D equivalent of `rotateZ(45deg)` is
`rotate3d(0,0,1,45deg)`. This specifies a vector of zero magnitude on
the x- and y-axes, and a magnitude of 1 along the z-axis; in other
words, the z-axis. The element is thus rotated 45 degrees around that
vector, as shown in
[Figure 17-13](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig13){data-type="xref"}. This figure also
shows the appropriate `rotate3d()` values to rotate an element by 45
degrees around the x- and y-axes.

</span>Rotations around 3D vectors</h6>
</div>
</figure>

A little more complicated is something like
`rotate3d(-0.95,0.5,1,45deg)`, where the described vector points off
into 3D space between the axes. To understand how this works, let's
start with a basic example: `rotateZ(45deg)` (illustrated in
[Figure 17-13](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig13){data-type="xref"}). The equivalent
is `rotate3d(0,0,1,45deg)`. The first three numbers describe the
components of a vector that has no x or y magnitude, and a z magnitude
of 1. Thus, it points along the z-axis in a positive direction---that
is, toward the viewer. The element is then rotated clockwise as you look
toward the origin of the vector.

Similarly, the 3D equivalent of `rotateX(45deg)` is
`rotate3d(1,0,0,45deg)`. The vector points along the x-axis in the
positive direction (to the right). If you stand at the end of that
vector and look toward its origin, you rotate the element 45 degrees
clockwise around the vector. Thus, from the usual viewer placement, the
top of the element rotates away from, and the bottom rotates toward, the
viewer.

Now let's make the example slightly more complex: suppose you have
`rotate3d(1,1,0,45deg)`. When viewed on your monitor, that describes a
vector running from the top-left to bottom-right corner, going right
through the center of the element (by default, anyway; we'll see how to
change that later). So the element's rectangle has a line running
through it at a 45-degree angle, effectively spearing it. Then the
vector rotates 45 degrees, taking the element with it. The rotation is
clockwise as you look back toward the vector's origin, so again, the top
of the element rotates away from the viewer, while the bottom rotates
toward the viewer. If we were to change the rotation to
`rotate3d(1,1,0,90deg)`, the element would be edge-on to the viewer,
tilted at a 45-degree angle and facing off toward the upper right. Try
it with a piece of paper: draw a line from the top left to bottom right,
and then rotate the paper around that line.

OK, so given all of that, now try visualizing how the vector is
determined for `rotate3d(-0.95,0.5,1,45deg)`. If we assume a cube 200
pixels on a side, the vector's components are 190 pixels to the *left*
along the x-axis, 100 pixels down along the y-axis, and 200 pixels
toward the views along the z-axis. The vector goes from the origin point
(0, 0, 0) to the point (--190 px, 100 px, 200 px).
[Figure 17-14](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig14){data-type="xref"} depicts that
vector, as well as the final result presented to the viewer.

So the vector is like a metal rod speared through the element being
rotated. As we look back along the line of the vector, the rotation is
45 degrees clockwise. But since the vector points left, down, and
forward, that means the top-left corner of the element rotates toward
the viewer, and the bottom right rotates away, as shown in
[Figure 17-14](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig14){data-type="xref"}.

Just to be crystal clear, `rotate3d(1,1,0,45deg)` is *not* equivalent to
`rotateX(45deg) rotateY(45deg) rotateZ(0deg)`! It's an easy mistake to
make, and many people---including your humble correspondent---have made
it. It seems like it should be equivalent, but it really isn't. If we
place that vector inside the imaginary 200 × 200 × 200 cube previously
mentioned, the axis of rotation would go from the origin point to a
point 200 pixels right and 200 pixels down (200, 200, 0).

Having done that, the axis of rotation is shooting through the element
from the top left to the bottom right, at a 45-degree angle. The element
then rotates 45 degrees clockwise around that diagonal, as you look back
toward its origin (the top left), which rotates the top-right corner of
the element away and a bit to the left, while the bottom-left corner
rotates closer and a bit to the right. []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797018129840

### The rotate property {#ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1643}

As with []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_rotate_prop primary="rotate property"
data-type="indexterm"}translations and scaling, CSS has a `rotate`
property that allows you to rotate elements around various axes without
having to use the `transform` property to do so. The value syntax to
make that possible is a bit different, however.

```{=html}

</aside>
```
The valid values are divided into three mutually exclusive syntax
options. The simplest is that the default value of `none` means no
rotation is applied.

If you want to rotate around a single axis, it's easiest to give the
axis identifier along with the angle you want to rotate. In the
following code, each line contains two equivalent ways of rotating an
element around a given axis:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
transform: rotateX(45deg);    rotate: x 45deg;
transform: rotateY(33deg);    rotate: y 33deg;
transform: rotateZ(-45deg);   rotate: z -45deg;
transform: rotate(90deg);     rotate: 90deg;
```

The last line is similar to the handling of the `rotate()` function
discussed earlier: a rotation with a single degree value is a 2D
rotation on the *xy* plane. (See
[Figure 17-12](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig12){data-type="xref"} for a refresher.)

If you want to define a 3D vector as the axis of rotation, the value of
`rotate` looks a little different. For example, suppose we want to
rotate an element 45 degrees around the vector --0.95, 0.5, 1, as
illustrated in [Figure 17-14](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig14){data-type="xref"}.
Either of the following two declarations will have this effect:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
transform: rotate3d(-0.95, 0.5, 1, 45deg);
rotate: -0.95 0.5 1 45deg;
```

If you want, you can use this pattern to rotate around the cardinal
axes; that is, `rotate: z 23deg` and `rotate: 0 0 1 23deg` will have
that same effect (as will `rotate: 23deg`). This can be useful when
changing the vector of rotation via JavaScript, but is rarely useful in
other cases.

Note that `transform` has a power that `rotate` cannot duplicate: the
ability to chain rotations in sequence. For example,
`transform: rotateZ(20deg) rotateY(30deg)` will first rotate the element
20 degrees around the z-axis, and then the result of that rotation is
rotated around the y-axis. The `rotate` property can do only one or the
other of these on its own. The only way to get the same result is to
figure out the vector and angle that will leave the element in the same
state as the `transform` operation did. The math to do that certainly
exists, but is outside the scope of this book (although see ["Matrix
Functions"](#ch17.xhtml_matrix_functions){data-type="xref"}).[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797017992416

When using the []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797017960608 primary="transforms"

data-type="indexterm"}individual transform properties, the effects are
always applied in the order `translate`, then `rotate`, then `scale`.

#mover {
	transform: translate(10rem) rotate(30deg) scale(1.5, 1);
}
```

This matters because, for example, translating and then rotating is very
different from rotating and then translating. If you need to have an
element's transforms happen in an order other than
transform-rotate-scale, use `transform` instead of the individual

Using `skew(a,b)` is different from including `skewX(a)` with
`skewY(b)`. The former specifies a 2D skew using the matrix operation
`[ax,ay]`. [Figure 17-17](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig17){data-type="xref"} shows
examples of this matrix skewing and how they differ from double-skew

For a variety of reasons, including the way `skew(a,b)` is different
from `skewX(a) skewY(b)`, the CSS specification explicitly discourages
the use of `skew()`. You should avoid using it if at all possible; we
document it here in case you find yourself coming across it in legacy
code.

In the CSS transforms specification, we find the trenchant description
of `matrix()` as a function that "specifies a 2D transformation in the
form of a transformation matrix of the six values *a*--*f*."

First things first: a valid `matrix()` value is a list of six
comma-separated numbers. No more, no less. The values can be positive or
negative. Second, the value describes the final transformed state of the
element, combining all of the other transform types (rotation, skewing,
and so on) into a compact syntax. Third, very few people use this syntax
to write code themselves, though it is often generated by drawing or
animation software.

We're not going to go through the complicated process of doing the
matrix math. For most readers, it would be an eye-watering wall of
apparent gibberish; for the rest, it would be time wasted on familiar
territory. You can certainly research the intricacies of matrix
calculations online, and we encourage anyone with an interest to do so.
We'll just look at the basics of syntax and usage in CSS.

Here's a brief rundown of how it works. Say you have this function
applied to an [element:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
matrix(0.838671, 0.544639, -0.692519, 0.742636, 6.51212, 34.0381)
```

That's the CSS syntax used to describe this transformation matrix:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
0.838671    -0.692519   0   6.51212
0.544639     0.742636   0   34.0381
0            0          1   0
0            0          0   1
```

Right. So what does that do? It has the result shown in
[Figure 17-18](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig20){data-type="xref"}, which is exactly
the same result as writing this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rotate(33deg) translate(24px,25px) skewX(-10deg)
```

</span>A matrix-transformed element and its functional equivalent</h6>
</div>
</figure>

What this comes down to is that if you're familiar with or need to use
matrix calculations, you can and should. Otherwise, you can chain much
more human-readable transform functions together and get the element to
the same end state.

Now, []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797017711360 primary="matrix3d() function"
data-type="indexterm"}that was for plain old 2D transforms. What if you
want to use a matrix to transform through three dimensions?

Again, just for kicks, we'll savor the definition of `matrix3d()` from
the CSS Transforms specification: "specifies a 3D transformation as a 4
× 4 homogeneous matrix of 16 values in column-major order." This means
the parameter of `matrix3d()` *must* be a list of 16 comma-separated
numbers, no more or less. Those numbers are arranged in a 4 × 4 grid in
column order, so the first column of the matrix is formed by the first
set of four numbers in the value, the second column by the second set of
four numbers, the third column by the third set, and so on. Thus, you
can take the following function,

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
matrix3d(
    0.838671, 0, -0.544639, 0.00108928,
    -0.14788, 1, 0.0960346, -0.000192069,
    0.544639, 0, 0.838671, -0.00167734,
    20.1281, 25, -13.0713, 1.02614)
```

and write it out as this matrix:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
  0.838671   -0.14788        0.544639     20.1281
  0           1              0            25
 -0.544639    0.0960346      0.838671    -13.0713
  0.00108928 -0.000192069   -0.00167734   1.02614
```

Both have an end state equivalent to the following, which is depicted in
[Figure 17-19](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig21){data-type="xref"}.

### A note on end-state equivalence {#ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1658}

It's []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797017504624 primary="transforms"
secondary="end-state equivalence" data-type="indexterm"}important to
keep in mind that only the end states of a `matrix()` function, and of
an equivalent chain of transform functions, can be considered identical.
This is for the same reason discussed in ["Element
Rotation"](#ch17.xhtml_element_rotation){data-type="xref"}: because a
rotation angle of `393deg` will end with the same visible rotation as an
angle of `33deg`. []{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797017501472 primary="animation"
secondary="of transforms" secondary-sortas="transforms"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797017500192
primary="transforms" secondary="animated" data-type="indexterm"}This
matters if you are animating the transformation, since the former will
cause the element to do a barrel roll in the animation, whereas the
latter will not. The `matrix()` version of this end state won't include
the barrel roll, either. Instead, it will always use the shortest
possible rotation to reach the end state.

To illustrate what this means, consider the following, a transform chain
and its `matrix()` equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rotate(200deg) translate(24px,25px) skewX(-10deg)
matrix(-0.939693, -0.34202, 0.507713, -0.879385, -14.0021, -31.7008)
```

Note the rotation of 200 degrees. We naturally interpret this to mean a
clockwise rotation of 200 degrees, which it is. If these two transforms
are animated, however, they will act differently: the chained-functions
version will indeed rotate 200 degrees clockwise, whereas the `matrix()`
version will rotate 160 degrees counterclockwise. Both will end up in
the same place but will get there in different ways.

Other differences can arise even when you might think they wouldn't.
Once again, this is because a `matrix()` transformation will always take
the shortest possible route to the end state, whereas a transform chain
might not. (In fact, it probably doesn't.) Consider these apparently
equivalent transforms:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
rotate(160deg) translate(24px,25px) rotate(-30deg) translate(-100px)
matrix(-0.642788, 0.766044, -0.766044, -0.642788, 33.1756, -91.8883)
```

As ever, they end up in the same place. When animated, though, the
elements will take different paths to reach that end state. They might
not be obviously different at first glance, but the difference is still
there.

None of this matters if you aren't animating the transformation, but
it's an important distinction to make nevertheless, because you never
know when you'll decide to start animating things. (Hopefully after
reading Chapters [18](../Text/ch18.xhtml#x-transitions){data-type="xref"
xrefstyle="select:labelnumber"} and

## Setting Element Perspective {#ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1659}

If you're []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_persp_func primary="perspective() function"
data-type="indexterm"}transforming an element in 3D space, you most
likely want it to have some perspective. *Perspective* gives the
appearance of front-to-back depth, and you can vary the degree of
perspective applied to an element.

  ----------- ----------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
It might seem a bit weird to specify perspective as a distance. After
all, `perspective(200px)`{.keep-together} seems odd when you can't
really measure pixels along the z-axis. And yet, here we are. You supply
a length, and the illusion of depth is constructed around that value.

Smaller numbers create a more extreme perspective, as though you are up
close to the element. Higher numbers create a gentler perspective, as
though viewing the element through a zoom lens from far away. *Really*
high perspective values create an isometric effect, which looks the same
as no perspective at all.

This makes a certain amount of sense. You can visualize perspective as a
pyramid, with its apex point at the perspective origin (by default, the
center of the untransformed element's position) and its base as the
browser window that you're looking through. A shorter distance between
apex and base will create a shallower pyramid, and thus a more extreme
distortion. This is illustrated in
[Figure 17-20](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig18){data-type="xref"}, with
hypothetical pyramids representing 200-pixel, 800-pixel, and 2,000-pixel
perspective distances.

In [documentation for
Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/InternetWeb/Conceptual/SafariVisualEffectsProgGuide/Using2Dand3DTransforms/Using2Dand3DTransforms.xhtml),
Apple writes that perspective values below `300px` tend to be extremely
distorted, values above `2000px` create "very mild" distortion, and
values between `500px` and `1000px` create "moderate perspective." To
illustrate this, [Figure 17-21](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig19){data-type="xref"}
shows a series of elements with the exact same rotation as displayed
with varying [perspective values.]{.keep-together}

<figure>
<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig19" class="figure">

</span>The effects of varying perspective values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Perspective values must always be positive, nonzero lengths. Any other
value will cause the `perspective()` function to be ignored. Also note
that its placement in the list of functions is important. If you look at
the code for [Figure 17-21](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig19){data-type="xref"}, the
`perspective()`{.keep-together} function comes before the `rotateY()`
function:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#ex1 {transform: perspective(100px) rotateY(-45deg);}
#ex2 {transform: perspective(250px) rotateY(-45deg);}
#ex3 {transform: perspective(500px) rotateY(-45deg);}
#ex4 {transform: perspective(1250px) rotateY(-45deg);}
```

If you were to reverse the order, the rotation would happen before the
perspective is applied, so all four examples in
[Figure 17-21](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig19){data-type="xref"} would look
exactly the same. So if you plan to apply a perspective value via the
list of transform functions, make sure it comes first, or at the [very
least]{.keep-together} before any transforms that depend on it.

is the default behavior, but with the property `transform-origin`, you
can change it.

```
The syntax definition looks really abstruse and confusing, but it's
fairly simple in practice. With `transform-origin`, you supply two or
three lengths or keywords to define the point around which transforms
should be made: first the horizontal, then the vertical, and optionally
a length along the z-axis. For the horizontal and vertical axes, you can
use plain-English keywords like `top` and `right`, percentages, lengths,
or a combination of keywords and percentage or length values. For the
z-axis, you can't use plain-English keywords or percentages, but can use
any length value. Pixels are by far the most common.

Length values are taken as a distance starting from the top-left corner
of the element. Thus, `transform-origin: 5em 22px` will place the
transform origin 5 ems in from the left side of the element, and 22
pixels down from the top of the element. Similarly,
`transform-origin: 5em 22px -200px` will place it 5 ems over, 22 pixels
down, and 200 pixels away (that is, 200 pixels behind the untransformed
position of the element).

Percentages are calculated with respect to the corresponding axis and
size of the element's bounding box, as offsets from the element's
top-left corner. For example, `transform-origin: 67% 40%` will place the
transform origin 67 percent of the width to the right of the element's
left side, and 40 percent of the element's height down from the
element's top side.
[Figure 17-22](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig22){data-type="xref"} illustrates a few
origin calculations.

<figure>

</figure>

All right, so if you change the origin, what happens? The easiest way to
visualize this is with 2D rotations. Suppose you rotate an element 45
degrees to the right. Its final placement will depend on its origin.
[Figure 17-23](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig23){data-type="xref"} illustrates the
effects of several transform origins; in each case, the transform origin
is marked with a circle.

<figure>

</span>Rotational effects using various transform origins</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The origin matters for other transform types, such as skews and scales.
Scaling down an [element]{.keep-together} with its origin in the center
will pull in all sides equally, whereas scaling down an element with a
bottom-right origin will cause it to shrink toward that corner.
Similarly, skewing an element with respect to its center will result in
the same shape as if it's skewed with respect to the top-right corner,
but the placement of the shape will be different. Some examples are
shown in [Figure 17-24](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig24){data-type="xref"}; again,
each transform origin is marked with a circle.

The one transform type that isn't really affected by changing the
transform origin is translation. If you move an element around with
`translate()` or its cousins like `translateX()` and `translateY()`, or
the `translate` property, the element is going to end up in the same
place regardless of where the transform's origin is located. If that's
all the transforming you plan to do, setting the transform origin is
irrelevant. If you ever do anything besides translating, though, the
origin will matter. Use it wisely.[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797017171232

Two of the values are directly related to CSS when styling HTML:

`border-box`

:   Use the element's border box (defined by the outer border edge) as
    the reference box for transforms.

`content-box`

:   Use the element's content box as the reference box for transforms.

The remaining three are designed for SVG purposes, though they can also
apply in HTML contexts:

`fill-box`

:   Use the element's object bounding box as the reference box.

`stroke-box`

:   Use the element's stroke bounding box as the reference box.

`view-box`

:   Use the element's nearest SVG viewport as the reference box.

Using `fill-box` in an SVG context causes transforms to be performed on
the element in question, as we would expect from HTML. The default
`view-box`, on the other hand, causes all transforms to be calculated
with respect to the origin of the coordinate system established by the
SVG `viewBox` attribute. The difference is illustrated in
[Figure 17-25](#ch17.xhtml_transform-box-compare){data-type="xref"},
which is the result of the following SVG file and the CSS it contains:

``` {code-language="svg" data-type="programlisting"}

The first square, on the left, is rotated 20 degrees from its starting
point, with the center of rotation as the top left of the entire SVG
file (the top-left corner of the dashed-line box). This is because the
value of `transform-box` for this square is `view-box`. The second

its own fill box---what in HTML we would call the background area---as

Suppose you want to move an element "closer" to your eye, and then tilt
it away a bit, with a moderate amount of perspective. You might use
something like this rule:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#inner {transform: perspective(750px) translateZ(60px) rotateX(45deg);}

<div id="outer">
outer
<div id="inner">inner</div>
</div>
```

So you do that and get the result shown in
[Figure 17-26](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig25){data-type="xref"}---more or less
what you might expect.

<figure>
<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig25" class="figure">

</span>A 3D-transformed inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></h6>
</div>
</figure>

But then you decide to rotate the outer `<div>` to one side, and
suddenly nothing makes sense anymore. The inner `<div>` isn't where you
envisioned it. In fact, it just looks like a picture pasted to the front
of the outer `<div>`.

Well, that's exactly what it is, because the default value of
`transform-style` is `flat`. The inner `div` got drawn in its
moved-forward, tilted-back state, and that was applied to the front of
the outer `<div>` as if it were an image. So when you rotated the outer
`<div>`, as shown in
[Figure 17-27](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig27){data-type="xref"}, the flat picture
rotated right along with it:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#outer {transform: perspective(750px) rotateY(60deg) rotateX(-20deg);}
div#inner {transform: perspective(750px) translateZ(60px) rotateX(45deg);}
```

Change the value to `preserve-3d`, however, and the result is very
different. The inner `div` will be drawn as a full 3D object with
respect to its parent outer `<div>`, floating in space nearby, and *not*
as a picture pasted on the front of the outer `<div>`. You can see the
results of this change in
[Figure 17-27](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig27){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#outer {transform: perspective(750px) rotateY(60deg) rotateX(-20deg);
    transform-style: preserve-3d;}
div#inner {transform: perspective(750px) translateZ(60px) rotateX(45deg);}
```

One important aspect of `transform-style` is that it can be overridden
by other properties. The reason is that some values of these other
properties require a flattened presentation of an element and its
children in order to work. In such cases, the value of `transform-style`
is forced to be `flat`, regardless of what you may have declared.

So, to avoid this overriding behavior, make sure the following
properties are set to the listed values on any 3D-transformed container
elements that also have 3D-transformed [children:]{.keep-together}

-   `overflow: visible`

-   `filter: none`

-   `clip: auto`

-   `clip-path: none`

-   `mask-image: none`

-   `mask-border-source: none`

-   `mix-blend-mode: normal`

-   `isolation: auto`

Those are all the default values for those properties, so as long as you
don't try to change any of them for your preserved 3D elements, you're
fine! But if you find that editing some CSS suddenly flattens out your
lovely 3D transforms, one of these properties might be the
culprit.[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797016672384 primary=""

Two []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_transf_persp primary="transforms"

As a quick example, if you want to create a very deep perspective, one
mimicking the results you'd get from a zoom lens, you might declare
something like `perspective: 2500px`. For a shallow depth, one that
mimics a close-up fish-eye lens effect, you might declare
`perspective: 200px`.

So how does this differ from the `perspective()` function? When you use
`perspective()`{.keep-together}, you're defining the perspective effect
for the element that is given that function. So if you write
`transform: perspective(800px) rotateY(-50grad);`, you're applying that
perspective to each element that has the rule applied.

With the `perspective` property, on the other hand, you're creating a
shared perspective for all the child elements of the element that
received the property. Here's an illustration of the difference, as
shown in [Figure 17-28](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig28){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {transform-style: preserve-3d; border: 1px solid gray; width: 660px;}
img {margin: 10px;}
#func {perspective: none;}
#func img {transform: perspective(800px) rotateX(-50grad);}
#prop {perspective: 800px;}
#prop img {transform: rotateX(-50grad);}
```

</div>
</figure>

In [Figure 17-28](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig28){data-type="xref"}, we first see
a line of images that haven't been transformed. In the second line, each
image has been rotated 50 gradians (equivalent to 45 degrees) toward us,
but each one within its own individual perspective.

In the third line of images, none has an individual perspective.
Instead, all are drawn within the perspective defined by
`perspective: 800px;` that's been set on the `<div>` that contains them.
Since they all operate within a shared perspective, they look
"correct"---that is, as we would expect if we had three physical
pictures mounted on a clear sheet of glass and rotated that toward us
around its center horizontal axis.

This is the critical difference between `perspective`, the property, and
`perspective()`{.keep-together}, the function. The former creates a 3D
space shared by all its children. The latter affects only the element to
which it's applied. Another difference is that the effect of the
`perspective()` function is different depending on when it is called in
the chain of transforms. The `perspective` property is always applied
before all other transforms, which is what you normally want to create a
3D effect.

In most cases, you're going to use the `perspective` property instead of
the `perspective()`{.keep-together} function. In fact, container
`<div>`s (or other elements) are a common feature of 3D transforms---the
way they used to be for page layout---largely to establish a shared
perspective. In the previous example, the `<div id="two">` is there
solely to serve as a perspective container, so to speak. On the other
hand, we couldn't have done what we did without
it.[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797016538640 primary="" startref="ix_persp_func2"

When []{#ch17.xhtml_ix_persp_orig_prop
primary="perspective-origin property" data-type="indexterm"}transforming
elements in three dimensions, a perspective will be used. (See
`transform-style` and `perspective` in previous sections.) That
perspective will have an origin, which is also known as the *vanishing
point*, and you can change its location with the `perspective-origin`
property.

With `perspective-origin`, you define the point on which sight lines
converge, and as with `perspective`, that point is defined relative to a
parent container.

As with most 3D transform properties, this is more easily demonstrated
than described. Consider the following CSS and markup, illustrated in
[Figure 17-29](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig29){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#container {perspective: 850px; perspective-origin: 50% 0%;}
#ruler {height: 50px; background: #DED url(tick.gif) repeat-x;
    rotate: x 60deg;
    transform-origin: 50% 100%;}

<div id="container">
    <div id="ruler"></div>
</div>
```

<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig29" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1682"><span class="label">Figure 17-29.
</span>A basic “ruler”</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We have a repeated background image of tick marks on a ruler, with the
`<div>` that contains them tilted away from us by 60 degrees. All the
lines point at a common vanishing point, the top center of the container
`<div>` (because of the `50% 0%` value for `perspective-origin`).

Now consider that same setup with various perspective origins
([Figure 17-30](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig30){data-type="xref"}).

<figure class="bordernone">
<div id="ch17.xhtml_tf_fig30" class="figure">

</div>
</figure>

As you can see, moving the perspective origin changes the rendering of
the 3D-transformed element. Note that these have an effect only because
we supplied a value for `perspective`. If the value of `perspective` is
ever the default `none`, any value given for `perspective-origin` will
be ignored. That makes sense, since you can't have a perspective origin
when there's no perspective at all\![]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797016409552

would it look like if we could see the back side of the element?" With
3D transforms, if there comes a day when you *do* see the back side of
an element, CSS has you covered. What happens is determined by the
property `backface-visibility`.

Unlike many of the other properties and functions we've already talked
about, this one is pretty uncomplicated. All it does is determine
whether the back side of an element is rendered when it's facing toward
the viewer, or not. That's it.

So let's say you flip over two elements, one with `backface-visibility`
set to [the default]{.keep-together} value of `visible` and the other
set to `hidden`. You get the result shown in
[Figure 17-31](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig31){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
span {border: 1px solid red; display: inline-block;}

img#hide {backface-visibility: hidden;}

<span><img src="salmon.gif" alt="salmon"></span>

<h6 id="ch17.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1686"><span class="label">Figure 17-31.
</span>Visible and hidden backfaces</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As you can see, the first image is unchanged. The second is flipped over
its x-axis, so we see it from the back. The third has also been flipped,
but we can't see it at all because its backface has been hidden.

This property can come in handy in several situations. In the simplest,
you have two elements that represent the two sides of a UI element that
flips over---say, a search area with preference settings on its back, or
a photo with some information on the back. Let's take the latter case.
The CSS and markup might look something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {position: relative;}
img, div {position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; backface-visibility: hidden;}
div {rotate: y 180deg;}
section:hover {rotate: y 180deg; transform-style: preserve-3d;}

<section>
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="info">(…info goes here…)</div>
</section>
```

(This would be a lot more interesting with an animated rotation, causing
the card to flip over in 3D space.)

A variant of this example uses the same markup, but slightly different
CSS to show the image's backface when it's flipped over. This is
probably more what was intended, since it makes information look like
it's literally written on the back of the image. It leads to the end
result shown in [Figure 17-32](#ch17.xhtml_tf_fig32){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
section {position: relative;}
img, div {position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;}
div {rotate: y 180deg; backface-visibility: hidden;
    background: rgba(255,255,255,0.85);}
section:hover {rotate: y 180deg; transform-style: preserve-3d;}
```

</span>Photo on the front, information on the back</h6>
</div>
</figure>

All we had to do to make that happen was shift
`backface-visibility: hidden` to the `<div>` instead of applying it to
both the `<img>` and the `<div>`. Thus, the `<div>`'s backface is hidden
when it's flipped over, but that of the image is not. (Well, that and
use a semitransparent background so we could see both the text and the
flipped image underneath it.)[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797016029680 primary=""

With the ability to transform elements in two- and three-dimensional
space, CSS transforms provide a great deal of power to designers. From
creating interesting combinations of 2D transforms, to creating a fully
3D-acting interface, transforms open up a great deal of new territory in
the design space. Some dependencies exist between properties, which is
something that not every CSS author will find natural at first, but they
become second nature with practice.[]{#ch17.xhtml_idm45797016026688
primary="" startref="ix_transform_ch17" data-type="indexterm"}

One of the things authors often do with transforms is animate them, so
that a card flips over, an element scales and rotates smoothly, and so
on. In the next two chapters, we'll get into the details of how those
transitions and animations are defined.

CSS []{#ch18.xhtml_ix_transition_ch18 primary="transitions"
data-type="indexterm"}transitions allow us to animate CSS properties
from an original value to a new value over time. These changes
*transition* an element from one state to another, in response to a
change. This usually involves a user interaction but can also be due to
a scripted change of class, ID, or other state.

Normally, when a CSS property value changes---when a *style change
event* occurs---the change is instantaneous. The new property value
replaces the old property in the milliseconds it takes to repaint the
page (or to reflow and repaint, when necessary). Most value changes seem
instantaneous, taking fewer than 16 milliseconds to render. Even if the
changes take longer than that (like when a large image is replaced with
one that isn't pre-fetched---which isn't a transition, just poor
performance), it is still a single step from one value to the next. For
example, when changing a background color on mouse hover, the background
immediately changes from one color to the other, with no gradual
transition.

::::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="CSS Transitions" data-type="sect1"}
:::::: {#ch18.xhtml_css-transitions .sect1}
# CSS Transitions {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1689}

CSS transitions provide a way to control how a property changes from one
value to the next over a period of time. Thus, we can make the property
values change gradually, creating (hopefully) pleasant and unobtrusive
effects. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
button {color: magenta;
    transition: color 200ms ease-in 50ms;
}
button:hover {color: rebeccapurple;
    transition: color 200ms ease-out 50ms;
}
```

In this example, instead of instantaneously changing a button's `color`
value on hover, that `transition` property means the button's `color`
will gradually fade from `magenta` to `rebeccapurple` over 200
milliseconds, even adding a 50-millisecond delay before starting [the
transition.]{.keep-together}

In the unlikely event that a browser doesn't support CSS transition
properties, the change is immediate instead of gradual, which is
completely fine. If a given property or some property values aren't
animatable, again, the change will be immediate instead of gradual.

property definition boxes throughout the book indicate whether a given
property is [animatable.]{.keep-together}
:::

Often you will want instantaneous value changes. For example, link
colors usually change instantly on hover or focus, informing sighted
users that an interaction is occurring and that the focused content is a
link. Similarly, options in an autocomplete listbox shouldn't fade in:
you want the options to appear instantly, rather than fade in more
slowly than the user types. Instantaneous value changes are often the
best user experience.

At other times, you'll want a property's value to change more gradually,
bringing attention to what is occurring. For example, you may want to
make a card game more realistic by taking 200 milliseconds to animate
the flipping of a card, as the user may not realize what happened if
there is no animation.

# Transition Properties {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1694}

In CSS, transitions are written using four transition properties:
`transition-property`, `transition-duration`,
`transition-timing-function`, and `transition-delay`, along with the
`transition` property as a shorthand for those four.

To []{#ch18.xhtml_ix_transition_transform primary="transitions"
secondary="on transform property" secondary-sortas="transform property"
data-type="indexterm"}create the drop-down navigation in
[Figure 18-1](#ch18.xhtml_tr_fig01){data-type="xref"}, we used all four
CSS transition properties, as well as some transform properties defining
the beginning and end states of the transition. The following code
defines the transition for that example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav li ul {
    transition-property: transform;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    transition-delay: 50ms;
    transform: scale(1, 0);
    transform-origin: top center;
}
nav li:is(:hover, :focus) ul {
    transform: scale(1, 1);
}
```

Although we are using the `:hover` and `:focus` states for the style
change event in this example, you can transition properties in other
scenarios too. For example, you might add or remove a class, or
otherwise change the state---say, by changing an input from `:invalid`
to `:valid` or from `:checked` to `:not(:checked)`. Or you might append
a table row at the end of a zebra-striped table or a list item at the
end of a list with styles based on `:nth-last-of-type` selectors.

In [Figure 18-1](#ch18.xhtml_tr_fig01){data-type="xref"}, the initial
[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_initial_transition
primary="initial state, transitions and animations"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_transition_initial_state
primary="transitions" secondary="initial state"
data-type="indexterm"}state of the nested lists is
`transform:`{.keep-together} `scale(1, 0)` with a
`transform-origin: top center`. The final state [ is
`transform:`]{.keep-together} `scale(1, 1)`, while the
`transform-origin` remains the same. (For more information on transform
properties, see
[Chapter 17](../Text/ch17.xhtml#transforms){data-type="xref"}.)

In this example, the transition properties define a transition on the
`transform` property: when the new `transform` value is set on `hover`,
the nested unordered list scales to its original, default size, changing
smoothly between the old value of `transform: scale(1, 0)` and the new
value of `transform: scale(1, 1)`, all over a period of 200
milliseconds. This transition starts after a 50-millisecond delay, and
*eases in*, which means it proceeds slowly at first, then picks up speed
as it progresses.

Whenever an animatable target property changes, if a transition is set
on that property, the browser will apply a transition to make the change
gradual.

Note that all the transition properties were set for the default
unhovered/unfocused state of the `<ul>` elements. These states were used
to change only the transform, not the transition. There's a very good
reason for this: it means that the menus not only will slide open when
the state change happens, but also will slide closed when the hover or
focus state ends.

Imagine that the transition properties were applied to the interaction
states instead, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav li ul {
    transform: scale(1, 0);
    transform-origin: top center;
}
nav li:is(:hover, :focus) ul {
    transition-property: transform;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    transition-delay: 50ms;
    transform: scale(1, 1);
}
```

That would mean that when *not* hovered or focused, the element would
have default transition values---which is to say, no transitions or
instantaneous transitions. The menus in our previous example would slide
open, but instantly disappear when the interaction state ends---because
no longer being in an interactive state, the transition properties would
no longer apply!

Maybe you want exactly this effect: slide smoothly open but instantly
disappear. If so, then apply the transitions as shown in the previous
example. Otherwise, apply them to the element in the default state
directly so that the transitions will apply as the interaction state is
both entered and exited. When the state change is exited, the transition
timing is reversed. You can override this default reverse transition by
declaring different transitions in both the initial and changed states.

By *initial state*, we mean a state that matches the element at page
load time. It could mean a content-editable element that could get
`:focus`, as in the following:
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/18-transitions/contenteditable.xhtml){.play}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* selector that matches elements all the time */
p[contenteditable] {
    background-color: background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0);
}
/* selector that matches elements some of the time */
p[contenteditable]:focus {
    /* overriding declaration */
    background-color: background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
}
```

In this example, the fully transparent background is always the initial
state, changing only when the user gives the element focus. This is what
we mean when we say *initial* or *default* value throughout this
chapter. The transition properties included in the selector that matches
the element all the time will impact that element whenever the state
changes, including from the initial state to the changed state (being
focused, in the preceding example).

An initial state could also be a temporary state that may change, such
as a `:checked` checkbox or a `:valid` form control, or even a class
that gets toggled on and off:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* selector that matches elements some of the time */
input:valid {
    border-color: green;
}
/* selector that matches elements some of the time,
   when the prior selector does NOT match. */
input:invalid {
    border-color: red;
}
/* selector that matches elements some of the time,
   whether the input is valid or invalid */
input:focus {
    /* alternative declaration */
    border-color: yellow;
}
```

In this example, either the `:valid` or `:invalid` selector can match
any given element, but never both. The `:focus` selector, as shown in
[Figure 18-2](#ch18.xhtml_tr_fig0202){data-type="xref"}, matches
whenever an input has focus, regardless of whether the input is matching
the `:valid` or `:invalid` selector [simultaneously.]{.keep-together}

In this case, when we refer to the initial state, we are referring to
the original value, which could be either `:valid` or
`:invalid`{.keep-together}. The changed state for a given element is the
opposite of the initial `:valid` or `:invalid` state.

Remember, you can apply different transition values to the initial and
changed states, but you always want to apply the value used when you
*enter* a given state. Take the following code as an example, where the
transitions are set up to have menus slide open over 2 seconds but close
in just 200 milliseconds:[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797015552912 primary=""
startref="ix_initial_transition" data-type="indexterm"}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav li ul {
    transition-property: transform;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
    transition-delay: 50ms;
    transform: scale(1, 0);
    transform-origin: top center;
}
nav li:is(:hover, :focus) ul {
    transition-property: transform;
    transition-duration: 2s;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
    transition-delay: 1s;
    transform: scale(1, 1);
}
```

This provides a horrible user experience, but it illustrates the point.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/18-transitions/menus-very-slow-transition.xhtml){.play}
When hovered or focused, the opening of the navigation takes a full 2
seconds. When closing, it quickly closes over 0.2 seconds. The
transition properties in the changed state are in force when a list item
is hovered or focused. Thus, the `transition-duration: 2s` defined for
these states takes effect. When a menu is no longer hovered or focused,
it returns to the default scaled-down state, and the transition
properties of the initial state---the `nav li ul` condition---are used,
causing the menu to take 200 milliseconds to close.

Look more closely at the example, specifically the default transition
styles. When the user stops hovering over or focusing on the parent
navigational element or the child drop-down menu, the drop-down menu
delays 50 milliseconds before starting the `200ms` transition to close.
This is actually a decent user experience style, because it give users a
chance (however brief) to get the mouse pointer or focused ring back on
a menu before it starts [closing]{.keep-together}.

While the four transition properties can be declared separately, you
will probably always use the shorthand. We'll take a look at the four
properties individually first so you have a good understanding of what
each one does.[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797015434176 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_transition_prop_prop
primary="transition-property property" data-type="indexterm"} specifies
the names of the CSS properties you want to transition. This allows you
to limit the transition to only certain properties, while having other
properties change instantaneously. And, yes, it's weird to say "the
`transition-property` property."

The value of `transition-property` is a comma-separated list of
properties; the keyword `none` if you want no properties transitioned;
or the default `all`, which means "transition all the animatable
properties." You can also include the keyword `all` within a
comma-separated list of properties.

If you include `all` as the only keyword---or default to `all`---all
animatable properties will transition in unison. Let's say you want to
change a box's appearance on hover:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    color: #ff0000;
    border: 1px solid #00ff00;
    border-radius: 0;
    transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg);
    opacity: 1;
    box-shadow: 3px 3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
    width: 50px;
    padding: 100px;
}
div:hover {
    color: #000000;
    border: 5px dashed #000000;
    border-radius: 50%;
    transform: scale(2) rotate(-10deg);
    opacity: 0.5;
    box-shadow: -3px -3px rgb(255 0 0 / 0.5);
    width: 100px;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

When the mouse pointer hovers over the `<div>`, every property that has
a different value in the initial state versus the hovered (changed)
state will change to the hover-state values.
[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797015296224 primary="animatable properties"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797015295616
primary="properties" secondary="animatable"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797015294704
primary="transitions" secondary="animatable properties for"
data-type="indexterm"}The `transition-property` property is used to
define which of those properties are animated over time (versus those
that change instantly, without animating). All the properties change
from the default value to the hovered value on `hover`, but only the
animatable properties included in the `transition-property` will change
over the transition's duration. Nonanimatable properties like
`border-style` change from one value to the next instantly.

If `all` is the only value or the last value in the comma-separated
value for `transition-property`, all the animatable properties will
transition in unison. Otherwise, provide a comma-separated list of
properties to be affected by the transition properties.

Thus, if we want to transition all the properties, the following
statements are almost equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    color: #ff0000;
    border: 1px solid #00ff00;
    border-radius: 0;
    opacity: 1;
    width: 50px;
    padding: 100px;
    transition-property: color, border, border-radius, opacity,
        width, padding;
    transition-duration: 1s;
}
div {
    color: #ff0000;
    border: 1px solid #00ff00;
    border-radius: 0;
    opacity: 1;
    width: 50px;
    padding: 100px;
    transition-property: all;
    transition-duration: 1s;
}
```

Both `transition-property` property declarations will transition all the
properties listed---but the former will transition only the six
properties that may change.

The `transition-property: all` in the latter rule ensures that *all*
animatable property values that would change based on any style change
event---no matter which CSS rule block includes the changed property
value---transitions over 1 second. The transition applies to all
animatable properties applied to all the elements matched by the
selector, not just the properties declared in the same style block as
the `all`.

In this case, the first version limits the transition to only the six
properties listed, but enables us to provide more control over how each
property will transition. Declaring the properties individually lets us
provide different speeds, delays, [and/or]{.keep-together} durations to
each property's transition:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    color: #ff0000;
    border: 1px solid #0f0;
    border-radius: 0;
    opacity: 1;
    width: 50px;
    padding: 100px;
}
.foo {
    color: #00ff00;
    transition-property: color, border, border-radius, opacity,
        width, padding;
    transition-duration: 1s;
}
```

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<div class="foo">Hello</div>
```

If you want to define the transitions for each property separately,
write them all out, separating each of the properties with a comma. If
you want to animate almost all the properties with the same duration,
delay, and pace, with a few exceptions, you can use a combination of
`all` and the individual properties you want to transition at different
times, speeds, or paces. Just make sure to use `all` as the first value,
because any properties listed before the `all` will be included in the
`all`, overriding any other transition property values you intended to
apply to those now overridden properties:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    color: #f00;
    border: 1px solid #00ff00;
    border-radius: 0;
    opacity: 1;
    width: 50px;
    padding: 100px;
    transition-property: all, border-radius, opacity;
    transition-duration: 1s, 2s, 3s;
}
```

The `all` part of the comma-separated value includes all the properties
listed in the example, as well as all the inherited CSS properties, and
all the properties defined in any other CSS rule block matching or
inherited by the element.

In the preceding example, all the properties getting new values will
transition at the same duration, delay, and timing function, with the
exception of `border-radius` and `opacity`, which we've explicitly
included separately. Because we included them as part of a
comma-separated list after the `all`, we can transition them at the same
time, delay, and timing function as all the other properties, or we can
provide different times, delays, and timing functions for these two
properties. In this case, we transition all the
[properties]{.keep-together} over 1 second, except for `border-radius`
and `opacity`, which we transition over 2 seconds and 3 seconds,
respectively. (The `transition-duration` property is covered in an
[upcoming section.]{.keep-together})

While []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797014894880 primary="transitions"
secondary="suppressing" data-type="indexterm"}transitioning over time
doesn't happen by default, if you do include a CSS transition and want
to override that transition in a particular scenario, you can set
`transition-property: none` to override the entire transition and ensure
that no properties are transitioned.

The `none` keyword can be used as only a unique value of the
property---you can't include it as part of a comma-separated list of
properties. If you want to override the transition of a limited set of
properties, you will have to list all of the properties you still want
to transition. You can't use the `transition-property` property to
exclude properties; rather, you can use that property only to include
them.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1699}

Another method is to set the delay and duration of the property to `0s`.
That way, it will appear instantaneously, as if no CSS transition is
being applied to it.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_event_transition
primary="events" secondary="transition"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797014884384
primary="TransitionEvent Interface"
data-type="indexterm"}TransitionEvent Interface provides for four
transition-related events: `transitionstart`, `transitionrun`,
`transitionend`, and `transitioncancel`. We'll concentrate on
`transitionend`, as it's the one that can be triggered multiple times by
a single piece of CSS.

A `transitionend` event is fired at the end of every transition, in
either direction, for every property that is transitioned over any
amount of time *or* after any delay. This happens whether the property
is declared individually or is part of the `all` declaration. Some
seemingly simple property declarations will use several `transitionend`
events, as every animatable property within a shorthand property gets
its own `transitionend`{.keep-together} event. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    color: #f00;
    border: 1px solid #00ff00;
    border-radius: 0;
    opacity: 1;
    width: 50px;
    padding: 100px;
    transition-property: all, border-radius, opacity;
    transition-duration: 1s, 2s, 3s;
}
```

When the transitions conclude, well over six `transitionend` events will
have occurred. For example, the `border-radius` transition alone
produces four `transitionend` events, one each for the following:

-   `border-bottom-left-radius`

-   `border-bottom-right-radius`

-   `border-top-right-radius`

-   `border-top-left-radius`

The `padding` property is also shorthand for four longhand properties:

-   `padding-top`

-   `padding-right`

-   `padding-bottom`

-   `padding-left`

The `border` shorthand property produces eight `transitionend` events:
four values for the four properties represented by the `border-width`
shorthand, and four for the properties represented by `border-color`:

-   `border-left-width`

-   `border-right-width`

-   `border-top-width`

-   `border-bottom-width`

-   `border-top-color`

-   `border-left-color`

-   `border-right-color`

-   `border-bottom-color`

The `border-style` properties have no `transitionend` events, however,
as `border-style` is not an animatable property.

There will be 19 `transitionend` events in the scenario where six
specific properties---`color`, `border`, `border-radius`, `opacity`,
`width`, and `padding`---are listed, as those six include several
shorthand properties. In the case of `all`, there will be at least 19
`transitionend`{.keep-together} events: one for each of the longhand
values making up the six properties we know are included in the pre- and
post-transition states, and possibly from others that are inherited or
declared in other style blocks impacting the element.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"

You can listen for `transitionend` events like this:

``` {code-language="js" data-type="programlisting"}
document.querySelector("div").addEventListener("transitionend",
    , (e) => {
      console.log(e.propertyName);
});
```

The `transitionend` event includes three
[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797014751728 primary="attributes"
secondary="event-specific"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797014750816
primary="event-specific attributes" data-type="indexterm"}event-specific
attributes:

`propertyName`

:   The name of the CSS property that just finished transitioning.

`pseudoElement`

:   The pseudo-element upon which the transition occurred, preceded by
    two semicolons, or an empty string if the transition was on a
    regular DOM node.

`elapsedTime`

:   The amount of time the transition took [to run,]{.keep-together} in
    seconds; usually this is the time listed in the
    `transition-duration` property.

A `transitionend` event will occur for each property that successfully
transitions to a new value. It will not fire if the transition is
interrupted, such as by removing the state change that initiated the
transition or by another change to the same property on the same
element. That said, a `transitionend` event *will* occur when it reverts
back to its initial value, or when it finishes transitioning to the
value made by that other property value change on the element.

When the properties return to their initial value, another
`transitionend` event occurs. This event occurs as long as the
transition started, even if it didn't finish its initial transition in
the original direction.[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797014705728 primary=""

```
When moving between two states, if a duration is declared for only one
of those states, the transition duration will be used for only the
transition *to* that state. Consider the [following]{.keep-together}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
input {
    transition: background-color;
}
input:invalid {
    transition-duration: 1s;
    background-color: red;
}
input:valid {
    transition-duration: 0.2s;
    background-color: green;
}
```

Thus, it will take 1 second for the input to change to a red background
when it becomes invalid, and only 200 milliseconds to transition to a
green background when it becomes valid.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/18-transitions/transition-duration-revert-difference.xhtml){.play}

The value of the `transition-duration` property is positive in either
seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`). The time unit of `ms` or `s` is
required by the specification, even if the duration is set to `0s`. By
default, properties change from one value to the next instantly, showing
no visible animation, which is why the default value for the duration of
a transition is `0s`.

Unless a positive value for `transition-delay` is set on a property, if
`transition-duration` is omitted, it is as if no `transition-property`
declaration had been applied, and no `transitionend` event will occur.
As long as the total duration time for a transition is greater than 0
seconds---as long as the `transition-duration` is greater than the
`transition-delay`, including greater than the default `0s` delay---the
transition will still be applied, and a `transitionend` event will occur
when the transition finishes.

Negative values for `transition-duration` are invalid, and, if included,
will invalidate the entire `transition-duration` declaration.

Using the same lengthy `transition-property` declaration from before, we
can declare a single duration for all the properties, individual
durations for each property, or we can make alternate properties animate
for the same length of time. We can declare a [single]{.keep-together}
duration that applies to all properties during the transition by
including a single `transition-duration` value:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
 div {
    color: #ff0000;
    …
    transition-property: color, border, border-radius, opacity,
        width, padding;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
}
```

We can also declare the same number of comma-separated time values for
the `transition-duration` property value as the CSS properties listed in
the `transition-property` property value. If we want each property to
transition over a different length of time, we have to include a
different comma-separated value for each property name declared:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    color: #ff0000;
    …
    transition-property: color, border, border-radius, opacity,
        width, padding;
    transition-duration: 200ms, 180ms, 160ms, 120ms, 1s, 2s;
}
```

If the number of properties declared does not match the number of
durations declared, the browser has specific rules on how to handle the
mismatch. If we have more durations than properties, the extra durations
are ignored. If we have more properties than durations, the durations
are repeated. In the following example, `color`, `border-radius`, and
`width` have a duration of 100 milliseconds; `border`, `opacity`, and
`padding` will be set to 200 milliseconds:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    …
    transition-property: color, border, border-radius, opacity,
        width, padding;
    transition-duration: 100ms, 200ms;
}
```

If we declare exactly two comma-separated durations, every odd property
will transition over the first time declared, and every even property
will transition over the second time value declared.

###### Tip {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1703}

Always remember that user experience is important. If a transition is
too slow, the website will appear slow or unresponsive, drawing unwanted
focus to what should be a subtle effect. If a transition is too fast, it
may be too subtle to be noticed. Visual effects should last long enough
to be seen, but not so long as to make themselves the center of
attention. Generally, the best duration for a visible, yet not
distracting, transition is 100 to 300
milliseconds.[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797014425760 primary=""

### Cubic Bézier timing {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1706}

primary="Bézier curve functions" data-type="indexterm"}nonstep keywords
are easing timing functions that serve as aliases for cubic Bézier
mathematical functions that provide smooth curves. The specification
provides for five predefined easing functions, as shown in
[Table 18-1](#ch18.xhtml_cubic_bezier){data-type="xref"}.

Cubic Bézier curves, including the underlying curves defining the five
named easing functions in
[Table 18-1](#ch18.xhtml_cubic_bezier){data-type="xref"} and displayed
in [Figure 18-3](#ch18.xhtml_tr_fig0203){data-type="xref"}, take four
numeric parameters. For example, `linear` is the same as
`cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1)`. The first and third cubic Bézier function
parameter values need to be between 0 and 1.

The four numbers in a `cubic-bezier()` function define the *x* and *y*
coordinates of two *handles* within a box. These handles are the
endpoints of lines that stretch from the bottom-left and top-right
corners of the box. The curve is constructed using the two corners, and
the two handles' coordinates, via a Bézier function.

To get an idea of how this works, look at the curves and their
corresponding values shown in
[Figure 18-4](#ch18.xhtml_taic_css4_cubic-bezier-coordinates){data-type="xref"}.

</div>
</figure>

Consider the first example. The first two values, corresponding to *x1*
and *y1*, are `0.5` and `1`. If you go halfway across the box (*x1* =
0.5) and all the way to the top of the box (*y1* = 1), you land at the
spot where the first handle is placed. Similarly, the coordinates
`0.5,0` for *x2,y2* describe the point at the center bottom of the box,
which is where the second handle is placed. The curve shown there
results from those handle placements.

In the second example, the handle positions are switched, with the
resulting change in the curve. Ditto for the third and fourth examples,
which are inversions of each other. Notice how the resulting curve
differs when switching the handle positions.

The predefined key terms are fairly limited. To better follow the
principles of animation, you may want to use a cubic Bézier function
with four float values instead of the predefined key words. If you're a
whiz at calculus or have a lot of experience with programs like
Illustrator, you might be able to invent cubic Bézier functions in your
head; otherwise, online tools let you play with different values, such
as [*http://cubic-bezier.com*](http://cubic-bezier.com){.bare}, which
lets you compare the common keywords against each other or against your
own cubic [Bézier function.]{.keep-together}

As shown in [Figure 18-5](#ch18.xhtml_tr_fig0204){data-type="xref"}, the
website [*http://easings.net*](http://easings.net){.bare} provides many
additional cubic Bézier function values you can use to provide for a
more realistic, delightful animation.

  `steps(<integer>, jump-start)`   Displays \<*`integer`*\> keyframes, showing the last keyframe for the last *n*/100% of the transition duration; the first jump happens at the very beginning of the transition. `start` can be used in place of `jump-start`
  `steps(<integer>, jump-end)`     Displays \<*`integer`*\> keyframes, staying on the initial state for the first *n*/100% of the transition duration; the last jump happens at the very end of the transition. `end` can be used in place of `jump-end`
  `steps(<integer>, jump-both)`    Displays \<*`integer`*\> keyframes, starting with an immediate jump and taking the final jump at the very end of the transition duration; this effectively adds one step to the transition
  `steps(<integer>, jump-none)`    Displays \<*`integer`*\> keyframes, but there is no jump at either the beginning or end of the transition duration, instead staying on the initial values for the first *n*/100% of the time *and* showing the final values for the last *n*/100% of the time; this effectively removes one step from the transition
  `step-start`                     Stays on the final keyframe throughout transition duration; equal to `steps(1, jump-start)`
  `step-end`                       Stays on the initial keyframe throughout transition duration; equal to `steps(1, jump-end)`

As [Figure 18-6](#ch18.xhtml_steptiming){data-type="xref"} shows, the
step timing functions show the progression of the transition from the
initial value to the final value in steps, rather than as a smooth
curve.

The step timing functions allow you to divide the transition over
equidistant steps, by defining the number and direction of steps.

With `jump-start`, the first step happens at the animation or transition
start. With `jump-end`, the last step happens at the animation or
transition end. For example, `steps(5, jump-end)` would jump through the
equidistant steps at 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%; and
`steps(5, jump-start)` would jump through the equidistant steps at 20%,
40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.

The `step-start` function is the same as `steps(1, jump-start)`. When
used, transitioned property values stay on their *final* values from the
beginning until the end of the [transition.]{.keep-together} The
`step-end` function, which is the same as `steps(1, jump-end)`, sets
transitioned values to their *initial* values, staying there throughout
the transition's duration.

###### Note {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1712}

Step timing, especially the precise meaning of `jump-start` and
`jump-end`, is discussed in depth in
[Chapter 19](../Text/ch19.xhtml#animation){data-type="xref"}.
:::

Continuing on with the same lengthy `transition-property` declaration
we've used before, we can declare a single timing function for all the
properties, or define individual timing functions for each property, and
so on. Here, we've set all the transitioned properties to a single
duration and timing function:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    transition-property: color, border-width, border-color, border-radius,
        opacity, width, padding;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in;
}
```

Always remember that the `transition-timing-function` does not change
the time it takes to transition properties: that is set with the
`transition-duration` property. It just changes how the transition
progresses during that set time. Consider the
[following:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    …
    transition-property: color, border-width, border-color, border-radius,
        opacity, width, padding;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out,
        step-end, step-start, steps(5, jump-start), steps(3, jump-end);
}
```

If we include these seven timing functions for the seven properties, as
long as they have the same transition duration and delay, all the
properties start and finish transitioning at the same time. (The
preceding transition would be a terrible user experience, by the way.
Please don't do that.)

The best way to familiarize yourself with the various timing functions
is to play with them and see which one works best for the effect you're
looking for. While testing, set a relatively long `transition-duration`
to better visualize the difference between the various functions. At
higher speeds, you may not be able to tell the difference between
different easing functions. Just don't forget to set the transition back
to a faster speed before publishing the

## Delaying Transitions {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1713}

The `transition-delay` property[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_transition_delay2
primary="transitions" secondary="delaying"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_transition_delay
primary="transition-delay property" data-type="indexterm"} enables you
to introduce a delay between the time that the change initiating the
transition is applied to an element and the time the transition actually
begins.

</aside>
```
A `transition-delay` of `0s` (the default) means the transition will
begin immediately; it will start executing as soon as the state of the
element is altered. This is familiar from the instant-change effect of
`a:hover`, for example.

With a value other than `0s`, the \<*`time`*\> value of
`transition-delay` defines the time offset from the moment the property
values would ordinarily have changed until the property values declared
in the `transition` or `transition-property` values begin animating to
their final values.

Interestingly, negative values of time are valid. The effects you can
create with negative `transition-delay`s are described in ["Negative
delay values"](#ch18.xhtml_negative-delay-values){data-type="xref"}.

Continuing with the 6- (or 19-) property `transition-property`
declaration we've been using, we [can make]{.keep-together} all the
properties start transitioning right away by omitting the
`transition-delay` property, or by including it with a value of `0s`.
Another possibility is to start half the transitions right away, and the
rest 200 milliseconds later, as in the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    transition-property: color, border, border-radius, opacity,
        width, padding;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
    transition-delay: 0s, 200ms;
}
```

By including `transition-delay: 0s, 200ms` on a series of properties,
each taking 200 milliseconds to transition, we make `color`,
`border-radius`, and `width` begin their transitions immediately. All
the rest begin their transitions as soon as the other transitions have
completed, because their `transition-delay` is equal to the
`transition-duration` applied to all the properties.

As with `transition-duration` and `transition-timing-function`, when the
comma-separated `transition-delay` values outnumber the comma-separated
`transition-property` values, the extra delay values are ignored. When
the comma-separated `transition-property` values outnumber the
comma-separated `transition-delay` values, the delay values are
repeated.

We can even declare seven `transition-delay` values so that each
property begins transitioning after the previous property has
transitioned, as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    …
    transition-property: color, border-width, border-color, border-radius,
        opacity, width, padding;
    transition-duration: 200ms;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
    transition-delay: 0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s, 0.8s, 1s, 1.2s;
}
```

In this example, we declare each transition to last 200 milliseconds
with the `transition-duration` property. We then declare a
`transition-delay` that provides comma-separated delay values for each
property that increments by 200 milliseconds, or 0.2 seconds---the same
time as the duration of each property's transition. The end result is
that each property starts transitioning at the point the previous
property has finished.

We can use math to give every transitioning property different durations
and delays, ensuring that they all complete transitioning at the same
time:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    …
    transition-property: color, border-width, border-color, border-radius,
        opacity, width, padding;
    transition-duration: 1.4s, 1.2s, 1s, 0.8s, 0.6s, 0.4s, 0.2s;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
    transition-delay: 0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s, 0.8s, 1s, 1.2s;
}
```

In this example, each property completes transitioning at the 1.4-second
mark, but each with a different duration and delay. For each property,
the `transition-duration` value plus the `transition-delay` value will
add up to 1.4 seconds.

Generally, you'll want all the transitions to begin at the same time.
You can make that happen by including a single `transition-delay` value,
which gets applied to all the properties. In our drop-down menu in
[Figure 18-1](#ch18.xhtml_tr_fig01){data-type="xref"}, we included a
delay of 50 milliseconds. This delay is not long enough for the user to
notice and will not cause the application to appear slow. Rather, a
50-millisecond delay can help prevent the navigation from shooting open
unintentionally as the user accidentally hovers over the menu items
while moving the cursor from one part of the page or app to another, or
as they quickly move the focus ring through the document.

### Negative delay values {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1715}

A []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013817392
primary="negative delay values, transition delays"
data-type="indexterm"}negative value for `transition-delay` that is
smaller than the `transition-duration` will cause the transition to
start immediately, partway through the transition. For
[example]{.keep-together}:
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/18-transitions/transition-delay-negative.xhtml){.play}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
  transform: translateX(0);
  transition-property: transform;
  transition-duration: 200ms;
  transition-delay: -150ms;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
div:hover {
  transform: translateX(200px);
}
```

Given the `transition-delay` of `-150ms` on a `200ms` transition, the
transition will start three-quarters of the way through the transition
and will last 50 milliseconds. In that scenario, given the linear timing
function, the `<div>` jumps to being translated `150px` along the x-axis
immediately on hover and then animates the translation from 150 pixels
to 200 pixels over 50 milliseconds.

If the absolute value of the negative `transition-delay` is greater than
or equal to the `transition-duration`, the change of property values is
immediate, as if no `transition` had been applied, *and* no
`transitionend`{.keep-together} event occurs.

When transitioning back from the hovered state to the original state, by
default, the same value for the `transition-delay` is applied. In the
preceding scenario, since the `transition-delay` is not overridden in
the hover state, when the user stops hovering over the element, the
`<div>` will jump to being translated 50 pixels along the x-axis and
then take 50 milliseconds to return to its initial position of being
translated 0 pixels along the x-axis.[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013755728

The `transition` property accepts the value of `none`, or any number of
comma-separated list of *single transitions*. A single transition
contains a single property to transition, or the keyword `all` to
transition all the properties; the duration of the transition; the
timing function; and the transition delay.

If a single transition within the `transition` shorthand omits the
property to transition, that single transition will default to `all`. If
the `transition-timing-function` value is omitted, it will default to
`ease`. If only one time value is included, that will be the duration,
and no delay will occur, as if `transition-delay` were set to `0s`.

Within each single transition, the order of the duration versus the
delay is important: the first value that can be parsed as a time will be
set as the duration. If an additional time value is found before the
comma or the end of the statement, that will be set as the delay.

Here are three equivalent ways to write the same transition effects:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav li ul {
    transition: transform 200ms ease-in 50ms,
                  opacity 200ms ease-in 50ms;
}
nav li ul {
    transition: all 200ms ease-in 50ms;
}
nav li ul {
    transition: 200ms ease-in 50ms;
}
```

In the first example, we see a shorthand way to express each of the two
properties that are being transitioned. Because we are transitioning all
the properties that will be changed (in other rules not shown in the
code block), we could use the keyword `all`, as shown in the second
example. And, since `all` is the default value, we could write the
shorthand with just the duration, timing function, and delay. Had we
used `ease` instead of `ease-in`, we could have omitted the timing
function, since `ease` is the default. Had we not wanted a delay, we
could have omitted the second time value, since `0s` is the default.

We did have to include the duration, or no transition would be visible.
In other words, the only portion of the `transition` property value that
can truly be considered required is `transition-duration`.

If we wanted to only delay the change from closed menu to open menu
without a gradual transition, we would still need to include a duration
of `0s`. Remember, the first value parsable as time will be set as the
duration and the second one will be set as the delay:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav li ul {
  transition: 0s 200ms;
}
```

###### Warning {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1718}

This transition will wait 200 milliseconds, then show the drop-down
fully open and opaque with no gradual transition. Creating delays with
no transitions is a horrible user experience, so please do not do it.
:::

If we have a comma-separated list of transitions (versus just a single
declaration) and the word `none` is included, the entire transition
declaration is invalid and will be ignored. You can declare
comma-separated values for the four longhand transition properties, or
you can include a comma-separated list of multiple shorthand
transitions:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    transition-property: color, border-width, border-color, border-radius,
        opacity, width, padding;
    transition-duration: 200ms, 180ms, 160ms, 140ms, 100ms, 2s, 3s;
    transition-timing-function: ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out,
        step-end, steps(5, start), steps(3, end);
    transition-delay: 0s, 0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s, 0.8s, 1s, 1.2s;
}
div {
    transition:
        color 200ms ease,
        border-width 180ms ease-in 200ms,
        border-color 160ms ease-out 400ms,
        border-radius 140ms ease-in-out 600ms,
        opacity 100ms step-end 0.8s,
        width 2s steps(5, start) 1s,
        padding 3s steps(3, end) 1.2s;
}
```

The two preceding CSS rule blocks are functionally equivalent. Use care
when stringing multiple shorthand transitions into a list of
transitions: `transition: color, opacity 200ms ease-in 50ms` will ease
in the opacity over 200 milliseconds after a 50-millisecond delay, but
the `color` change will be instantaneous, with no `transitionend` event.
It is still valid, but may not be the effect you were
seeking.[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013506464 primary=""

## Reversing Interrupted Transitions {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1719}

When a []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013371504 primary="transitions"
secondary="reversing interrupted"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013370528
primary="transitions" secondary="timing of"
data-type="indexterm"}transition is interrupted before it is able to
finish (such as mousing off a drop-down menu before it finishes its
opening transition), property values are reset to the values they had
before the transition began, and the properties transition back to those
values. Because repeating the duration and timing functions on a
reverting partial transition can lead to an odd or even bad user
experience, the CSS Transitions specification provides for making the
reverting transition shorter.

Let's say we have a `transition-delay` of `50ms` set on the default
state of a menu, and no transition properties declared on the hover
state; thus, browsers will wait 50 milliseconds before beginning the
reverse (or closing) transition.

When the forward animation finishes transitioning to the final values
and the `transitionend`{.keep-together} event is fired, all browsers
will duplicate the `transition-delay` in the reverse states. Let's say
the user moves off that menu 75 milliseconds after it started
transitioning. This means the drop-down menu will animate closed without
ever being fully opened and fully opaque. The browser should have a
50-millisecond delay before closing the menu, just as it waited 50
milliseconds before starting to open it. This is actually a good user
experience, as it provides a few milliseconds of delay before closing,
preventing jerky behavior if the user accidentally navigates off the
menu.

In the case of a step timing function, if the transition is 10 seconds
with 10 steps, and the properties revert after 3.25 seconds, ending a
quarter of the way between the third and fourth steps (completing three
steps, or 30% of the transition), it will take 3 seconds to revert to
the previous values. In the following example, the width of our `<div>`
will grow to 130 pixels wide before it begins reverting back to 100
pixels wide on mouseout:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    width: 100px;
    transition: width 10s steps(10, jump-start);
}
div:hover {
    width: 200px;
}
```

While the []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013344864 primary="transitions"
secondary="duration" data-type="indexterm"}reverse duration will be
rounded down to the time it took to reach the most recently executed
step, the reverse *direction* will be split by the originally declared
number of steps, not the number of steps that completed. In our
3.25-second case, it will take [3 seconds]{.keep-together} to revert
through 10 steps. These reverse transition steps will be shorter in
duration at 300 milliseconds each, each step shrinking the width by 3
pixels, instead of [10 pixels.]{.keep-together}

If the timing function is linear, the duration will be the same in both
directions. All other `cubic-bezier` functions will have a
[duration]{.keep-together} that is proportional to progress the initial
transition made before being interrupted. Negative `transition-delay`
values are also proportionally shortened. Positive delays remain
unchanged in both directions.

No browser will have a `transitionend` for the hover state, as the
transition did not end; but all browsers will have a `transitionend`
event in the reverse state when the menu finishes collapsing. The
`elapsedTime` for that reverse transition depends on whether the browser
took the full 200 milliseconds to close the menu, or if the browser
takes as long to close the menu as it did to partially open the menu.

To override these values, include transition properties in both the
initial and final states (e.g., both the unhovered and hovered styles).
While this does not impact the reverse shortening, it does provide more
control.

# Animatable Properties and Values {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1721}

Before []{#ch18.xhtml_ix_prop_animatable primary="properties"
secondary="animatable"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_animatable_prop
primary="animatable properties" data-type="indexterm"}implementing
transitions and animations, it's important to understand that not all
properties are animatable. You can transition (or animate) any
animatable CSS properties; but which properties are animatable?

One []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013295984
primary="interpolation, transitions" data-type="indexterm"}key to
developing a sense for which properties can be animated is to identify
which have values that can be interpolated. *Interpolation* is the
construction of data points between the values of known data points.
[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013294768 primary="computed value"
data-type="indexterm"}The key guideline to determining if a property
value is animatable is whether the *computed value* can be interpolated.
If a property's computed values are keywords, they can't be
interpolated; if its keywords compute to a number of some sort, they can
be. The quick gut check is that if you can determine a midpoint between
two property values, those property values are probably animatable.

For example, []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013292912 primary="display property"
secondary="animatability" data-type="indexterm"}the `display` values
like `block` and `inline-block` aren't numeric and therefore don't have
a midpoint; they aren't animatable. The `transform` property values of
`rotate(10deg)` and `rotate(20deg)` have a midpoint of `rotate(15deg)`;
they are [animatable.]{.keep-together}

The `border` property[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013286992
primary="border property" secondary="animatability"
data-type="indexterm"} is shorthand for `border-style`, `border-width`,
and `border-color` (which, in turn, are themselves shorthand properties
for the four side values). While there is no midpoint between any of the
`border-style` values, the `border-width` property length units are
numeric, so they can be animated. The keyword values of `medium`,
`thick`, and `thin` have numeric equivalents and can be interpolated:
the computed value of the `border-width` property translates those
keywords to lengths.

In the `border-color` value, colors are numeric---the named colors can
all be represented using hexadecimal or other numeric color values---so
colors are animatable as well. If you transition from
`border: red solid 3px` to `border: blue dashed 10px`, the border width
and border colors will transition at the defined speed, but
`border-style` will jump from `solid` to `dashed` immediately.

In the same vein, CSS []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013278528
primary="visibility property" secondary="animatability"
data-type="indexterm"}functions that take numeric values as parameters
generally are animatable. An exception to this rule is properties with
discrete animation types like `visibility`{.keep-together}: while there
is no midpoint between the values of `visible` and `hidden`,
`visibility`{.keep-together} values jump between the discrete values,
jumping from visible to not visible. With the `visibility` property,
when the initial value or the destination value is `visible`, the value
will change at the end of the transition from `visible` to `hidden`. For
a transition from `hidden` to `visible`, the value changes at the start
of the transition.

The `auto` value should generally be considered nonanimatable and should
be avoided for animations and transitions. According to the
specification, it is not an animatable value, but some browsers
interpolate the current numeric value of `auto` (such as `height: auto`)
to be `0px` or possibly a `fit-content()` function. The `auto` value is
nonanimatable for properties like `height`, `width`, `top`, `bottom`,
`left`, `right`, and `margin`.

Often an alternative property or value may work. For example, instead of
changing `height: 0` to `height: auto`, use `max-height: 0` to
`max-height: 100vh`, which will generally create the expected effect.
The `auto` value is animatable for `min-height` and `min-width`, since
`min-height: auto` actually computes to 0.

::: {#ch18.xhtml_how-property-values-are-interpolated .sect2}
## How Property Values Are Interpolated {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1722}

Numbers are []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013259824 primary="transitions"
secondary="animatable properties for"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_value_interpol primary="values"
secondary="interpolated"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_ix_interpol_transition
primary="interpolation, transitions" data-type="indexterm"}interpolated
as floating-point numbers. Integers are interpolated as whole numbers,
and thus increment or decrement as whole numbers.

In CSS, length and percentage units are translated into real numbers.
When transitioning or animating `calc()`, from one type of length to or
from a percentage, the values will be converted into a `calc()` function
and interpolated as real numbers.

Colors, []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013254592 primary="colors"
secondary="in transitions" secondary-sortas="transitions"
data-type="indexterm"}whether they are HSLA, RGB, or named colors like
`aliceblue`, are translated to their RGBA equivalent values for
transitioning, and interpolated across the RGBA color space. If you want
to interpolate across a different color space, such as HSL, ensure the
pre- and post-transition colors are in the same color space (in this
case, HSL).

When animating font weights, if you use keywords like `bold`, they'll be
converted to numeric values and animated.

When including animatable property values that have more than one
component, each component is interpolated appropriately for that
component. For example, `text-shadow` has up to four components: the
color, `x`, `y`, and `blur`. The color is interpolated as `color`,
whereas the `x`, `y`, and `blur` components are interpolated as lengths.

Box []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013247008 primary="shadows"
secondary="box-shadow property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013246032
primary="text shadows, transitions"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013245360
primary="box-shadow property" data-type="indexterm"}shadows have two
additional optional keywords: `inset` (or lack thereof) and `spread`.
Because `spread` is a length, it is interpolated. The `inset` keyword
cannot be converted to a numeric equivalent, so there is no way to
gradually transition between inset and drop shadows.

Similar to []{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013242512 primary="gradients"
secondary="in transitions" secondary-sortas="transitions"
data-type="indexterm"}values with more than one component, gradients can
be transitioned only if you are transitioning gradients of the same type
(linear, radial, or conic) with equal numbers of color stops. The colors
of each color stop are then interpolated as colors, and the position of
each color stop is interpolated as length and percentage units.

:::: {#ch18.xhtml_idm45797013240976 .sect2}
## Interpolating Repeating Values {#ch18.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1723}

When you have simple lists of other types of properties, each item in
the list is interpolated appropriately for that type---as long as the
lists have the same number of items or repeatable items, and each pair
of values can be interpolated. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.img {
    background-image:
        url(1.gif), url(2.gif), url(3.gif), url(4.gif),
        url(5.gif), url(6.gif), url(7.gif), url(8.gif),
        url(9.gif), url(10.gif), url(11.gif), url(12.gif);
    transition: background-size 1s ease-in 0s;
    background-size: 10px 10px, 20px 20px, 30px 30px, 40px 40px;
}
.img:hover {
    background-size: 25px 25px, 50px 50px, 75px 75px, 100px 100px;
}
```

In transitioning four `background-sizes`, with all the sizes in both
lists listed in pixels, the third `background-size` from the
pretransitioned state can gradually transition to the third
`background-size` of the transitioned list. In the preceding example,
background images 1, 5, and 9 will transition from `10px` to `25px` in
height and width when hovered. Similarly, images 3, 7, and 11 will
transition from `30px` to `75px`, and so forth.

Thus, the `background-size` values are repeated three times, as if the
CSS had been written as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.img {
    …
    background-size: 10px 10px, 20px 20px, 30px 30px, 40px 40px,
                     10px 10px, 20px 20px, 30px 30px, 40px 40px,
                     10px 10px, 20px 20px, 30px 30px, 40px 40px;
    …
}
.img:hover {
    background-size: 25px 25px, 50px 50px, 75px 75px, 100px 100px,
                     25px 25px, 50px 50px, 75px 75px, 100px 100px,
                     25px 25px, 50px 50px, 75px 75px, 100px 100px;
}
```

If a property doesn't have enough comma-separated values to match the
number of background images, the list of values is repeated until there
are enough, even when the list in the animated state doesn't match the
initial state:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.img:hover {
    background-size: 33px 33px, 66px 66px, 99px 99px;
}
```

If we transition from four `background-size` declarations in the initial
state to three `background-size` declarations in the animated state, all
in pixels and still with 12 background images, the animated and initial
state values are repeated (three and four times, respectively) until we
have the 12 necessary values, as if the following had been declared:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.img {
    …
    background-size: 10px 10px, 20px 20px, 30px 30px,
                     40px 40px, 10px 10px, 20px 20px,
                     30px 30px, 40px 40px, 10px 10px,
                     20px 20px, 30px 30px, 40px 40px;
    …
}
.img:hover {
    background-size: 33px 33px, 66px 66px, 99px 99px,
                     33px 33px, 66px 66px, 99px 99px,
                     33px 33px, 66px 66px, 99px 99px,
                     33px 33px, 66px 66px, 99px 99px;
}
```

If a pair of values cannot be interpolated---for example, if the
`background-size` changes from `contain` in the default state to `cover`
when hovered---then, according to the specification, the lists are not
interpolatable. However, some browsers ignore that particular pair of
values for the purposes of the transition, and still animate the
interpolatable values.

Some property values can animate if the browser can infer implicit
[values.]{.keep-together} For example, for shadows, the browser will
infer an implicit shadow `box-shadow: transparent 0 0 0` or
`box-shadow: inset transparent 0 0 0`, replacing any values not
explicitly included in the pre- or post-transition state. These examples
are in the [chapter files for this
book](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs).

Only animatable property value changes trigger `transitionend` events.

If you accidentally include a property that can't be transitioned, fear
not. The entire [declaration]{.keep-together} will not fail: the browser
will simply not transition the property that is not animatable.

Note that a nonanimatable property or nonexistent CSS property is not
exactly ignored. The browser passes over unrecognized or nonanimatable
properties, keeping their place in the property list order to ensure
that the other comma-separated transition properties described next are
not applied to the wrong
properties.^[1](../Text/ch18.xhtml#idm45797038809616){#ch18.xhtml_idm45797038809616-marker

element is printed, either [the interpolating]{.keep-together} values
are ignored or the property values in their current state [are
printed.]{.keep-together}

You can't see the element transitioning on a piece of paper, but in some
browsers, like Chrome, if an element transitioned from one state to
another, the current state at the time the `print` function is called
will be the value on the printed page, if that property is printable.
For example, if a background color changed, neither the pre-transition
or the post-transition background color will be printed, as background
colors are generally not printed. However, if the text color mutated
from one value to another, the current value of `color` will get printed
on a color printer or to a PDF.

In other browsers, like Firefox, whether the pre-transition or
post-transition value is printed depends on how the transition was
initiated. If it's initiated with a hover, for example, the nonhovered
value will be printed, as you are no longer hovering over the element
while you interact with the print dialog. If it transitioned with a
class addition, the post-transition value will be printed, even if the
transition hasn't completed. The printing acts as if the transition
properties are ignored.

Given that CSS has separate print stylesheets or `@media` rules for
print, browsers compute style separately. In the print style, styles
don't change, so there just aren't any transitions. The printing acts as
if the property values changed instantly instead of transitioning over
time.

Transitions are a useful and quite powerful way to add UI enhancements.
Worrying about archaic browsers should not prevent you from including
them, since if a browser doesn't support CSS transitions, the changes
will still be applied. They'll just "transition" from the initial state
to the end state instantaneously when the style recomputation occurs. A
user may miss out on an interesting (or possibly annoying) effect, but
will not miss out on any content.[]{#ch18.xhtml_idm45797038764448
primary="" startref="ix_transition_ch18" data-type="indexterm"}

The defining feature of transitions is that they are applied when an
element transitions from one state to another, whether that happens
because of user action or some kind of scripted change to the DOM. If
you want elements to animate regardless of user action or DOM changes,
the next chapter will show you the way.

The CSS Working Group is considering making all property values
animatable, switching from one value to the next at the midpoint of the
timing function if there is no midpoint between the pre and post values.

# [Chapter 19. ]{.label}Animation

CSS []{#ch19.xhtml_ix_animation_ch19 primary="animation"
data-type="indexterm"}transitions, covered in the previous chapter,
enable simple animations that are triggered by changes in the DOM state
and proceed from a beginning state to an end state. CSS *animations* are
similar to transitions in that values of CSS properties change over
time, but animations provide much more control over the way those
changes happen. Specifically, CSS keyframe animations let us decide if
and how an animation repeats, give us granular control over what happens
throughout the animation, and more. While transitions trigger implicit
property value changes, animations are explicitly executed when keyframe
animations are applied.

With CSS animations, you can change property values that are not part of
the set pre- or post-state of an element. The property values set on the
animated element don't necessarily have to be part of the animation
progression. For example, when using a transition, going from black to
white will animate only through various shades of gray. With animation,
that same element doesn't have to be black or white or even in-between
shades of gray during the animation.

While you *can* transition through shades of gray, you could instead
turn the element yellow, then animate from yellow to orange.
Alternatively, you could animate through various colors, starting with
black and ending with white, but progressing through the entire rainbow
along the way.

*repeated rapid changing of content can lead to seizures in some users.*
Always keep this in mind, and ensure the accessibility of your website
for people with epilepsy and other seizure disorders.
:::

We don't usually start a chapter with a warning, but in this case, it's
warranted. Visual change, especially rapid visual change, can trigger
medical emergencies in users who are prone to seizures. They can also
cause severe unease in users who are prone to vestibular disorder
(motion sickness).

To reduce or eliminate this risk, use the `prefers-reduced-motion` media
query (see
[Chapter 21](../Text/ch21.xhtml#css-at-rules){data-type="xref"}).
[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797038747568 primary="media queries (@media)"

primary="prefers-reduced-motion media query"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797038745600
primary="reduced-motion animations" data-type="indexterm"}This allows
you to apply styles when the user has a "Reduce motion" or similar
preference set for their browser or operating system. An approach such
as this may be considered:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
  * {animation: none !important; transition: none !important;}
}
```

This disables all animations and transitions, assuming no other
`!important` animations are specified (and they shouldn't be). This is
not a nuanced or perfect solution, but it's a first step. You can invert
this approach by segregating all of your animations and transitions in a
media block for those who do *not* have motion reduction enabled, like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media not (prefers-reduced-motion) {
  /* all animations and transitions */
}
```

Not all animations are dangerous or disorienting, and having at least
some animations for all users may be necessary. Transitions and
animations can be very helpful in informing users what has changed and
guiding them to focus on specific content. In such cases, use
`prefers-reduced-motion` to tone down animations that are essential to
understanding the UI, and to switch off those that are not essential.

of a keyframe animation; to do *that*, we need a named keyframe
animation. The first step is to define this reusable CSS keyframe
animation by using the `@keyframes` at-rule, thus giving our animation a
name.

A `@keyframes` at-rule []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797038646960
primary="animation" secondary="animation identifier"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_block_keyframe_anim

primary="keyframes" secondary="keyframe blocks"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_keyframe_name
primary="keyframes" secondary="naming" data-type="indexterm"}includes
the *animation identifier*, or name, and one or more *keyframe blocks*.
Each keyframe block includes one or more keyframe selectors with
declaration blocks of property-value pairs. The entire `@keyframes`
at-rule specifies the behavior of a single full iteration of the
animation. The animation can iterate zero or more times, depending
mainly on the `animation-iteration-count` property value, which we'll
discuss in ["Declaring Animation
Iterations"](#ch19.xhtml_defining-animation-iterations){data-type="xref"}.

Each []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797038639408 primary="keyframes"
secondary="selectors, including to and from"
data-type="indexterm"}keyframe block includes one or more *keyframe
selectors*. These are percentage-of-time positions along the duration of
the animation; they are declared either as percentages or with the
keywords `from` or `to`. Here's the generic structure of an animation:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes animation_identifier {
  keyframe_selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
  }
  keyframe_selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
  }
}
```

Here are a couple of basic examples:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes fadeout {
    from {
        opacity: 1;
    }
    to {
        opacity: 0;
    }
}

@keyframes color-pop {
    0% {
        color: black;
        background-color: white;
    }
    33% { /* one-third of the way through the animation */
        color: gray;
        background-color: yellow;
    }
    100% {
        color: white;
        background-color: orange;
    }
}
```

The first set of keyframes shown takes an element, sets its `opacity` to
`1` (fully opaque), and animates it to `0` opacity (fully transparent).
The second keyframe set animates an element's foreground to black and
its background to white, then animates the foreground from black to gray
and then white, and the background from white to yellow and then orange.

Note that the keyframes don't say how long this animation should
take---that's handled by a CSS property dedicated to the purpose.
Instead they say, "Go from this state to that state" or "Hit these
various states at these percentage points of the total animation."
That's why keyframe selectors are always percentages, or `from` and
`to`. If you try to use time values (like `1.5s`) as your keyframe
selectors, you'll render them invalid.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797038513168

primary="curly braces ({…​})" secondary="keyframes"
data-type="indexterm"}opening and closing curly braces of a keyframe
set, you include a series of keyframe selectors with blocks of CSS that
declare the properties you want to animate. Once the keyframes are
defined, you "attach" the animation to an element by using the
`animation-name` property. We'll discuss that property shortly, in
["Invoking a Named
Animation"](#ch19.xhtml_the-animation-name-property){data-type="xref"}.

Start with the at-rule declaration, followed by the animation name and
braces:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes nameOfAnimation {
...
}
```

The []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797038468656 primary="animation"
secondary="animation identifier" data-type="indexterm"}name, which you
create, is an identifier or a string. Originally, the keyframe names had
to be an identifier, but both the specification and the browsers also
support quoted strings.

Identifiers are unquoted and have specific rules. You can use any
characters `a-z`, `A-Z`, and `0-9`, the hyphen (`-`), underscore (`_`),
and any ISO 10646 character U+00A0 and higher. ISO 10646 is the
universal character set; this means you can use any character in the
Unicode standard that matches the regular expression
`[-_a-zA-Z0-9\u00A0-\u10FFFF]`.[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/name.xhtml){.play}
The identifier can't start with a digit (0--9) and should not start with
two hyphens (though some browsers allow this). One hyphen is fine, as
long as it is not followed by a digit---unless you escape the digit or
hyphen with a backslash.

If you include any escape characters within your animation name, make
sure to escape them with a backslash (`\`). For example, `Q&A!` must be
written as `Q\&A\!`. The name `âœŽ` can be left as `âœŽ` (no, that's not
a typo), and `✎` is a valid name as well. But if you're going to use any
keyboard characters that aren't letters or digits in an identifier, like
`!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, and so on, escape them with a backslash.

Also, don't use any of the keywords covered in this chapter as the name
of your animation. For example, possible values for the various
animation properties we'll be covering later in the chapter include
`none`, `paused`, `running`, `infinite`, `backwards`, and `forwards`.
Using an animation property keyword, while not prohibited by the spec,
will likely break your animation
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/badnames.xhtml){.play}
when using the `animation` shorthand property (discussed in ["Bringing
It All
Together"](#ch19.xhtml_the-animation-shorthand-property){data-type="xref"}).
So, while you can legally name your animation `paused` (or another
keyword,) we *strongly* recommend against it.

# Defining Keyframe Selectors {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1732}

*Keyframe selectors* define[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_keyframe_selectors
primary="keyframes" secondary="selectors, including to and from"
data-type="indexterm"} points during an animation where we set the
values of the properties we want to animate. If you want a value at the
start of the animation, you declare it at the `0%` mark. If you want a
different value at the end of the animation, you declare the property
value at the `100%` mark. If you want a value a third of the way through
the animation, you declare it at the `33%` mark. These marks are defined
with keyframe selectors.

Keyframe selectors consist of a comma-separated list of one or more
percentage values or the keywords `from` or `to`. The keyword `from` is
equal to `0%`. The keyword `to` equals `100%`. The keyframe selectors
are used to specify the percentage along the duration of the animation
the keyframe represents. The keyframe itself is specified by the block
of property values declared on the selector. The `%` unit must be used
on percentage values. In other words, `0` is invalid as a keyframe
selector:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes W {
    from {  /* equivalent to 0% */
      left: 0;
      top: 0;
    }
    25%, 75% {
      top: 100%;
    }
    50% {
      top: 50%;
    }
    to {  /* equivalent to 100% */
      left: 100%;
      top: 0;
    }
}
```

This `@keyframes` animation, named `W`, when attached to a nonstatically
positioned element, would move that element along a W-shaped path. `W`
has five keyframes: one each at the `0%`, `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, and
`100%` marks. The `from` is the `0%` mark, while the `to` is the [`100%`
mark.]{.keep-together}
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/02_W.xhtml){.play}

Because the property values we set for the `25%` and `75%` mark are the
same, we can put the two keyframe selectors together as a
comma-separated list. This is very similar to regular selectors, which
you can group together with commas. Whether you keep those selectors on
one line (as in the example) or put each selector on its own line is up
to your personal preference.

Notice that keyframe selectors do not need to be listed in ascending
order. In the preceding example, we have the `25%` and `75%` on the same
line, with the `50%` mark coming after that declaration. For legibility,
it is highly encouraged to progress from the `0%` to the `100%` mark.
However, as demonstrated by the `75%` keyframe in this example, it is
not required. You could define your keyframes with the last first and
the first last, or scramble them up randomly, or whatever works for you.

## Omitting from and to Values {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1733}

primary="keyframes" secondary="omitting from or to values in"
data-type="indexterm"} is not specified, the user agent (browser)
constructs a `0%` keyframe. The implicit `0%` keyframe uses the original
values of the properties being animated, as if the `0%` keyframe were
declared with the same property values that impact the element when no
animation was applied---that is, unless another animation applied to
that element is currently animating the same property (see ["Invoking a
Named
Animation"](#ch19.xhtml_the-animation-name-property){data-type="xref"}
for details). Similarly, if the `100%` or `to` keyframe is not defined
and no other animations are being applied, the browser creates a faux
`100%` keyframe using the value the element would have had if no
animation had been set on it.

Say we have a `background-color` change animation:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes change_bgcolor {
    45% { background-color: green; }
    55% { background-color: blue; }
}
```

If the element originally had `background-color: red` set on it, it
would be as if the animation were as follows:
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/no0or100.xhtml){.play}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes change_bgcolor {
    0%   { background-color: red; }
    45%  { background-color: green; }
    55%  { background-color: blue; }
    100% { background-color: red; }
}
```

Or, remembering that we can include multiple identical keyframes as a
comma-separated list, this faux animation also could be written as shown
here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes change_bgcolor {
    0%, 100% { background-color: red; }
    45%  { background-color: green; }
    55%  { background-color: blue; }
}
```

Note the `background-color: red;` declarations are not part of the
original keyframe animation; they've just been filled in here for
clarity. We can include this `change_bgcolor` animation on many
elements, and the perceived animation will differ based on the element's
value for the `background-color` property in the nonanimated state.
Thus, an element that has a yellow background will animate from yellow
to green to blue and then back to yellow.

Although we've been using exclusively integer values for our
percentages, noninteger percentage values, such as `33.33%`, are
perfectly valid. Negative percentages, values greater than `100%`, and
values that aren't otherwise percentages or the keywords `to` or `from`
are invalid and will be ignored.

twice, overriding the value of the `left` property:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

  }
  50% {
    top: 50%;
  }
  to {

  }
}

Notice that `to` is declared along with `from` as keyframe selectors for
the first code block? That sets both `top` and `left` for the `to`
keyframe. Then, the `left` value is overridden for the `to` in the last
keyframe block.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1736}

Exceptions to the midpoint rule include `animating-timing-function` and
`visibility`, which are discussed in the next section.
:::

As long as an animatable property is included in at least one block with
a value that is different from the nonanimated attribute value, and
there is a calculable midpoint between those two values, that property
will animate.

If an animation is set between two property values that don't have a
calculable midpoint, the property may not animate correctly---or at all.
For example, you shouldn't declare an element's height to animate
between `height: auto` and `height: 300px`, because there is no easily
defined midpoint between `auto` and `300px`. The element will still
animate, but browsers will jump from the preanimated state to the
postanimated state halfway through the animation. Thus, for a 1-second
animation, the element will jump from `auto` height to `300px` height at
the 500-millisecond point in the animation.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/nomidpoint.xhtml){.play}
Other properties may animate over the length of the same animation;
e.g., if you change the background color, it will animate smoothly over
the animation. Only those properties that can't be animated between will
jump halfway through.

The behavior of your animation will be most predictable if you declare
both a 0% and a 100% value for every property you animate. For example,
if you declare `border-radius: 50%;` in your animation, you may want to
declare `border-radius: 0%;` as well, because the default value of
`border-radius` is `none`, not `0`, and there is no midpoint between
`none` and other values. Consider the difference in the following two
animations:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes round {
    100% {
        border-radius: 50%;
    }
}
@keyframes square_to_round {
    0% {
        border-radius: 0%;
    }
    100% {
        border-radius: 50%;
    }
}
```

The `round` animation will animate an element from the original
`border-radius` value of that element to `border-radius`: `50%` over the
duration of the animation. The `square_to_round` animation will animate
an element from `border-radius: 0%` to `border-radius: 50%` over the
duration of the animation. If the element starts out with square
corners, the two animations will have exactly the same effect. But if
the element starts out with rounded corners, `square_to_round` will jump
to [rectangular]{.keep-together} corners before it starts animating.

The `visibility` property[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037978144
primary="visibility property" secondary="animatability and"
data-type="indexterm"} is animatable, even though there is no midpoint
between `visibility:`{.keep-together} `hidden` and
`visibility: visible`. When you animate from `hidden` to `visible`, the
visibility value jumps from one value to the next at the keyframe where
the change is declared. So you don't get a smooth fade from visible to
hidden, or vice versa. The state changes in an instant.

While []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037974304
primary="animation-timing-function property" data-type="indexterm"}the
`animation-timing-function` is not, in fact, an animatable property,
when included in a keyframe block, the animation timing will switch to
the newly declared value at that point in the animation for the
properties within that keyframe selector block. The change in animation
timing is not animated; it simply switches to the new value for those
properties only, and only until the next keyframe. This allows you to
vary the [timing]{.keep-together} function from one keyframe to another.

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037966256
primary="findRule() method" data-type="indexterm"}enables finding,
appending, and deleting keyframe rules. You can change the content of a
keyframe block within a given `@keyframes` declaration with
`appendRule(`*`n`*`)` or `deleteRule(`*`n`*`)`, where *`n`* is the full
selector of that keyframe. You can return the contents of a keyframe
with `findRule(`*`n`*`)`. Consider this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes W {
  from, to { top: 0; left: 0; }
  25%, 75% { top: 100%; }
  50%      { top: 50%; }
  to       { left: 100%; }
}
```

The `appendRule()`, `deleteRule()`, and `findRule()` methods take the
full keyframe selector as an argument, as shown in the following:

``` {code-language="js" data-type="programlisting"}
// Get the selector and content block for a keyframe
var aRule = myAnimation.findRule('25%, 75%').cssText;

// Delete the 50% keyframe
myAnimation.deleteRule('50%');

// Add a 53% keyframe to the end of the animation
myAnimation.appendRule('53% {top: 50%;}');
```

The statement `myAnimation.findRule('25%, 75%').cssText`, where
`myAnimation` is pointing to a keyframe animation, returns the keyframe
that matches `25%, 75%`. It would not match any block using either `25%`
or `75%` only. If `myAnimation` refers to the `W` animation,
`myAnimation.findRule('25%, 75%').cssText` returns
`25%, 75% { top: 100%; }`.

Similarly, `myAnimation.deleteRule('50%')` will delete the *last* 50%
keyframe---so if we have multiple `50%` keyframes, the last one listed
will be the first to go. Conversely,
`myAnimation.appendRule('53% {top: 50%;}')` appends a 53% keyframe after
the last keyframe of the `@keyframes` block.

keyframe animation, you can apply that animation to elements and/or
pseudo-elements. CSS provides numerous animation properties to attach a
keyframe animation to an element and control its progression. At a
minimum, you need to include the name of the animation for the element
to animate, and a duration if you want the animation to be visible.
(Without a duration, the animation will happen in zero time.)

You can attach animation properties to an element in two ways: include
all the animation properties separately, or declare all the properties
in one line by using the `animation` shorthand property (or a
combination of shorthand and longhand properties). Let's start with the
individual properties.

rules.

```
The default value is `none`, which means no animation is applied to the
selected elements. The `none` value can be used to override any
animation applied elsewhere in the CSS cascade. (This is also the reason
you don't want to name your animation `none`, unless you're a
masochist.) [[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/badnames.xhtml){.play}

Using the `change_bgcolor` keyframe animation defined in ["Omitting from
and to
Values"](#ch19.xhtml_omitting-from-and-to-values){data-type="xref"}, we
have this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
 div {
     animation-name: change_bgcolor;
 }
```

This simple rule applies the `change_bgcolor` animation to all `<div>`
elements, however many or few are on the page. To apply more than one
animation, include more than one comma-separated animation name:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
 div {
    animation-name: change_bgcolor, round, W;
 }
```

If one of the included keyframe identifiers does not exist, the series
of animations will not fail; rather, the failed animation will be
ignored, and the valid animations will be applied. While ignored
initially, the failed animation will be applied if and when that
keyframe animation comes into existence as a valid animation. Consider
the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
 div {
    animation-name: change_bgcolor, spin, round, W;
 }
```

In this example, assume that no `spin` keyframe animation is defined.
The `spin` animation will not be applied, while the `change_bgcolor`,
`round`, and `W` animations will occur. Should a `spin` keyframe
animation come into existence through scripting, it will be applied at
that time. [[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/nameaddedlater.xhtml){.play}

If more []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037693568 primary="animation"
secondary="multiples" data-type="indexterm"}than one animation is
applied to an element and those animations have repeated properties, the
later animations override the property values in the earlier animations.
For example, if more than two background color changes are applied
concurrently in two different keyframe animations, whichever animation
was listed later will override the background property declarations of
animations earlier in the list, but *only* if the properties (background
colors, in this case) are being animated at the same time.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/no0or100.xhtml){.play}
For more on this, see ["Animation, Specificity, and Precedence
Order"](#ch19.xhtml_animation-specificity-and-precedence-order){data-type="xref"}.

For example, assume the following, and further assume that the
animations happen over a period of 10 seconds:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {animation-name: change_bgcolor, bg-shift;}

@keyframes bg-shift {
    0%, 100% {background-color: cyan;}
    35% {background-color: orange;}
    55% {background-color: red;}
    65% {background-color: purple;}
}
@keyframes change_bgcolor {
    0%, 100% {background-color: yellow;}
    45% {background-color: green;}
    55% {background-color: blue;}
}
```

The background will animate from cyan to orange to red to purple and
then back to cyan, thanks to `bg-shift`. Because it comes last in the
list of animations, its keyframes take precedence. Anytime multiple
animations specify behavior for the same property at the same point in
time, the animation listed last in the value of `animation-name` will be
[in effect.]{.keep-together}

What's interesting is what happens if the `from` (`0%`) or `to` (`100%`)
keyframes are omitted from the animation in force. For example, let's
remove the first keyframes defined in [`bg-shift`:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {animation-name: change_bgcolor, bg-shift;}

@keyframes bg-shift {
    35% {background-color: orange;}
    55% {background-color: red;}
    65% {background-color: purple;}
}
@keyframes change_bgcolor {
    0%, 100% {background-color: yellow;}
    45% {background-color: green;}
    55% {background-color: blue;}
}
```

Now no background colors are defined at the beginning and end of
`bg-shift`. In a situation like this, when a `0%` or `100%` keyframe is
not specified, the user agent constructs a `0%`/`100%` keyframe by using
the computed values of the properties being animated.

These are concerns only when two different keyframe blocks are trying to
change the same property's values. In this case, it is
`background-color`. On the other hand, if one keyframe block animates
`background-color` while another animates `padding`, the two animations
will not collide, and both the background color and padding will be
animated together.

Simply applying an animation to an element is not enough for the element
to visibly animate. For that to happen, the animation must take place
over some amount of time. For that, we have the `animation-duration`
property.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037509136 primary=""

The `animation-duration` property[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037443008
primary="animationend event"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037442272
primary="animationstart event" data-type="indexterm"} defines the length
of time, either in seconds (`s`) or milliseconds (`ms`), it should take
to complete one cycle through all the keyframes of the animation. If you
don't declare `animation-duration`, the animation will still be run with
a duration of `0s`, with `animationstart` and `animationend` still being
fired even though the animation, taking `0s`, is imperceptible. Negative
time values are not permitted for `animation-duration`.

When specifying a duration, you must include the second (`s`) or
millisecond (`ms`) unit. If you have more than one animation, you can
include a different `animation-duration` for each by including more than
one comma-separated time duration:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
   animation-name: change_bgcolor, round, W;
   animation-duration: 200ms, 100ms, 0.5s;
}
```

If you supply an invalid value within your comma-separated list of
durations (e.g., `animation-duration: 200ms, 0, 0.5s`) the entire
declaration will fail, and it [will behave]{.keep-together} as if
`animation-duration: 0s` had been declared; `0` is not a valid time
value. [[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/duration_broken_value.xhtml){.play}

Generally, you will want to include an `animation-duration` value for
each `animation-name` provided. If you have only one duration, all the
animations will last the same amount of time. Having fewer
`animation-duration` values than `animation-name` values in your
comma-separated property value list will not fail: rather, the values
will be repeated as a group. Say we have the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    animation-name: change_bgcolor, spin, round, W;
    animation-duration: 200ms, 5s;
       /* same effect as '200ms, 5s, 200ms, 5s' */
}
```

The `change_bgcolor` and `round` animations will be run over `200ms`,
and the `spin` and `W` animations will run for `5s`.

If you have a greater number of `animation-duration` values than
`animation-name` values, the extra values will be ignored. If one of the
included animations does not exist, the series of animations and
animation durations will not fail; the failed animation, along with its
duration, is ignored:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
    animation-name: change_bgcolor, spinner, round, W;
    animation-duration: 200ms, 5s, 100ms, 0.5s;
}
```

In this example, the duration `5s` is associated with `spinner`. There
is no `spinner` animation, though, so `spinner` doesn't exist, and the
`5s` and `spinner` are both ignored. Should a `spinner` animation come
into existence, it will be applied to `<div>` elements and last [5
seconds]{.keep-together}.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037287184 primary=""

```
By default, the animation will occur once (because the default value is
`1`). If another value is given for `animation-iteration-count`, and
there isn't a negative value for the `animation-delay` property, the
animation will repeat the number of times specified by the value of the
property, which can be any number or the keyword `infinite`. The
following declarations will cause their animations to be repeated 2, 5,
and 13 times, respectively:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
animation-iteration-count: 2;
animation-iteration-count: 5;
animation-iteration-count: 13;
```

If the value of `animation-iteration-count` is not an integer, the
animation will still run, but will cut off mid-iteration on the final
iteration. For example, `animation-iteration-count: 1.25` will iterate
through the animation one and a quarter times, cutting off 25% of the
way through the second iteration. If the value is `0.25` on an 8-second
animation, the animation will play about 25% of the way through, ending
after 2 seconds.

Negative numbers are not permitted. If an invalid value is given, the
default value of `1` will lead to a default single iteration.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/odditeration.xhtml){.play}

Interestingly, `0` is a valid value for the `animation-iteration-count`
property. When set to `0`, the animation still occurs, but zero times.
This is similar to setting `animation-duration: 0s`: it will throw both
an `animationstart` and an `animationend` event.

If you are attaching more than one animation to an element or
pseudo-element, include a comma-separated list of values for
`animation-name`, `animation-duration`, and `animation-iteration-count`:

``` {.pagebreak-before code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.flag {
    animation-name: red, white, blue;
    animation-duration: 2s, 4s, 6s;
    animation-iteration-count: 3, 5;
}
```

The `iteration-count` values (and all other animation property values)
will be assigned in the order of the comma-separated `animation-name`
property value. Extra values are ignored. Missing values cause the
existing values to be repeated, as with `animation-iteration-count` in
the preceding scenario.

The preceding example has more name values than count values, so the
count values will repeat: `red` and `blue` will iterate three times, and
`white` will iterate five times. We have the same number of name values
as duration values; therefore, the duration values will not repeat. The
`red` animation lasts 2 seconds, iterating three times, and therefore
will run for a total of 6 seconds. The `white` animation lasts 4
seconds, iterating five times, for a total of 20 seconds. The `blue`
animation is 6 seconds per iteration with the repeated three iterations
value, animating for a total of 18 seconds.

Invalid values will invalidate the entire declaration, leading to the
animations being played once each.

If we want all three animations to end at the same time, even though
their durations differ, we can control that with
`animation-iteration-count`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.flag {
    animation-name: red, white, blue;
    animation-duration: 2s, 4s, 6s;
    animation-iteration-count: 6, 3, 2;
}
```

In this example, the `red`, `white`, and `blue` animations will last for
a total of 12 seconds each, because the product of the durations and
iteration counts in each case totals 12 [seconds.]{.keep-together}

You can also include the keyword `infinite` instead of a number, for a
duration. This will make the animation iterate forever, or until
something makes it stop, such as removing the animation name, removing
the element from the DOM, or pausing the play
state.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037098608 primary=""

The `animation-direction` property defines the direction of the
animation's progression through the keyframes. It has four possible
values:

`normal`

:   Each iteration of the animation progresses from the 0% keyframe to
    the 100% keyframe; this value is the default.

`reverse`

:   Sets each []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037072368
    primary="reverse keyword, animation-direction"
    data-type="indexterm"}iteration to play in reverse keyframe order,
    always progressing from the 100% keyframe to the 0% keyframe.
    Reversing the animation direction also reverses the
    `animation-timing-function` (which is described in ["Changing the
    Internal Timing of
    Animations"](#ch19.xhtml_changing-the-internal-timing-of-animations){data-type="xref"}).

`alternate`

:   The first []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037068944
    primary="alternate keyword, animation-direction"
    data-type="indexterm"}iteration (and each subsequent odd-numbered
    iteration) proceeds from 0% to 100%, and the second iteration (and
    each subsequent even-numbered cycle) reverses direction, proceeding
    from 100% to 0%. This has an effect only if you have more than one
    iteration.

`alternate-reverse`

:   Similar[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797037066608
    primary="alternate-reverse keyword, animation-direction"
    data-type="indexterm"} to the `alternate` value, except it's the
    reverse. The first iteration (and each subsequent odd-numbered
    iteration) will proceed from 100% to 0%, and the second iteration
    (and each subsequent even-numbered cycle) reverses direction,
    proceeding from 100% to 0%:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.ball {
    animation-name: bouncing;
    animation-duration: 400ms;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-direction: alternate-reverse;
}
@keyframes bouncing {
    from {
        transform: translateY(500px);
    }
    to {
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are bouncing a ball, but we want to start by
dropping it, not by throwing it up in the air: we want it to alternate
between going down and up, rather than up and down, so
`animation-direction: alternate-reverse` is the most appropriate value
for our needs.

This is a rudimentary way of making a ball bounce. When balls are
bouncing, they are moving slowest when they reach their apex and fastest
when they reach their nadir. We include this example here to illustrate
the `alternate-reverse` animation directions. We'll revisit the bouncing
animation to make it more realistic with the addition of timing (in
["Changing the Internal Timing of
Animations"](#ch19.xhtml_changing-the-internal-timing-of-animations){data-type="xref"}).
We'll also discuss how, when the animation is iterating in the reverse
direction, the `animation-timing-function` is
reversed.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797036983504 primary=""

By default, an animation begins iterating as soon as it is applied to
the element, with a [0-second]{.keep-together} delay. A positive value
for `animation-delay` delays the start of the animation until the time
listed as the value of the property has elapsed.

Negative values for `animation-delay` are allowed and create interesting
effects. A negative delay will execute the animation immediately but
will begin animating the element partway through the attached animation.
For example, if `animation-delay: -4s` and `animation-duration: 10s` are
set on an element, the animation will begin immediately but will start
approximately 40% of the way through the first animation, and will end
[6 seconds]{.keep-together} later.

We say *approximately* because the []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797036957296
primary="animation-timing-function property"
data-type="indexterm"}animation will not necessarily start at precisely
the 40% keyframe block: when the 40% mark of an animation occurs depends
on the value of the `animation-timing-function`. If
`animation-timing-function: linear` is set, the animation state will
start 40% of the way through the animation:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div {
  animation-name: move;
  animation-duration: 10s;
  animation-delay: -4s;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
}

@keyframes move {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(1000px);
  }
}
```

In this `linear` animation example, we have a 10-second animation with a
delay of --4 seconds. In this case, the animation will start immediately
40% of the way through the animation, with the `<div>` translated 400
pixels to the right of its original position, and last only 6 seconds.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/fortypercent.xhtml){.play}

If an animation is set to occur 10 times, with a delay of --600
milliseconds and an animation duration of 200 milliseconds, the element
will start animating right away, at the beginning of the fourth
iteration:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.ball {
  animation-name: bounce;
  animation-duration: 200ms;
  animation-delay: -600ms;
  animation-iteration-count: 10;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
@keyframes bounce {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(500px);
  }
}
```

Instead of animating for 2,000 milliseconds (200 ms × 10 = 2,000 ms, or
2 seconds), starting in the normal direction, the ball will animate for
1,400 milliseconds (or 1.4 seconds) with the animation starting
immediately---but at the start of the fourth iteration, *and* in the
reverse direction.

The animation starts out in reverse because `animation-direction` is set
to `alternate`, meaning every even-numbered iteration proceeds from the
100% keyframe to the 0% [keyframe.]{.keep-together} The fourth
iteration, which is an even-numbered iteration, is the first visible
iteration. [[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/ball_animation_delay_negative.xhtml){.play}

In this case, the animation will throw the `animationstart` event
immediately. The `animationend` event will occur at the
1,400-millisecond mark. The ball will be tossed up, rather [than
bounced,]{.keep-together} throwing six `animationiteration` events,
after 200, 400, 600, 800, 1,000, and 1,200 milliseconds. While the
iteration count is set to 10, we get only six `animationiteration`
events because we are getting only seven iterations; three iterations
don't occur because of the negative `animation-delay`, and the last
iteration [concludes]{.keep-together} at the same time as the
`animationend` event. Remember, when an
`animationiteration`{.keep-together} event would occur at the same time
as an `animationend` event, the `animationiteration` event does not
occur.

Let's take a deeper look at animation events before
continuing.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797036780912 primary=""
startref="ix_animate_delay"

:::::::: {#ch19.xhtml_animation-events .sect2}
## Exploring Animation Events {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1750}

The three types of []{#ch19.xhtml_ix_event_animate primary="events"
secondary="animation"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_animate_event
primary="animation" secondary="events" data-type="indexterm"}animation
events are `animationstart`, `animationiteration`, and `animationend`.
Each event has three read-only properties: `animationName`,
`elapsedTime`, and `pseudoElement`.

The `animationstart` event[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797036770544
primary="animationstart event" data-type="indexterm"} fires at the start
of the animation: after the `animation-delay` (if present) has expired,
or immediately if no delay is set. If a negative `animation-delay` value
is present, the `animationstart` will fire immediately, with an
`elapsedTime` equal to the absolute value of the delay.

The `animationend` event[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797036766896
primary="animationend event" data-type="indexterm"} fires when the
animation finishes. If the `animation-iteration-count` is set to
`infinite`, then as long as the `animation-duration` is set to a time
greater than `0`, the `animationend` event will never fire. If the
`animation-duration` is set or defaults to 0 seconds, even when the
iteration count is infinite, `animationstart` and
`animationend`{.keep-together} will occur virtually simultaneously, and
in that order. These are illustrated in the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.noAnimationEnd {
    animation-name: myAnimation;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
.startAndEndSimultaneously {
    animation-name: myAnimation;
    animation-duration: 0s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
```

The `animationiteration` event[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797036732112
primary="animationiteration event" data-type="indexterm"} fires
*between* iterations. The `animationend` event
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/events.xhtml){.play}
fires at the conclusion of iterations that do not occur at the same time
as the conclusion of the animation itself; thus, the
`animationiteration` and `animationend` events do *not* fire
simultaneously:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.noAnimationIteration {
    animation-name: myAnimation;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
}
```

In the `.noAnimationIteration` example, with the
`animation-iteration-count` set to a single occurrence, the animation
ends at the conclusion of the first and only iteration. Whenever the
`animationiteration` event would occur at the same time as an
`animationend`{.keep-together} event, the `animationend` event occurs
but the `animationiteration` event does not.

When the `animation-iteration-count` property is omitted, or when its
value is `1` or less, no `animationiteration` event will be fired. As
long as an iteration finishes (even if it's a partial iteration) and
another iteration begins, if the duration of that subsequent iteration
is greater than `0s`, an `animationiteration` event will be fired:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.noAnimationIteration {
    animation-name: myAnimation;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-iteration-count: 4;
    animation-delay: -3s;
}
```

When an animation iterates through fewer cycles than listed in the
`animation-iteration-count` because of a negative `animation-delay`,
there are no `animationiteration` events for the cycles that didn't
occur. The preceding example code has no `animationiteration` events, as
the first three cycles do not occur (because of the `-3s`
`animation-delay`), and the last cycle finishes at the same time the
animation ends.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/events2.xhtml){.play}

In that example, the `elapsedTime` on the `animationstart` event is `3`,
as it is equal to the absolute value of the delay.

:::: {#ch19.xhtml_animation-chaining .sect3}
### Animation chaining {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1751}

You can use `animation-delay` to []{#ch19.xhtml_ix_chaining_ch19
primary="chaining" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_animate_chain
primary="animation" secondary="chaining" data-type="indexterm"}chain
animations together so the next animation starts immediately after the
conclusion of the preceding animation:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.rainbow {
    animation-name: red, orange, yellow, blue, green;
    animation-duration: 1s, 3s, 5s, 7s, 11s;
    animation-delay: 3s, 4s, 7s, 12s, 19s;
}
```

In this example, the `red` animation starts after a 3-second delay and
lasts 1 second, meaning the `animationend` event occurs at the 4-second
mark. This example starts each subsequent animation at the conclusion of
the previous animation. This is known as *CSS animation chaining*.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animationchain.xhtml){.play}

By including a 4-second delay on the second animation, the `orange`
animation will begin interpolating the `@keyframe` property values at
the 4-second mark, starting the `orange` animation immediately at the
conclusion of the `red` animation. The `orange` animation concludes at
the 7-second mark---it lasts 3 seconds, starting after a 4-second
delay---which is the delay set on the third, or `yellow`, animation,
making the `yellow` animation begin immediately after the `orange`
animation ends.

This is an example of chaining animations on a single element. You can
also use the `animation-delay` property to chain the animations for
different elements:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
li:first-of-type {
    animation-name: red;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-delay: 3s;
}
li:nth-of-type(2) {
    animation-name: orange;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-delay: 4s;
}
li:nth-of-type(3)  {
    animation-name: yellow;
    animation-duration: 5s;
    animation-delay: 7s;
}
li:nth-of-type(4) {
    animation-name: green;
    animation-duration: 7s;
    animation-delay: 12s;
}
li:nth-of-type(5) {
    animation-name: blue;
    animation-duration: 11s;
    animation-delay: 19s;
}
```

If you want a group of list items to animate in order,
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animationchain2a.xhtml){.play}
appearing as if the animations were chained in sequence, the
`animation-delay` of each list item should be the combined time of the
`animation-duration` and `animation-delay` of the previous animation.

While you can use JavaScript and the `animationend`
event[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_animationend primary="animationend event"
data-type="indexterm"} from one animation to determine when to attach a
subsequent animation, which we discuss shortly, the `animation-delay`
property is an appropriate method of using CSS animation properties to
chain animations. There is one caveat: animations are the lowest
priority on the UI thread. Therefore, if you have a script running that
is occupying the UI thread, depending on the browser and which
properties [are being]{.keep-together} animated and what property values
are set on the element, the browser may let the delays expire while
waiting until the UI thread is available before starting more
animations.

primary="animation" secondary="UI thread usage by"
data-type="indexterm"}animations take place on the UI thread. In most
browsers, when opacity or transforms are being animated, the animation
takes place on the graphics processing unit (GPU) instead of the central
processing unit (CPU), and doesn't rely on the UI thread's availability.
[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797010385696 primary="animation"
secondary="visual stuttering of (jank)" data-type="indexterm"}If those
properties are not part of the animation, the unavailability of the UI
thread can lead to visual stutters (sometimes called *jank*):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* Don’t do this */
* {
    transform: translateZ(0);
}
```

Putting an element into 3D space by using 3D transforms (see
[Chapter 17](../Text/ch17.xhtml#transforms){data-type="xref"}) moves
that element into its own layer, allowing for jank-free animations. For
this reason, the `translateZ` [hack---the]{.keep-together} thing we just
told you not to do---became overused, and led to the creation of the
`will-change` property (see ["Using the will-change
Property"](#ch19.xhtml_will-change){data-type="xref"} for more).

While putting a few elements onto their own layers with this hack is OK,
some devices have limited video memory. Each independent layer you
create uses video memory and takes time to move from the UI thread to
the composited layer on the GPU. The more layers you create, the higher
the performance cost.

For []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797010377648 primary="box-model properties"
data-type="indexterm"}improved performance, whenever possible, include
`transform` and `opacity` in your animations rather than `top`, `left`,
`bottom`, `right`, and `visibility`. Not only does it improve
performance by using the GPU over the CPU, but when you change box-model
properties, the browser needs to reflow and repaint, which is bad for
performance. Just don't put everything on the GPU, or you'll run into
different [performance]{.keep-together} issues.
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
If you are able to rely on JavaScript, another way of chaining
animations is listening for `animationend` events to start subsequent
animations: [[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animationchain2.xhtml){.play}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<script>
  document.querySelectorAll('li')[0].addEventListener( 'animationend',
    () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[1].style.animationName = 'orange';
    },
    false );

  document.querySelectorAll('li')[1].addEventListener( 'animationend',
    () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[2].style.animationName = 'yellow';
    },
    false );

  document.querySelectorAll('li')[2].addEventListener( 'animationend',
    () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[3].style.animationName = 'green';
    },
    false );

  document.querySelectorAll('li')[3].addEventListener( 'animationend',
    () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[4].style.animationName = 'blue';
    },
    false );
</script>

<style>
  li:first-of-type {
    animation-name: red;
    animation-duration: 1s;
  }
  li:nth-of-type(2) {
    animation-duration: 3s;
  }
  li:nth-of-type(3)  {
    animation-duration: 5s;
  }
  li:nth-of-type(4) {
    animation-duration: 7s;
  }
  li:nth-of-type(5)  {
    animation-duration: 11s;
  }
</style>
```

In this example, there is an event handler on each of the first four
list items, listening for that list item's `animationend` event. When
the `animationend` event occurs, the event listeners add an
`animation-name` to the subsequent list item.

As you can see in the styles, this animation chaining method doesn't
employ `animation-delay` at all. Instead, the JavaScript event listeners
attach animations to each element by setting the `animation-name`
property when the `animationend` event [is thrown.]{.keep-together}

You'll also note that the `animation-name` is included for only the
first list item. The other list items have only an `animation-duration`
with no `animation-name`, and therefore no attached animations. Adding
`animation-name` via JavaScript is what attaches and starts the
animation, at least in this example. To start or restart an animation,
the animation name must be removed and then added back---at which point
all the animation properties take effect, including `animation-delay`.

Instead of writing the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<script>
  document.querySelectorAll('li')[2].addEventListener( 'animationend',
    () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[3].style.animationName = 'green';
    },
    false );

  document.querySelectorAll('li')[3].addEventListener( 'animationend',
    () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[4].style.animationName = 'blue';
    },
    false );
</script

<style>
  li:nth-of-type(4) {
    animation-duration: 7s;
  }
  li:nth-of-type(5)  {
    animation-duration: 11s;
  }
</style>
```

we could have written this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
<script>
  document.querySelectorAll('li')[2].addEventListener( 'animationend',
    () => {
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[3].style.animationName = 'green';
        document.querySelectorAll('li')[4].style.animationName = 'blue';
    },
  false );
</script>

<style>
  li:nth-of-type(4) {
    animation-duration: 7s;
  }
  li:nth-of-type(5)  {
    animation-delay: 7s;
    animation-duration: 11s;
  }
</style>
```

When the `blue` animation name is added to the fifth list item at the
same time we added `green`, the delay on the fifth element takes effect
at that point in time and starts
expiring.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009995056 primary=""
startref="ix_animationend" data-type="indexterm"}

While changing the values of animation properties (other than name) on
the element during an animation has no effect on the animation, removing
or adding an `animation-name` does have an impact. You can't change the
animation duration from `100ms` to `400ms` in the middle of an
animation. You can't switch the delay from `-200ms` to `5s` once the
delay has already been applied. You can, however, stop and start the
animation by removing it and reapplying it. In the preceding JavaScript
example, we started the animations by applying them to the elements.

In addition, setting `display: none` on an element terminates [any
animation.]{.keep-together} Updating the `display` back to a visible
value restarts the animation from the beginning. If `animation-delay`
has a positive value, the delay will have to expire before the
`animationstart`{.keep-together} event happens and any animations occur.
If the delay is negative, the animation will start midway through an
iteration, exactly as it would have if the animation had been applied
any other way.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009809344 primary=""

### Animation iteration delay {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1753}

What is an []{#ch19.xhtml_ix_animate_iteration_cont primary="animation"
secondary="iteration control" data-type="indexterm"}animation iteration
delay? Sometimes you want an animation to occur multiple times but want
to wait a specific amount of time between each iteration.

While there is no such thing as an animation iteration delay property,
you can employ the `animation-delay` property, incorporate delays within
your keyframe declaration, or use JavaScript to fake it. The best method
for faking it depends on the number of iterations, performance, and
whether the delays are all equal in length.

Let's say you want your element to grow three times, but want to wait 4
seconds between each 1-second iteration. You can include the delay
within your keyframe definition and iterate through it three times:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.animate3times {
    background-color: red;
    animation: color_and_scale_after_delay;
    animation-iteration-count: 3;
    animation-duration: 5s;
}

@keyframes color_and_scale_after_delay {
    80% {
        transform: scale(1);
        background-color: red;
    }
    80.1% {
        background-color: green;
        transform: scale(0.5);
    }
    100% {
        background-color: yellow;
        transform: scale(1.5);
    }
}
```

Note the first keyframe selector is at the 80% mark and matches the
default state.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animation-iteration-delay1.xhtml){.play}
This will animate your element three times: it stays in the default
state for 80% of the 5-second animation (not changing for 4 seconds) and
then moves from green to yellow and small to big over the last 1 second
of the animation before iterating again, stopping after three
iterations.

This method works for any number of iterations of the animation.
Unfortunately, it is a good solution only if the delay between each
iteration is identical and you don't want to reuse the animation with
any other timing, such as a delay of 6 seconds.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animation-iteration-delay.xhtml){.play}
If you want to change the delay between each iteration while not
changing the duration of the change in size and color, you have to write
a new `@keyframes` definition.

To enable multiple iteration delays between animations, we could create
a single animation and bake the effect of three different delays into
the animation keyframe definition:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.animate3times {
    background-color: red;
    animation: color_and_scale_3_times;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
    animation-duration: 15s;
}

@keyframes color_and_scale_3_times {
  0%, 13.32%, 20.01%, 40%, 46.67%, 93.32% {
        transform: scale(1);
        background-color: red;
  }
    13.33%, 40.01%, 93.33% {
        background-color: green;
        transform: scale(0.5);
  }
    20%, 46.66%, 100% {
        background-color: yellow;
        transform: scale(1.5);
  }
}
```

This method may be more difficult to code and maintain, however.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animation-iteration-delay2.xhtml){.play}
It works for only a single cycle of the animation. To change the number
of animations or the iteration delay durations, another `@keyframes`
declaration would be required. This example is even less robust than the
previous one, but it does allow for different between-iteration delays.

A solution is specifically allowed in the animation specification:
declare an animation multiple times, each with a different
`animation-delay` value:
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animation-iteration-delay3.xhtml){.play}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.animate3times {
  animation: color_and_scale, color_and_scale, color_and_scale;
  animation-delay: 0, 4s, 10s;
  animation-duration: 1s;
}

@keyframes color_and_scale {
    0% {
        background-color: green;
        transform: scale(0.5);
    }
    100% {
        background-color: yellow;
        transform: scale(1.5);
    }
}
```

Here, we've attached the animation three times, each with a different
delay. In this case, each animation iteration concludes before the next
one proceeds.

If animations overlap while they're concurrently animating, the values
will be the values from the last declared animation. As is true whenever
multiple animations are changing an element's property at the same time,
the animation that occurs last in the sequence of animation names will
override any animations occurring before it in the list of names. In
declaring three `color_and_scale` animations but at different intervals,
the value of the property of the last iteration of the `color_and_scale`
animation will override the values of the previous ones that haven't yet
concluded. [[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/animation-iteration-delay4.xhtml){.play}

The safest, most robust, and most cross-browser-friendly method of
faking an animation iteration delay property is to use JavaScript's
animation events. Detach the animation from the element on
`animationend`, and then reattach it after the iteration delay. If [all
the]{.keep-together} iteration delays are the same, you can use
`setInterval`; if they vary, use
`setTimeout`{.keep-together}:[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009422176 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009421328 primary=""

``` {code-language="js" data-type="programlisting"}
let iteration = 0;
const el = document.getElementById('myElement');

el.addEventListener('animationend', () => {
  let time = ++iteration * 1000;

  el.classList.remove('animationClass');

  setTimeout( () => {
    el.classList.add('animationClass');
  }, time);

});
```

Other than the step timing functions, described in ["Using step timing
functions"](#ch19.xhtml_step-timing-functions){data-type="xref"}, the
timing functions are all Bézier curves. Just like the
`transition-timing-function`, the CSS specification provides for five
predefined Bézier curve keywords, which we described in the preceding
chapter (see
[Table 18-1](../Text/ch18.xhtml#cubic_bezier){data-type="xref"} and
[Figure 18-3](../Text/ch18.xhtml#tr_fig0203){data-type="xref"}).

A handy tool to visualize []{#ch19.xhtml_ix_cubic_bezier_func3
primary="cubic-Bézier timing functions"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_bezier_func3
primary="Bézier curve functions" data-type="indexterm"}Bézier curves and
to create your own is [Lea Verou's cubic Bézier
visualizer](https://cubic-bezier.com).

The []{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009290256
primary="ease-in-out timing function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009289584
primary="ease timing function" data-type="indexterm"}default `ease` has
a slow start, then speeds up, and ends slowly. This
[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009288336 primary="linear timing function"
data-type="indexterm"}function is similar to `ease-in-out`, which has a
greater acceleration at the beginning. The `linear` timing function, as
the name describes, creates an animation that animates at a constant
speed.

The `ease-in` timing[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009285824
primary="ease-in timing function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009285088
primary="ease-out timing function" data-type="indexterm"} function
creates an animation that is slow to start, gains speed, and then stops
abruptly. The opposite `ease-out` timing function starts at full speed,
then slows progressively as it reaches the conclusion of the animation
iteration.

If none of these suit your needs, you can create your own Bézier curve
timing function by passing four values, such as the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8);
```

While the *x* values must be between 0 and 1, by using values for *y*
that are greater than 1 or less than 0, you can create a bouncing
effect, making the animation bounce up and down between values, rather
than going consistently in a single direction. Consider the following
timing function, whose rather outlandish Bézier curve is (partly)
illustrated in
[Figure 19-1](#ch19.xhtml_an-outlandish-bezier-curve){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.snake {
  animation-name: shrink;
  animation-duration: 10s;
  animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 4, 1, -4);
  animation-fill-mode: both;
}

@keyframes shrink {
  0% {
    width: 500px;
  }
  100% {
    width: 100px;
  }
}
```

<h6 id="ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1756"><span class="label">Figure 19-1.
</span>An outlandish Bézier curve</h6>
</div>
</figure>

This `animation-timing-function` curve makes the animated property's
values go outside the boundaries of the values set in the `0%` and
`100%` keyframes. In this example, we are shrinking an element from
`500px` to `100px`. However, because of the `cubic-bezier` values, the
element we're shrinking will actually grow to be wider than the `500px`
width defined in the `0%` keyframe and narrower than the `100px` width
defined in the `100%` keyframe, as shown in
[Figure 19-2](#ch19.xhtml_an_fig0303){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch19.xhtml_an_fig0303" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1757"><span class="label">Figure 19-2.
</span>Effect of outlandish Bézier curve</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In this scenario, the element starts with a width of `500px`, defined in
the `0%` keyframe. It then quickly shrinks to a width of about `40px`,
which is narrower than `width: 100px` defined in the `100%` keyframe.
From there, it slowly expands to about `750px` wide, which is larger
than the original width of `500px`. It then quickly shrinks back to
`width: 100px`, ending the animation iteration.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/cubicbezierprint.xhtml){.play}

You may have realized that the curve created by our animation is the
same curve as the Bézier curve. Just as the S-curve goes outside the
normal bounding box, the width of the animated element goes narrower
than the smaller width we set of `100px`, and wider than the larger
width we set of `500px`.

The Bézier curve has the appearance of a snake because one *y*
coordinate is positive, and the other negative. If both are positive
values greater than 1 or both are negative values less than --1, the
Bézier curve is arc-shaped, going above or below one of the values set,
but not bouncing out of bounds on both ends like the S-curve.

Any timing function declared with `animation-timing-function` sets the
timing for the normal animation direction, when the animation is
progressing from the `0%` keyframe to the `100%` keyframe. When the
animation is running in the reverse direction, from the `100%` keyframe
to the `0%` keyframe, the animation timing function is
reversed.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009139184 primary=""
startref="ix_bezier_func3"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797009138208 primary=""
startref="ix_cubic_bezier_func3" data-type="indexterm"}

Remember the bouncing-ball example in
["animation-direction"](#ch19.xhtml_animation-direction){data-type="xref"}?
The bouncing wasn't very realistic, because the original example
defaulted to `ease` for its timing function. With
`animation-timing-function`, we can apply `ease-in` to the animation so
that when the ball is dropping, it gets faster as it nears its nadir at
the `100%` keyframe. When it is bouncing upward, it animates in the
reverse direction, from `100%` to `0%`, so the
`animating-timing-function` is reversed as well---in this case, to
`ease-out`---slowing down as it reaches the apex:

### Using step timing functions {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1758}

The step []{#ch19.xhtml_ix_step_end_time_func
primary="step-end timing function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_step_strt_time_func
primary="step-start timing function"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch19.xhtml_ix_step_time_func2
primary="step timing functions" data-type="indexterm"}timing functions,
`step-start`, `step-end`, and `steps()`, aren't Bézier curves. They're
not curves at all. Rather, they're *tweening* definitions. The `steps()`
function is most useful when it comes to character or sprite animation.

The `steps()` function divides the animation into a series of
equal-length steps. The function takes two parameters: the number of
steps and the change point (more on that in a moment).

The number-of-steps parameter value must be a positive integer. The
animation length will be divided equally into the number of steps
provided. For example, if the animation duration is 1 second and the
number of steps is 5, the animation will be divided into five
200-millisecond steps, with the element being redrawn to the page five
times, at 200-millisecond intervals, moving 20% through the animation at
each interval.

To understand how this works, think of a flip book. Each page in a flip
book contains a single drawing or picture that changes slightly from one
page to the next, like one frame from a movie reel stamped onto each
page. When the pages of a flip book are rapidly flipped through (hence
the name), the pictures appear as an animated motion. You can create
similar animations with CSS by using an image sprite, the
`background-position` property, and the `steps()` timing function.

[Figure 19-3](#ch19.xhtml_an_sprite){data-type="xref"} shows an image
sprite containing several images that change just slightly, like the
drawings on the individual pages of a flip book.

<figure>
<div id="ch19.xhtml_an_sprite" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_1903.png" width="600" height="48"
alt="css5 1903" />
<h6 id="ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1759"><span class="label">Figure 19-3.
</span>Sprite of dancing</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We put all of our slightly differing images into a single image called a
*sprite*. Each image in our sprite is a frame in the single animated
image we're creating.

We then create a container element that is the size of a single image of
our sprite, and attach the sprite as the container element's background
image. We animate the `background-position`, using the `steps()` timing
function so we see only a single instance of the changing image of our
sprite at a time. The number of steps in our `steps()` timing function
is the number of occurrences of the image in our sprite. The number of
steps defines how many stops our background image makes to complete a
single animation.

The sprite in [Figure 19-3](#ch19.xhtml_an_sprite){data-type="xref"} has
22 images, each 56 × 100 pixels. The total size of our sprite is 1,232 ×
100 pixels. We set our container to the individual image size: 56 × 100
pixels. We set our sprite as our background image: the initial or
default value of `background-position` is `top left`, which is the same
as `0 0`. Our image will appear at `0 0`, which is a good default.
Browsers that don't support CSS animation, like Opera Mini, will simply
display the first image from our sprite:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.dancer {
  height: 100px;
  width: 56px;
  background-image: url(../images/dancer.png);
  ....
}
```

The trick is to use `steps()` to change the `background-position` value
so that each frame is a view of a separate image within the sprite.
Instead of sliding in the background image from the left, the `steps()`
timing function will pop in the background image in the number of steps
we declared.

So we create an animation that simply changes the left-right value of
the `background-position`. The image is 1,232 pixels wide, so we move
the background image from `0 0`, which is the left top, to `0 -1232px`,
putting the sprite fully outside of our 56 × 100 pixel `<div>` viewport.

The values of `-1232px 0` will move the image completely to the left,
outside of our containing block viewport. It will no longer show up as a
background image in our 100 × 56 pixel `<div>` at the 100% mark unless
`background-repeat` is set to repeat along the x-axis. We don't want
that to happen!

This is what we want:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes dance_in_place {
  from {
      background-position: 0 0;
  }
  to {
      background-position: -1232px 0;
  }
}

.dancer {
  ....
  background-image: url(../images/dancer.png);
  animation-name: dance_in_place;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-timing-function: steps(22, end);
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
```

What may have seemed like a complex animation is very simple: just as in
a flip book, we see one frame of the sprite at a time. Our keyframe
animation simply moves the background.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/sprite.xhtml){.play}

So that covers the first parameter, the number of steps. The second
parameter takes one of a few values: `step-start`, `start`, `step-end`,
`end`, `jump-none`, and `jump-both`. The given value specifies whether
the change for the first step's interval takes place at the beginning or
at the end of a given interval.
([Chapter 18](../Text/ch18.xhtml#x-transitions){data-type="xref"}
describes these values in more detail.)

With the default value, `end`, or its equivalent `step-end`, the change
take place at the end of the first step. In other words, given 200-ms
step lengths, the first change in the animation will not occur until 200
ms into the animation's overall duration. With `start` or `step-start`,
the first change will take place at the beginning of the first step's
interval; that is to say, the instant the animation begins.
[Figure 19-4](#ch19.xhtml_step-timing-change-point){data-type="xref"}
provides a timeline diagram of how the two values work, based on the
following styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes grayfade {
    from {background-color: #BBB;}
    to {background-color: #333;}
}

.slowfader  {animation: grayfade 1s steps(5,end);}
.quickfader {animation: grayfade 1s steps(5,start);}
```

<div id="ch19.xhtml_step-timing-change-point" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1760"><span class="label">Figure 19-4.
</span>Visualizing start and end change points</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The boxes embedded into each timeline represent the background color
during that step interval. Notice that in the `end` timeline, the first
interval is the same as the background before the animation started.
This is because the animation waits until the end of the first frame to
make the color change for the first step (the color between "Step 1" and
["Step 2").]{.keep-together}

In the `start` timeline, on the other hand, the first interval makes
that color change at the start of the interval, instantly switching from
the starting background color to the color between "Step 1" and "Step
2." This is sort of like jumping ahead one interval, an impression
reinforced by the fact that the background color in "Step 2" of the
`end` timeline is the same as that in "Step 1" of the `start` timeline.

A similar effect can be seen at the end of each animation, where the
background in the fifth step of the `start` timeline is the same as the
ending background color. In the `end` timeline, it's the color at the
point between "Step 4" and "Step 5," and doesn't switch to the ending
background color until the end of "Step 5," when the animation is
finished.

The change parameter can be hard to keep straight. If it helps, think of
it this way: in a normal animation direction, the `start` value "skips"
the 0% keyframe, because it makes the first change as soon as the
animation starts, and the `end` value "skips" the `100%`
[keyframe.]{.keep-together}

The `step-start` value is equal to `steps(1, start)`, with only a single
step displaying the `100%` keyframe. The `step-end` value is equal to
`steps(1, end)`, which displays only the `0%`
keyframe.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797008804208 primary=""

### Animating the timing function {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1761}

The `animation-timing-function` is not an animatable property, but it
can be included in keyframes to alter the current timing of the
animation.

Unlike animatable properties, the `animation-timing-function` values
aren't interpolated over time. When included in a keyframe within the
`@keyframes` definition, the timing function for the properties declared
within that same keyframe will change to the new
`animation-timing-function` value when that keyframe is reached, as
shown in [Figure 19-5](#ch19.xhtml_an_timing){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.pencil {animation: W 3s infinite linear;}
@keyframes width {
  0% {
    width: 200px;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
  }
  50% {
    width: 350px;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  }
  100% {
    width: 500px;
  }
}
```

In the preceding example, as shown in
[Figure 19-5](#ch19.xhtml_an_timing){data-type="xref"}, halfway through
the animation, we switch from a linear animation progression for the
`width` property to one that eases in. The `ease-in` timing starts from
the keyframe in which the timing function changes.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/cubicbezierprint2.xhtml){.play}

Specifying the `animation-timing-function` within the `to` or `100%`
keyframe will have no effect on the animation. When included in any
other keyframe, the animation will follow the
`animation-timing-function` specified in that keyframe definition until
it reaches the next keyframe, overriding the element's default or
declared `animation-timing-function`.

<figure>

</span>Changing the animation timing function mid-animation</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If the `animation-timing-function` property is included in a keyframe,
only the properties also included in that keyframe block will have their
timing function impacted. The new timing function will be in play on
that property until the next keyframe containing that property is
reached, at which point it will change to the timing function declared
within that block, or revert back to the original timing function
assigned to that element. Take our `W` animation as an example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes W {
    from     { left: 0; top: 0; }
    25%, 75% { top: 100%; }
    50%      { top: 50%; }
    to       { left: 100%; top: 0; }
}
```

This follows the idea that conceptually, when an animation is set on an
element or pseudo-element, it is as if a set of keyframes is created for
each property present in any of the keyframes, as if an animation is run
independently for each property being animated. It's as if the `W`
animation were made up of two animations that run
simultaneously---`W_part1` and `W_part2`:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes W_part1 {
    from, to { top: 0; }
    25%, 75% { top: 100%; }
    50%      { top: 50%; }
}
@keyframes W_part2 {
    from { left: 0; }
    to   { left: 100%; }
}
```

The `animation-timing-function` that is set on any of the keyframes is
added to the progression of only the properties defined at that
keyframe:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes W {
    from     { left: 0; top: 0; }
    25%, 75% { top: 100%; }
    50%      { animation-timing-function: ease-in; top: 50%; }
    to       { left: 100%; top: 0; }
}
```

The preceding code will change the `animation-timing-function` from
whatever was set on the CSS selector block to `ease-in` for the `top`
property only, not the `left` property, impacting only the `W_part1`
section of our `W` animation, and only from the middle of the animation
to the 75% mark.

However, with the following animation, the `animation-timing-function`
will have no effect, because it's been placed in a keyframe block that
has no property-value [declarations:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes W {
    from     { left: 0; top: 0; }
    25%, 75% { top: 100%; }
    50%      { animation-timing-function: ease-in; }
    50%      { top: 50%; }
    to       { left: 100%; top: 0; }
}
```

How is it useful to change the timing function mid-animation? In the
bounce animation, we had a frictionless environment: the ball bounced
forever, never losing momentum. The ball sped up as it dropped, and
slowed as it rose, because the timing function was inverted from
`ease-in` to `ease-out` by default as the animation proceeded from the
`normal` to `reverse` direction every other iteration.

In reality, friction exists; momentum is lost. Balls will not continue
to bounce indefinitely. If we want our bouncing ball to look natural, we
have to make it bounce less high as it loses energy with each impact. To
do this, we need a single animation that bounces multiple times, losing
momentum on each bounce, while switching between `ease-in` and
`ease-out` at each apex and nadir:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes bounce {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  }
  30% {
    transform: translateY(100px);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  }
  58% {
    transform: translateY(200px);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  }
  80% {
    transform: translateY(300px);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  }
  95% {
    transform: translateY(360px);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  }
  15%, 45%, 71%, 89%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(380px);
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  }
}
```

This animation loses height after a few bounces, eventually stopping.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/ball3.xhtml){.play}

Since this new animation uses a single iteration, we can't rely on
`animation-direction` to change our timing function. We need to ensure
that while each bounce causes the ball to lose momentum, it still speeds
up with gravity and slows down as it reaches its apex. Because we will
have only a single iteration, we control the timing by including
`animation-timing-function` within our keyframes. At every apex, we
switch to `ease-in`, and at every nadir, or bounce, we switch to
`ease-out`.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797008209056 primary=""

When set to the default value of `running`, the animation proceeds as
normal. If set to `paused`, the animation will be, well, paused. When
`paused`, the animation is still applied to the element, just frozen at
the progress it had made before being paused. If stopped mid-iteration,
the properties that were in the process of animating stay at their
mid-iteration values. When set back to `running`{.keep-together}, the
animation restarts from where it left off, as if the "clock" that
controls the animation had stopped and started again.

If the property is set to `paused` during the delay phase of the
animation, the delay clock is also paused and resumes as soon as
`animation-play-state` is set back to running.

This property is useful because, by default, the changes in an animation
apply only during the animation itself. Before the animation starts, the
animation property values aren't applied. Once the animation is done,
the values will all revert to their pre-animation values. Thus, if you
take an element whose background is red, and then animate the background
from green to blue, the background will (by default) stay red until the
animation delay expires, and instantly revert to red after the animation
finishes.

Similarly, an animation will not affect the property values of the
element immediately if a positive `animation-delay` is applied. Rather,
animation property [values]{.keep-together} are applied when the
`animation-delay` expires, at the moment the `animationstart` event is
fired.

With `animation-fill-mode`, we can define how the animation impacts the
element on which it is set before the `animationstart` and after the
`animationend` events are fired. Property values set in the 0% keyframe
can be applied to the element during the expiration of any animation
delay, and property values can persist after the `animationend` event is
fired.

The default value for `animation-fill-mode` is `none`, which means the
animation has no effect when it is not executing. Property values from
the animation's 0% keyframe (or the 100% keyframe in reverse animations)
are not applied to the animated element until the `animation-delay` has
expired, when the `animationstart` event is fired.

When the value is set to `backwards` and the `animation-direction` is
either `normal` or `alternate`, the property values from the `0%`
keyframe are applied immediately, without waiting for the
`animation-delay` time to expire. If the `animation-direction` is either
`reversed` or `reversed-alternate`, the property values from the `100%`
keyframe are applied.

The value of `forwards` means that when the animation is done
executing---that is, has concluded the last part of the last iteration
as defined by the `animation-iteration-count` value, and the
`animationend` event has fired---it continues to apply the values of the
properties as they were when the `animationend` event occurred. If the
`iteration-count` has an integer value, this will be either the `100%`
keyframe, or, if the last iteration was in the reverse direction, the
`0%` keyframe.

The `both` value applies both the `backwards` effect of applying the
property values as soon as the animation is attached to the element,
*and* the `forwards` value of persisting the property values past the
`animationend` event.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/halfiterationforwards.xhtml){.play}

If the `animation-iteration-count` is a float value, and not an integer,
the last iteration will not end on the `0%` or `100%` keyframe; the
animation will instead end its execution partway through an animation
cycle. If the `animation-fill-mode` is set to `forwards` or `both`, the
element maintains the property values it had when the `animationend`
event occurred. For example, if the `animation-iteration-count` is
`6.5`, and the `animation-timing-function` is linear, the `animationend`
event fires and the values of the properties at the 50% mark (whether or
not a 50% keyframe is explicitly declared) will stick, as if the
`animation-play-state` had been set to `pause` at that point.

For example, consider the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@keyframes move_me {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(1000px);
  }
}

.moved {
  transform: translateX(0);
  animation-name: move_me;
  animation-duration: 10s;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-iteration-count: 0.6;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}
```

The animation will go through only 0.6 iterations. Being a linear
10-second animation, it will stop at the 60% mark, 6 seconds into the
animation, when the element is translated 600 pixels to the right. With
`animation-fill-mode` set to `forwards` or `both`, the animation will
stop animating when it is translated 600 pixels to the right, holding
the moved element 600 pixels to the right of its original position. This
will keep it translated indefinitely, or at least until the animation is
detached from the element. Without the `animation-fill-mode`:
`forwards`, the element with class `moved` will pop back to its original
transform: `translateX(0)`, as defined in the moved selector code

The animation shorthand takes as its value all the other preceding
animation properties, including `animation-duration`,
`animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`,
`animation-iteration-count`, `animation-direction`,
`animation-fill-mode`, `animation-play-state`, and `animation-name`. For
example, the following two rules are precisely equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#animated {
  animation: 200ms ease-in 50ms 1 normal running forwards slidedown;
}
#animated {
  animation-name: slidedown;
  animation-duration: 200ms;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in;
  animation-delay: 50ms;
  animation-iteration-count: 1;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  animation-direction: normal;
  animation-play-state: running;
}
```

We didn't have to declare all of the values in the animation shorthand;
any values that aren't declared are set to the default or initial
values. In the preceding example, three of the properties are set to
their default values, so they are not strictly necessary, though
sometimes it's a good idea to write them in as a reminder to future you
(or whoever takes over maintenance of your code).

The order of the shorthand is important in two specific ways. First, two
time properties are permitted, for \<*`animation-duration`*\> and
\<*`animation-delay`*\>. When two are listed, the first is *always* the
duration. The second, if present, is interpreted as [the
delay.]{.keep-together}

Second, the placement of the `animation-name` is also important. If you
use an animation property value as an animation name---which you
shouldn't, but let's say you do---then the `animation-name` should be
placed as the *last* property value in the `animation` shorthand. The
first occurrence of a keyword that is a valid value for any of the other
animation properties, such as `ease` or `running`, is assumed to be part
of the shorthand of the animation property the keyword is associated
with, rather than the `animation-name`. The following rules are
equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#failedAnimation {
    animation: paused 2s;
}

#failedAnimation {
    animation-name: none;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-delay: 0;
    animation-timing-function: ease;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
    animation-fill-mode: none;
    animation-direction: normal;
    animation-play-state: paused;
}
```

This []{#ch19.xhtml_ix_animate_pause_resume primary="animation"
secondary="pausing and resuming" data-type="indexterm"}happens because
`paused` is a valid animation name. While it may seem that the animation
named `paused` with a duration of `2s` is being attached to the element,
that is not what happens. Because words within the shorthand animation
are first checked against possible valid values of all animation
properties other than `animation-name`, `paused` is set as the value of
the `animation-play-state` property. Because no recognizable animation
names are found, the `animation-name` value remains at its default,
`none`.

Here's another example of what you shouldn't do:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#anotherFailedAnimation {
    animation: running 2s ease-in-out forwards;
}

#anotherFailedAnimation {
    animation-name: none;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-delay: 0s;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation-direction: normal;
    animation-play-state: running;
}
```

Here, the author probably has a keyframe animation called `running`. The
browser, however, sees the term and assigns it to the
`animation-play-state` property rather than the `animation-name`
property. With no `animation-name` declared, no animation is attached to
the element.

The way to get around this is shown here:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#aSuccessfulIfInadvisableAnimation {
    animation: running 2s ease-in-out forwards running;
}
```

This will apply the first `running` to `animation-play-state`, and the
second `running` to `animation-name`. Again: this is *not* advised. The
potential for confusion and error is too great.

In light of all this, `animation: 2s 3s 4s;` may seem valid, as if the
following were being set:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#invalidName {
    animation-name: 4s;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-delay: 3s;
}
```

But as mentioned in ["Setting Up Keyframe
Animations"](#ch19.xhtml_setting-up-your-keyframe-animation){data-type="xref"},
`4s` is *not* a valid identifier. Identifiers cannot start with a digit
unless escaped. For this animation to be valid, it would have to be
written as `animation: 2s 3s \4s;`.

To attach multiple animations to a single element or pseudo-element,
comma-separate the animations:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.snowflake {
  animation: 3s ease-in 200ms 32 forwards falling,
             1.5s linear 200ms 64 spinning;
}
```

Each snowflake will fall while spinning for 96 seconds, spinning twice
during each 3-second fall.
[[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"
width="100"}]{.play}](https://meyerweb.github.io/csstdg5figs/19-animation/snowflake.xhtml){.play}
At the end of the last animation cycle, the snowflake will stay fixed on
the `100%` keyframe of the `falling` animation. We declared six of the
eight animation properties for the `falling` animation and five for the
spinning animation, separating the two animations with a
comma.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797007629712 primary=""
startref="ix_animate_pause_resume" data-type="indexterm"}

While you'll most often see the animation name as the first value---it's
easier to read that way, because of the issue with animation property
keywords being valid keyframe identifiers---it is not a best practice.
That is why we put the animation name at [the end.]{.keep-together}

To sum up: using the `animation` shorthand is a fine idea. Just remember
that the placements of the duration, delay, and name within that
shorthand are important, and omitted values will be set to their default
values.

Also note that although `none` is basically the only word that can't be
a valid animation name, using any animation keywords as your identifier
is never a good idea.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797007625936 primary=""

If the `display` property[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797007582928
primary="animation" secondary="iteration control" data-type="indexterm"}
is set to `none` on an element, any animation iterating on that element

the element. Updating the `display` property back to a visible value
will reattach all the animation properties, restarting the animation
from scratch:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.snowflake {
  animation: spin 2s linear 5s 20;
}
```

In this case, the snowflake will spin 20 times; each spin takes 2
seconds, with the first spin starting after 5 seconds. If the snowflake
element's `display` property gets set to `none` after 15 seconds, it
would have completed 5 spins before disappearing (after getting through
the 5-second delay, then executing 5 spins at 2 seconds each). If the
snowflake `display` property changes back to anything other than `none`,
the animation starts from scratch: a 5-second delay will elapse again
before it starts spinning 20 times. It makes no difference how many
animation cycles iterated before it disappeared from view the first
time. [[![](./images/play-icon-round.png){height="100"

    the GPU as described in ["Animation

-   The document or application takes a long time to load, with 11
    seconds between the time the animated elements were drawn to the
    page and the time the JavaScript finished being downloaded, parsed,
    and executed.

Given all that, the delays of the first 11 animations will have expired

The general idea here is to give the browser hints about the sorts of
pre-optimizations it can make if expensive calculations may be required.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch19.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1775}

You should use `will-change` only when you have animation problems that
you have been unable to resolve through other methods, such as
simplifying the animation in subtle but significant ways, and that you
believe pre-optimizations will address. If you try `will-change` and see
no worthwhile improvement, you should remove `will-change` rather than
leaving it in place.
:::

The default value of `auto` leaves optimization work to the browser, as
per usual. The `scroll-position` value says that animation of, or at
least some change of, the document's scroll position is expected. By
default, browsers generally take only the contents of the viewport and a
little of the content to either side of it into account. The
`scroll-position` value might cause the browser to bring more of the
content to either side of the viewport into its layout calculations.
Although this might produce smoother scroll animations, the expanded
scope could easily slow the rendering of the content visible in the
viewport.

With `contents`, the browser is told to expect animation of the
element's contents. This is most likely to cause browsers to reduce or
eliminate caching of the layout of the viewport's contents. This would
require the browser to recompute the layout of the page from scratch
every frame. Having to constantly recompute the page layout could slow
the rendering of the page to slower than 60 frames per second, which is
the benchmark that browser makers usually try to meet. On the other
hand, if the contents will be changed and animated quite a lot, telling
the browser to cache less can make sense. Again, try this only if you
already know the animations are overtaxing the browser---never assume
ahead of time.

It's also possible to tell the browser which properties to watch out for
by using a \<*`custom-ident`*\>, which, in this case, is a fancy way of
saying "properties." For example, if you have a complicated animation
set that changes position, filter, and text shadow, and they're proving
to be slow or stuttery, you could try this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
will-change: top, left, filter, text-shadow;
```

If this smooths out the animation, it's worth removing one property at a
time to see if the smoothness remains. You might, for example, discover
that removing the `top` and `left` properties doesn't affect the new
smoothness, but removing either `filter` or `text-shadow` causes the
stuttering to return. In that case, keep it at
`will-change: filter, text-shadow`.

Also keep in mind that listing a shorthand property like `font` or
`background` causes all of the longhand properties to be considered
changeable. Thus, the following two rules are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.textAn {will-change: font;}

.textAn {will-change: font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-style,
     font-variant, line-height;}
```

This is why, in nearly any case, a shorthand property should not be
listed in `will-change`. Instead, identify the longhand properties being
animated, and list those.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797007435264 primary=""

As we hope this chapter shows, animations can be powerful additions to a
user interface, as well as to decorative parts of a design. Whether an
animation is simple, complex, short, or lengthy, all these aspects and
more are in your hands.[]{#ch19.xhtml_idm45797007426416 primary=""

Always exercise caution, as animation can affect some users negatively,
whether they have vestibular disorders or simply are sensitive to
motion. Fortunately, `prefers-reduced-motion` is available to reduce or
eliminate animations for those who do not want them.

The []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007372064 primary="blur radius"
secondary="filter-effects" data-type="indexterm"}value syntax permits a
space-separated list of filter functions, with each filter applied in
sequence. Thus, given the declaration `filter: opacity(0.5) blur(1px);`,
the opacity is applied to the element, and the semitransparent result is
then blurred. If the order is reversed, so too is the order of
application: the fully opaque element is blurred, and the resulting blur
made semitransparent.

The CSS []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007369936 primary="input image"
data-type="indexterm"}specification talks of "input images" when
discussing `filter`, but this doesn't mean `filter` is used only on
images. Any HTML element can be filtered, and all graphic SVG elements
can be filtered. The *input image* is a visual copy of the rendered
element *before* it is filtered. Filters are applied to this input, and
the final filtered result is then rendered to the display medium (e.g.,
the device display).

All the values permitted (save `url()`) are function values, with the
permitted value types for each function being dependent on the function
in question. We've grouped these functions into a few broad categories
for ease of understanding.

that their names directly describe---blurring, drop shadows, and opacity

`blur(` \<*`length`*\> `)`

    primary="filters" secondary="blurring"
    data-type="indexterm"}element's contents by using a Gaussian blur
    whose standard deviation is defined by the \<*`length`*\> value
    supplied, where a value of `0` leaves the element unchanged.
    Negative lengths are not permitted.

`opacity(` \[ \<*`number`*\> \| \<*`percentage`*\> \] `)`

:   Applies a []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007355920 primary="filters"
    secondary="opacity"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007354912
    primary="opacity() function" data-type="indexterm"}transparency
    filter to the element in a manner very similar to the `opacity`
    property, where the value `0` yields a completely transparent
    element and a value of `1` or `100%` leaves the element unchanged.
    Negative values are not permitted. Values greater than `1` and
    `100%` are permitted, but are clipped to be `1` or `100%` for the
    purposes of computing the final value.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1781}

The specification makes clear that `filter: opacity()` is *not* meant to
be a replacement or shorthand for the `opacity` property, and in fact
both can be applied to the same element, resulting in a sort of
double-transparency.

    same as for the property `box-shadow`, which means that while the
    first two \<*`length`*\> values can be negative, the third (which
    defines the blur) cannot. Unlike box-shadow, though, the `inset`
    value is not permitted. To apply multiple drop shadows, provide
    multiple space-separated `drop-shadow()` functions; unlike
    `box-shadow`, comma-separated shadows don't work here. If no
    \<*`color`*\> value is supplied, the used color is the same as the
    computed value of the `color` property for the element.

[Figure 20-1](#ch20.xhtml_filter-basic-effects){data-type="xref"} shows
some effects of these filter functions.

Before we go on, two things deserve further exploration. The first is
how `drop-shadow()` really operates. Just by looking at
[Figure 20-1](#ch20.xhtml_filter-basic-effects){data-type="xref"}, it's
easy to get the impression that drop shadows are bound to the element
box, because of the boxlike nature of the drop shadows shown there. But
that's just because the image used to illustrate filters is a PNG, which
is to say a raster image, and more importantly one that doesn't have any
alpha channel. The white parts of the image are opaque white, in other
words.

If the image has transparent bits, `drop-shadow()` will use those in
computing the shadow. To see what this means, consider
[Figure 20-2](#ch20.xhtml_filter-basic-effects-dropshadows){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_filter-basic-effects-dropshadows" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1783"><span class="label">Figure 20-2.
</span>Drop shadows and alpha channels</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The other thing to point out in
[Figure 20-2](#ch20.xhtml_filter-basic-effects-dropshadows){data-type="xref"}
is the last image has two drop shadows. This was accomplished as
follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.5em yellow) drop-shadow(0.5em 0.75em 30px gray);
```

Any number of filters can be chained together like this. To pick another
example, you could write the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
filter: blur(3px) drop-shadow(0.5em 0.75em 30px gray) opacity(0.5);
```

That would get you a blurry, drop-shadowed, half-opaque element. It
might not be the most reader-friendly effect for text, but it's possible
nonetheless. This function-chaining is possible with all `filter`
functions, both those you've seen and those to
come.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007253552 primary=""

functions alter the colors present in the element. This can be as simple
as leaching out the colors, or as complex as shifting all the colors by
way of an angle value.

Note that for the first three of the four following functions, all of
which accept either a \<*`number`*\> or \<*`percentage`*\>, negative

    and B values for a given color are inverted by subtracting them from
    255 (in 0--255 notation) or from 100% (in 0%--100% notation). For
    example, a pixel with the color `rgb(255 128 55)` will be rendered
    as `rgb(0 127 200)`; a different pixel with the value
    `rgb(75% 57.2% 23%)` will become `rgb(25% 42.8% 77%)`. A value of
    `0` leaves the element unchanged, and a value of `1` or `100%`
    results in a fully inverted element. A value of `0.5` or `50%` stops
    the inversion of each color at the midpoint of the color space,

    (a full single rotation) will also present an apparently unchanged
    element, though the rotation-angle value is maintained. Values above
    `360deg` are permitted. Negative values are also permitted, and
    cause a counterclockwise rotation as opposed to the clockwise
    rotation caused by positive values. (In other words, the rotation is
    "compass-style," with 0° at the top and increasing angle values in
    the clockwise direction.)[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007198816 primary=""

While the following `filter` functions also manipulate color, they do so
in closely related ways, and are a familiar grouping to anyone who's
worked with images, particularly photographic images. For all these
functions, values greater than `1` and `100%` are permitted, but are
clipped to be `1` or `100%` for the purposes of computing the final
value:

`brightness(` \[ \<*`number`*\> \| \<*`percentage`*\> \] `)`

:   Alters the []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007185776 primary="filters"
    secondary="brightness"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007184800
    primary="brightness() function" data-type="indexterm"}brightness of
    the element's colors. A value of `0` leaves the element a solid
    black, and a value of `1` or `100%` leaves it unchanged. Values
    above `1` and `100%` yield colors brighter than the input element,
    and can eventually reach a state of solid white.

`contrast(` \[ \<*`number`*\> \| \<*`percentage`*\> \] `)`

:   Alters the []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007178480 primary="filters"
    secondary="contrast"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007177504
    primary="contrast() function" data-type="indexterm"}contrast of the
    element's colors. The higher the contrast, the more colors are
    differentiated from each other; the lower the contrast, the more
    they converge on each other. A value of `0` leaves the element a
    solid gray, and a value of `1` or `100%` leaves it unchanged. Values
    above `1` and `100%` yield colors with greater contrast than is
    present in the input element.

`saturate(` \[ \<*`number`*\> \| \<*`percentage`*\> \] `)`

:   Alters the []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007171584 primary="filters"
    secondary="saturation"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007170192
    primary="saturate() function" data-type="indexterm"}saturation of
    the element's colors. The more saturated an element's colors, the
    more intense they become; the less saturated they are, the more
    muted they appear. A value of `0` leaves the element completely
    unsaturated, making it effectively grayscale, whereas a value of `1`
    or `100%` leaves the element unchanged. Similar to `brightness()`,
    `saturate()` permits *and* acts upon values greater than `1` or
    `100%`; such values result in *supersaturation*.

Examples of the preceding `filter` functions are shown in

## SVG Filters {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1788}

The []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_svg_filter primary="SVG format"
secondary="filtering" data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_ix_filter_svg
primary="filters" secondary="SVG" data-type="indexterm"}last `filter`
value type is a function of a familiar kind: the `url()` value type.
This allows you to point to a (potentially very complicated) filter
defined in SVG, whether it's embedded in the document or stored in an
external file.

This takes the []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007155472 primary="url() function"
data-type="indexterm"}form `url(<`*`uri`*`>)`, where the \<*`uri`*\>
value points to a filter defined using SVG syntax, specifically the
`<filter>` element. This can be a reference to a single SVG image that
contains only a filter, such as `url(wavy.svg)`, or it can be a pointer
to an identified filter embedded in an SVG image, such as
`url(filters.svg#wavy)`. The advantage of the latter pattern is that a
single SVG file can define multiple filters, thus consolidating all your
filtering into one file for easy loading, caching, and
[referencing.]{.keep-together}

If a `url()` function points to a nonexistent file, or points to an SVG
fragment that is not a `<filter>` element, the function is invalid and
the *entire* function list is ignored (thus rendering the `filter`
declaration invalid).

Examining the full range of filtering possibilities in SVG is well
beyond the scope of this book, but let's just say that the power of the
offered features is substantial. A few simple examples of SVG filtering
are shown in
[Figure 20-5](#ch20.xhtml_filter-svg-effects){data-type="xref"}, with
brief captions to indicate the kinds of operations the filters were
built to create. (The actual CSS used to apply these filters looks like
`filter: url(filters.svg#rough)`.)

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_filter-svg-effects" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_2005.png" width="600" height="274"

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1789"><span class="label">Figure 20-5.
</span>SVG filter effects</h6>
</div>
</figure>

It's easily possible to put every last bit of filtering you do into SVG,
including replacements for every other `filter` function you've seen.
(In fact, all the other `filter` functions are defined by the
specification as literal SVG filters, to give a precise rendering target
for implementors.) Remember, however, that you can chain CSS functions
together. Thus, you might define a specular-highlight filter in SVG, and
modify it with blurring or grayscale functions as needed. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.logo {filter: url(/assets/filters.svg#spotlight);}
img.logo.print {filter: url(/assets/filters.svg#spotlight) grayscale(100%);}
img.logo.censored {filter: url(/assets/filters.svg#spotlight) blur(3px);}
```

Always keep in mind that the filter functions are applied in order.
That's why the `grayscale()` and `blur()` functions come after the
`url()`-imported spotlight filter. If they were reversed, the logos
would be made grayscale or blurred first, and then have the spotlight
filter applied afterward.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007093568 primary=""

In addition to []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007088288 primary="compositing"
seealso="blending" data-type="indexterm"}filtering, CSS enables you to
determine how elements are *composited* together. Take, for example, two
elements that partially overlap because of positioning. By default, the
element in front, if fully opaque, completely obscures the one behind,
wherever they overlap. If the one in front is semitransparent, the
element in back is partially visible.

This is sometimes []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007079600
primary="simple alpha compositing" data-type="indexterm"}called *simple
alpha compositing*, in that you can see whatever is behind an element as
long as some (or all) of it has alpha channel values less than `1`.
Think of how you can see the background through an element with
`opacity: 0.5`, or in the areas of a PNG or GIF that are set to be
transparent. That's simple alpha compositing.

But if you're []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_blending_ch20 primary="blending"
data-type="indexterm"}familiar with image-editing programs like
Photoshop or GIMP, you know that overlapping image layers can be blended
together in a variety of ways. CSS has the same ability. CSS has two
blending strategies (at least as of late 2022): blending entire elements
with whatever is behind them, and blending the background layers of a
single element together. While similar to filter effects in many ways,
blending mode values are predefined---they don't accept a
parameter---and while both filter effects and blend modes support
multiple values, the properties that support blend modes use a
comma-separated list of values instead of a space-separated list. (This
inconsistency in value syntaxes is rooted deep in the history of CSS,
and is something we just have to live with for the time being.)

The CSS specification indicates that this property "defines the formula
that must be used to mix the colors with the backdrop." The element is
blended with whatever is behind it (the "backdrop"), whether that's
pieces of another element, or just the background of an ancestor element
such as the `<body>`.

The default value, `normal`, shows the element's pixels as is, without
any mixing with the backdrop, except where the alpha channel is less
than `1`. This is the simple alpha compositing mentioned previously.
It's what we're all used to, which is why it's the default value.
[Figure 20-6](#ch20.xhtml_blending-elements-normal){data-type="xref"}
shows a few examples.

For the []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007044960
primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="non-mode categories"
data-type="indexterm"}rest of the `mix-blend-mode` keywords, we've
grouped them into a few categories. Let's also nail down a few
definitions we'll be using in the blend mode descriptions:

Foreground

:   The element that has `mix-blend-mode` applied to it.

Backdrop

:   Whatever is behind an element. This can be other elements, the
    background of an ancestor element, and so on.

Pixel component

:   The color component of a given pixel: R, G, and B.

If it helps, think of the foreground and backdrop as layers atop each
other in an image-editing program. With `mix-blend-mode`, you can change
the blend mode applied to the top element (the foreground).

::: {#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007037072 .sect3}
### Darken, lighten, difference, and exclusion {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1794}

The following blend modes might be called *simple-math modes*---they
achieve their effect by directly comparing values in some way, or using
simple addition and subtraction to modify pixels:

`darken`

:   Each []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007033328
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="darken blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007032320
    primary="darken blend mode" data-type="indexterm"}pixel in the
    foreground is compared with the corresponding pixel in the backdrop,
    and for each of the R, G, and B values (the pixel components), the
    smaller of the two is kept. Thus, if the foreground pixel has a
    value corresponding to `rgb(91 164 22)` and the backdrop pixel is
    `rgb(102 104 255)`, the resulting pixel will be `rgb(91 104 22)`.

`lighten`

:   This []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007028608 primary="lighten blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007027904
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="lighten blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}blend is the inverse of `darken`: when
    comparing the R, G, and B components of a foreground pixel and its
    corresponding backdrop pixel, the larger of the two values is kept.
    Thus, if the foreground pixel has a value corresponding to
    `rgb(91 164 22)` and the backdrop pixel is `rgb(102 104 255)`, the
    resulting pixel will be `rgb(102 164 255)`.

`difference`

:   The R, G, and B []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007023824
    primary="difference blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007023088
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="difference blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}components of each pixel in the foreground are
    compared to the corresponding pixel in the backdrop, and the
    absolute value of subtracting one from the other is the final
    result. Thus, if the foreground pixel has a value corresponding to
    `rgb(91 164 22)` and the backdrop pixel is `rgb(102 104 255)`, the
    resulting pixel will be `rgb(11 60 233)`. If one of the pixels is
    white, the resulting pixel will be the inverse of the nonwhite
    pixel. If one of the pixels is black, the result will be exactly the
    same as the nonblack pixel.

`exclusion`

:   This []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007019360 primary="exclusion blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797007018240
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="exclusion blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}blend is a milder version of `difference`.
    Rather than *\| back* -- *fore*, the formula is *back* + *fore* --
    (2 × *back* × *fore*), where *back* and *fore* are values in the
    range 0 to 1. For example, an exclusion calculation of an orange
    (`rgb(100% 50% 0%)`) and a medium gray (`rgb(50% 50% 50%)`) will
    yield `rgb(50% 50% 50%)`. For the green component, as an example,
    the math is 0.5 + 0.5 -- (2 × 0.5 × 0.5), which reduces to 0.5,
    corresponding to `50%`. Compare this to `difference`, where the
    result would be `rgb(50% 0% 50%)`, since each component is the
    absolute value of subtracting one from the other.

This last definition highlights that, for all blend modes, the actual
values being operated on are in the range 0--1. The previous examples
showing values like `rgb(11 60 233)` are normalized from the 0--1 range.
In other words, given the example of applying the `difference` blend
mode to `rgb(91 164 22)` and `rgb(102 104 255)`, the actual operation is
as follows:

1.  `rgb(91 164 22)` is *R* = 91 ÷ 255 = 0.357; *G* = 164 ÷ 255 = 0.643;
    *B* = 22 ÷ 255 = 0.086. Similarly, `rgb(102 104 255)` corresponds to
    *R* = 0.4; *G* = 0.408; *B* = 1.

2.  Each component is subtracted from the corresponding component, and
    the absolute value taken. Thus, *R* = \| 0.357 -- 0.4 \| = 0.043;
    *G* = \| 0.643 -- 0.408 \| = 0.235; *B* = \| 1 -- 0.086 \| = 0.914.
    This could be expressed as `rgba(4.3% 23.5% 91.4%)`, or (by
    multiplying each component by 255) as `rgb(11 60 233)`.

From all this, you can perhaps understand why the full formulas are not
written out for every blend mode we cover. If you're interested in the
fine details, each blend mode's formula is provided in the ["Compositing
and Blending Level
2"](https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing/#blendingseparable)

### Multiply, screen, and overlay {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1796}

The following blend modes might be called the *multiplication
modes*---they achieve their effect by multiplying values together:

`multiply`

:   Each []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006991600
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="multiply blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006990592
    primary="multiply blend mode" data-type="indexterm"}pixel component
    in the foreground is multiplied by the corresponding pixel component
    in the backdrop. This yields a darker version of the foreground,
    modified by what is underneath. This blend mode is *symmetric*, in
    that the result will be exactly the same even if you were to swap
    the foreground with the backdrop.

`screen`

:   Each []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006987616
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="screen blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006986640
    primary="screen blend mode" data-type="indexterm"}pixel component in
    the foreground is inverted (see `invert` in ["Color
    Filtering"](#ch20.xhtml_csstdg4-color-filtering){data-type="xref"}),
    multiplied by the inverse of the corresponding pixel component in
    the backdrop, and the result inverted again. This yields a lighter
    version of the foreground, modified by what is underneath. Like
    `multiply`, `screen` is symmetric.

`overlay`

:   This []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006982128
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="overlay blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006981152
    primary="overlay blend mode" data-type="indexterm"}blend is a
    combination of `multiply` and `screen`. For foreground pixel
    components darker than 0.5 (50%), the `multiply` operation is
    carried out; for foreground pixel components whose values are above
    0.5, `screen` is used. This makes the dark areas darker, and the
    light areas lighter. This blend mode is *not* symmetric, because
    swapping the foreground for the backdrop would mean a different
    pattern of light and dark, and thus a different pattern of
    multiplying versus screening.

### Hard and soft light {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1798}

The following blend modes are covered here because the first is closely
related to a previous blend mode, and the other is just a muted version
of the first:

`hard-light`

:   This []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006970320
    primary="hard-light blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006969584
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="hard-light blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}blend is the inverse of `overlay` blending.
    Like `overlay`, it's a combination of `multiply` and `screen`, but
    the determining layer is the backdrop. Thus, for backdrop pixel
    components darker than 0.5 (50%), the `multiply` operation is
    carried out; for backdrop pixel components lighter than 0.5,
    `screen` is used. This makes it appear somewhat as if the foreground
    is being projected onto the backdrop with a projector that employs a
    harsh light.

`soft-light`

:   This []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006964288
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="soft-light blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006963280
    primary="soft-light blend mode" data-type="indexterm"}blend is a
    softer version of `hard-light`. This mode uses the same operation
    but is muted in its effects. The intended appearance is as if the
    foreground is being projected onto the backdrop with a projector
    that employs a diffuse light.

### Color dodge and burn {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1800}

Color dodging and burning---terms that come from old darkroom techniques
performed on chemical film stock---are meant to lighten or darken a
picture with a minimum of change to the colors themselves. These modes
are as follows:

`color-dodge`

:   Each []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006954848
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="color-dodge blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006953840
    primary="color-dodge blend mode" data-type="indexterm"}pixel
    component in the foreground is inverted, and the component of the
    corresponding backdrop pixel component is divided by the inverted
    foreground value. This yields a brightened backdrop unless the
    foreground value is `0`, in which case the backdrop value is
    unchanged.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

`color-burn`

:   This []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006950496
    primary="color-burn blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006949760
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="color-burn blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}blend is a reverse of `color-dodge`: each
    pixel component in the backdrop is inverted, the inverted backdrop
    value is divided by the unchanged value of the corresponding
    foreground pixel component, and the result is then inverted. This
    yields a result where the darker the backdrop pixel, the more its
    color will burn through the foreground pixel.

### Hue, saturation, luminosity, and color {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1802}

The final four blend modes are different from those we've shown before,
because they do *not* perform operations on the R/G/B pixel components.
Instead, they perform operations to combine the hue, saturation,
luminosity, and color of the foreground and backdrop in different ways.
These modes are as follows:

`hue`

:   For []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006939856 primary="hue blend mode"

    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="hue blend mode"

    saturation levels of the backdrop with the hue angle of the
    foreground.

`saturation`

    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="saturation blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}each pixel, combines the hue angle and
    luminosity level of the backdrop with the saturation level of the
    foreground.

`color`

:   For []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006933168 primary="color blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006932432
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="color blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}each pixel, combines the luminosity level of
    the backdrop with the hue angle and saturation level of the
    foreground.

`luminosity`

:   For []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006929824 primary="luminosity blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006929088
    primary="mix-blend-mode property" secondary="luminosity blend mode"
    data-type="indexterm"}each pixel, combines the hue angle and
    saturation level of the backdrop with the luminosity level of the
    foreground.

These blend modes can be a lot harder to grasp without busting out raw
formulas, and even those can be confusing if you aren't familiar with
how things like saturation and luminosity levels are determined. If you
don't feel like you quite have a handle on how these modes work, the
best solution is to practice with a bunch of images and simple [color
patterns.]{.keep-together}

Two points to note:

-   Remember that an element always blends with its backdrop. If there
    are other elements behind an element, it will blend with them; if
    there's a patterned background on the parent element, the blending
    will be done against that pattern.

-   Changing the opacity of a blended element will change the outcome,
    though not always in the way you might expect. For example, if an
    element with `mix-blend-mode: difference` is also given
    `opacity: 0.8`, the difference calculations will be scaled by 80%.
    More precisely, a scaling factor of 0.8 will be applied to the
    color-value calculations. This can cause some operations to trend
    toward flat middle gray and others to shift the color
    changes.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006920032 primary=""

We won't go through an exhaustive list of all the blend modes and what
they mean, because we did that in ["Blending
Elements"](#ch20.xhtml_blending-elements){data-type="xref"}. What they
meant there, they mean here.

The difference is that when it comes to blending multiple background
images, they're blended with one other against an empty
background---that is, a completely transparent, uncolored backdrop. They
do *not* blend with the backdrop of the element, except as directed by
`mix-blend-mode`. To see what that means, consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {background-image:
        url(star.svg),
        url(diamond.png),
        linear-gradient(135deg, #F00, #AEA);
    background-blend-mode: color-burn, luminosity, darken;}
```

Here we have three background images, each with its own blend mode.
These are blended together into a single result, shown in
[Figure 20-12](#ch20.xhtml_blending-backgrounds-threebgs){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_blending-backgrounds-threebgs" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1806"><span class="label">Figure 20-12.
</span>Three backgrounds blended together</h6>
</div>
</figure>

So far, fine. Here's the kicker: the result will be the same regardless
of what might appear behind the element. We can change the parent's
background to white, gray, fuchsia, or a lovely pattern of repeating
gradients, and in every case those three blended backgrounds will look
exactly the same, pixel for pixel. They're blended in *isolation*, a
term we'll return to shortly. We can see the previous example
([Figure 20-12](#ch20.xhtml_blending-backgrounds-threebgs){data-type="xref"})
sitting atop a variety of backgrounds in
[Figure 20-13](#ch20.xhtml_blending-backgrounds-color-transparent){data-type="xref"}.

</span>Blending with color versus transparency</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Like multiple blended elements stacked atop one another, the blending of
background layers works from the back to the front. Thus, if you have
two background images over a solid background color, the background
layer in the back is blended with the background color, and then the
frontmost layer is blended with the result of the first blend. Consider
the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.bbm {background-image:
        url(star.svg),
        url(diamond.png);
    background-color: goldenrod;
    background-blend-mode: color-burn, luminosity;}
```

Given these styles, *diamond.png* is blended with the background color
`goldenrod` using the `luminosity` blend. Once that's done, *star.svg*
is blended with the results of the diamond-goldenrod blend using a
`color-burn` blend.

Although it's true that the background layers are blended in isolation,
they're also part of an element that may have its own blending rules via
`mix-blend-mode`. Thus, the final result of the isolated background
blend may be blended with the element's backdrop after all. Given the
following styles, the first example's background will sit atop the
element's backdrop, but the rest will end up blended with it in some
fashion, as illustrated in
[Figure 20-14](#ch20.xhtml_blending-backgrounds-backdrops){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}

Throughout this section, we've touched on the concept of blending in
isolation as a thing that backgrounds naturally do. Elements, on the
other hand, do not naturally blend in isolation. As you'll see next,
that behavior can be changed.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006679808 primary=""

you.]{.keep-together}

This pretty much does exactly what it says: it either defines an element
to create an isolated blending context, or not. Given the following
styles, then, we get the result shown in
[Figure 20-15](#ch20.xhtml_blending-isolation){data-type="xref"}:

</span>Blending in isolation, and not</h6>
</div>

Take particular note of where `isolation` is applied, and where
`mix-blend-mode` is applied. The image is given the blend mode, but the
containing element (in this case, a paragraph) is set to isolation
blending. It's done this way because you want the parent (or ancestor
element) to be isolated from the rest of the document, in terms of how
its descendant elements are blended. So if you want an element to blend
in isolation, look for an ancestor element to set to
`isolation: isolate`.

An interesting wrinkle arises in all of this: any element that
establishes a stacking context is automatically isolated, regardless of
the `isolation` value. For example, if you transform an element by using
the `transform` property, it will become isolated.

The complete list of stacking-context-establishing conditions, as of
late 2022, is as follows:

-   The root element (e.g., `<html>`)

-   Making an element a flex or grid item *and* setting its `z-index` to
    anything other than `auto`

-   Positioning an element with `relative` or `absolute` *and* setting
    its `z-index` to anything other than `auto`

-   Positioning an element with `fixed` or `sticky`, regardless of its
    `z-index` value

-   Setting `opacity` to anything other than `1`

-   Setting `transform` to anything other than `none`

-   Setting `mix-blend-mode` to anything other than `normal`

-   Setting `filter` to anything other than `none`

-   Setting `perspective` to anything other than `none`

-   Setting `mask-image`, `mask-border`, or `mask` to anything other
    than `none`

-   Setting `isolation` to `isolate`

-   Setting `contain` to a value that contains `layout` or `paint`

-   Applying `will-change` to any of the other properties, even if they
    are not actually changed

Thus, if you have a group of elements that are blended together and then
blended with their shared backdrop, and you then transition the group's
`opacity` from `1` to `0`, the group will suddenly become isolated
during the transition. This might have no visual impact, depending on
the original set of blends, but it very well
might.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006525280 primary=""

```
The default, `none`, means no containment is indicated and so no
optimization hints are given. Each of the other values has its own
peculiar effects, so we'll examine them in turn.

Perhaps the simplest of the four alternatives is `contain: paint`. With
this value set, the painting of an element is confined to its overflow
box, so that any descendants cannot be painted outside that area. This
is in many ways similar to `overflow: hidden`. The difference here is
that with paint containment enabled, there will never be a way to reveal
the unpainted portions of the element and its descendants; thus, no
scrollbar, click-dragging, or other user action will bring the unpainted
content into view. This allows browsers to completely ignore the layout
and painting of elements that are entirely offscreen or otherwise not
visible, since their descendants cannot be displayed either.

A step up from that in complexity is `contain: style`. With the `style`
value, things like counter increments and resets, and quotation-mark
nesting, are calculated within the contained element as though no such
styles exist outside it, and furthermore, they cannot leave the element
to affect other elements. []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006498304
primary="scoped styles" data-type="indexterm"}This sounds like it
creates *scoped styles*, where you can have a set of styles just apply
to a subtree of the DOM, but it doesn't, really. It does that only for
things like counters and quote nesting.

A more impactful option is `contain: size`. This value makes it so that
an element is laid out without checking to see how its descendant
elements might affect its layout, and furthermore, its size is
calculated as though it has no descendants, which means it will have
zero height. It's also treated as though it has no intrinsic aspect
ratio, even if the element is an `<img>`, `<svg>`, form input, or
something else that would ordinarily have an intrinsic aspect ratio.

</span>Examples of size containment</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Maybe that's interesting, but is it useful? To pick one example, it
could be when JavaScript is used to size elements based on the sizes of
their ancestors, rather than the other way around (*container
queries* by another name) in order to prevent layout loops. It could
also be applied to elements known to be offscreen at page render, in
order to minimize the amount of work required by the browser.

The last kind of containment is invoked with `contain: layout`. This
allows fragments to come into it, but no fragments to escape, as might
be possible with proposed features like CSS Regions. When `layout` is
set, the internal layout of the element is isolated from the rest of the
page. This means that nothing in the element affects anything outside
the element and that nothing outside the element affects the element's
internal layout.

More than one of these keywords can be used in a single rule, such as
`contain: size paint`. This leads to the last two possible keywords,
`content` and `strict`. The `content` keyword is shorthand for
`layout paint style`, and `strict` is shorthand for
`size layout paint style`. In other words, `content` contains everything
but size, and `strict` contains in all possible ways.

An important caveat is that `contain` can apply to elements with the
following exceptions: elements that do not generate a box (e.g.,
`display: none` or `display: contents`), internal table boxes that
aren't table cells, internal Ruby boxes, and nonatomic inline-level
boxes can't be set to `paint`, `size`, or `layout`. Furthermore,
elements that have an inside display type of `table` (e.g., `<table>`)
can't be set to `size`. Any element can be set to `style`.

We have one more caveat to mention: some forms of containment can be
invoked even without `contain`. For example, `overflow: hidden` will
have effectively the same result as `contain: paint`, even though
`contain: none` may apply to the same
element.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006397648 primary=""
startref="ix_contain_prop" data-type="indexterm"}

All this []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006365216
primary="content-visibility property" data-type="indexterm"}leads us to
the other containment property, `content-visibility`, which effectively
invokes kinds of containment, as well as potentially suppressing the
rendering of an element's contents.

In the default case, `visible`, the contents of an element are shown as
normal.

If the `hidden` value is used, none of the element's contents are
rendered, and they do not participate in the sizing of the element, as
if all the contents (including any text outside of descendant elements)
had been set to `display: none`. Furthermore, the suppressed content
should not be available to things such as page search and tab-order
navigation, and should not be selectable (as with mouse click-and-drag)
or focusable.

If `auto` is used, paint, style, and layout containment are enabled, as
if having declared `contain: content`. The content may be skipped by the
user agent or may not; most likely, it will be if the element is
offscreen or otherwise not visible, but that's up to the user agent. The
contents in this case *are* available to page search and tab-order
navigation, and can be selected and focused.

To []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_shape_out_prop primary="shape-outside property"

```
With `none`, there's no shaping except the margin box of the float
itself---same as it ever was. That's straightforward and boring. Time
for the good stuff.

Let's start with using an image to define the float shape, as it's both
the simplest and (in many ways) the most exciting. Say we have an image
of a crescent moon, and we want the content to flow around the visible
parts of it. If that image has transparent parts, as in a GIF or a PNG,
then the content will flow into those transparent parts, as shown in
[Figure 20-17](#ch20.xhtml_using_an_image_to_define_fig){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.lunar {float: left; shape-outside: url(moon.png);}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<img class="lunar" src="moon.png" alt="a crescent moon">
```

In most cases, when you have a floated image, you'll just use that same
image as its shape. You don't have to---you can always load a second,
different image to create a float shape that doesn't match the visible
image---but using a single image as both the float and its shape is by
far the most common use case. We'll talk in the following sections about
how to push the content away from the visible parts of the image, and
how to vary the transparency threshold that determines the shape; but
for now, let's just savor the power this affords us.

<figure>

</div>
</figure>

One point needs to be clarified at this stage: the content will flow
into transparent parts to which it has "direct access," for lack of a
better term. That is, the content doesn't flow to both the left and
right of the image in
[Figure 20-17](#ch20.xhtml_using_an_image_to_define_fig){data-type="xref"},
but just the right side. That's the side that faces the content, it
being a left-floated image. If we right-floated the image, the content
would flow into the transparent areas on the image's left side. This is
illustrated in
[Figure 20-18](#ch20.xhtml_an_image_float_shape_fig){data-type="xref"}
(with the text right-aligned to make the effect more obvious):

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {text-align: right;}
img.lunar {float: right; shape-outside: url(moon.png);}
```

Always remember that the image has to have actual areas of transparency
to create a shape. With an image format like JPEG, or even if you have a
GIF or PNG with no alpha channel, the shape will be a rectangle, exactly
as if you'd used `shape-outside: none`.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006219696

section, it's possible to use an image with transparent areas to define
the float shape. Any part of the image that isn't fully transparent
creates the shape. That's the default behavior, anyway, but you can
modify it with `shape-image-threshold`.

This property lets you decide what level of transparency determines an
area where content can flow, or, conversely, what level of opacity
defines the float shape. Thus, with `shape-image-threshold: 0.5`, any
part of the image with more than 50% transparency can allow content to
flow into it, and any part of the image with less than 50% transparency
is part of the float shape. This is illustrated in
[Figure 20-19](#ch20.xhtml_using_image_opacity_to_define){data-type="xref"}.

If you set the value of the `shape-image-threshold` property to `1.0`
(or just `1`), no part of the image can be part of the shape, so there
won't be one, and the content will flow over the entire float.

On the other hand, a value of `0.0` (or just `0`) will make any
nontransparent part of the image the float shape, as if this property
was not even set. Furthermore, any value below 0 is reset to `0.0`, and
any above one is reset to `1.0`.

## Using Inset Shapes {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1825}

Now let's turn []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_shape_float_inset

primary="inset shapes, for floated elements" data-type="indexterm"}back
to the \<*`basic-shape`*\> and \<*`shape-box`*\> values. A basic shape
is one of the following types:

-   `inset()`

-   `circle()`

-   `ellipse()`

-   `polygon()`

In addition, the \<*`shape-box`*\> can be one of these types:

-   `margin-box`

-   `border-box`

-   `padding-box`

-   `content-box`

These shape boxes indicate the outermost limits of the shape. You can
use them on their own, as illustrated in
[Figure 20-20](#ch20.xhtml_basic_shape_boxes_fig){data-type="xref"},
where the images have some padding in which a dark background color can
be seen, then a thick border, and finally some (invisible, as always)
margins.

</span>The basic shape boxes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The default shape box is the margin box, which makes sense, since that's
what float boxes use when they aren't being shaped. You can use a shape
box in combination with a basic shape; thus, for example, you could
declare `shape-outside: inset(10px) border-box`. The syntax for each of
the basic shapes is different, so we'll take them in turn.

If you're used to []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006149120
primary="distance values" data-type="indexterm"}working with border
images, inset shapes should seem familiar. Even if you aren't, the
syntax isn't too complicated. You define distances to move inward from
each side of the shape box, using from one to four length or percentage
values, with an optional corner-rounding value.

To pick a simple case, suppose we want to shrink the shape 2.5 em inside
the shape box:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: inset(2.5em);
```

Four offsets are created, each 2.5 em inward from the outside edge of
the shape box. In this case, the shape box is the margin box, since we
haven't altered it. If we wanted the shape to shrink from, say, the
padding box, the value would change like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: inset(2.5em) padding-box;
```

[Figure 20-21](#ch20.xhtml_insets_from_two_basic_shape_boxes){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the two inset shapes we just defined.

</span>Insets from two basic shape boxes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As with margins, padding, borders, and so on, *value replication* is in
force: if there are fewer than four lengths or percentages, the missing
values are derived from the given values. They go in TRBL order, and
thus the following pairs are internally equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: inset(23%);
shape-outside: inset(23% 23% 23% 23%);  /* same as previous */

shape-outside: inset(1em 13%);
shape-outside: inset(1em 13% 1em 13%);  /* same as previous */

shape-outside: inset(10px 0.5em 15px);
shape-outside: inset(10px 0.5em 15px 0.5em);  /* same as previous */
```

An interesting []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006061136 primary="corners"
secondary="rounding"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797006033632
primary="rounding corners" data-type="indexterm"}aspect of inset shapes
is the ability to round the corners of the shape after the inset has
been calculated. The syntax (and effects) are identical to the
`border-radius` property. Thus, if you wanted to round the corners of
the float shape with a 5-pixel round, you'd write something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: inset(7%) round 5px;
```

On the other hand, if you want each corner to be rounded elliptically,
so that the elliptical curving is 5 pixels tall and half an em wide,
you'd write it like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: inset(7% round 0.5em/5px);
```

Setting a different rounding radius in each corner is also possible and
follows the usual replication pattern, except it starts from the top
left instead of the top. So if you have more than one value, they're in
the order top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left (TL-TR-BR-BL,
or TiLTeR-BuRBLe), and are filled in by copying declared values in for
the missing values.
[Figure 20-22](#ch20.xhtml_rounding_the_corners_fig){data-type="xref"}
shows a few examples. (The rounded shapes in the middle are the float
shapes, which have been added for clarity. Browsers do not actually draw
the float shapes on the page.)

If you're familiar with circular and elliptical gradient images, the
syntax for defining circular and elliptical float shapes will seem very
much the same. There are some important caveats, however, as this
section will explore.
:::

Suppose we want to create a circle shape that's centered in its float,
with a 25-pixel radius. We can accomplish that in any of the following
ways:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: circle(25px);
shape-outside: circle(25px at center);
shape-outside: circle(25px at 50% 50%);
```

Regardless of which we use, the result will be that shown in
[Figure 20-23](#ch20.xhtml_a_circular_float_shape){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_a_circular_float_shape" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1832"><span class="label">Figure 20-23.
</span>A circular float shape</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Something to watch out for is that shapes *cannot* exceed their shape
box, even if you set up a condition where that seems possible. For
example, suppose we applied the previous 25-pixel-radius rule to a small
image, one that's no more than 30 pixels on a side. In that case, you'll
have a circle 50 pixels in diameter centered on a rectangle that's
smaller than the circle. What happens? The circle may be defined to
stick out past the edges of the shape box---in the default case, the
margin box---but it will be clipped at the edges of the shape box. Thus,
given the following rules, the content will flow past the image as if it
had no shape, as shown in
[Figure 20-24](#ch20.xhtml_a_rather_small_circular_float_shape){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {shape-outside: circle(25px at center);}
img#small {height: 30px; width: 35px;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_a_rather_small_circular_float_shape" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1833"><span class="label">Figure 20-24.
</span>A rather small circular float shape for an even smaller
image</h6>
</div>
</figure>

We can see the circle extending past the edges of the image, but notice
how the text flows along the edge of the image, not the float shape.
Again, that's because the actual float shape is clipped by the shape
box; in
[Figure 20-24](#ch20.xhtml_a_rather_small_circular_float_shape){data-type="xref"},
that's the margin box, which is at the outer edge of the image. So the
actual float shape isn't a circle, but a box the exact dimensions of the
image.

The same holds true no matter what edge you define to be the shape box.
If you declare `shape-outside: circle(5em) content-box;`, the shape will
be clipped at the edges of the content box. Content will be able to flow
over the padding, borders, and margins, and will not be pushed away in a
circular fashion.

This means you can do things like create a float shape that's the
lower-right quadrant of a circle in the upper-left corner of the float,
assuming the image is `3em` square:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: circle(3em at top left);
```

For that matter, if you have a perfectly square float, you can define a
circle-quadrant that just touches the opposite sides, using a percentage
radius:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
shape-outside: circle(50% at top left);
```

But note: that works *only* if the float is square. If it's rectangular,
oddities creep in. Take this example, which is illustrated in

</span>The circular float shape that results from a rectangle</h6>

</figure>

Don't bother trying to pick which dimension is controlling the `50%`
calculation, because neither is. Or, in a sense, both are.

When you define a percentage for the radius of a circular float shape,
it's calculated with respect to a calculated *reference box*. The height
and width of this box are calculated as follows:

<figure>
<div class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_2026.png" width="413" height="68"
alt="css5 2026" />
<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1835"></h6>
</div>
</figure>

In effect, this creates a square that's a blending of the float's
intrinsic height and width. In the case of our floated image of 70 × 150
pixels, that works out to a square that's 117.047 pixels on a side.
Thus, the circle's radius is 50% of that, or 58.5235 pixels.

Once again, note that the content in
[Figure 20-26](#ch20.xhtml_a_clipped_float_shape){data-type="xref"} is
flowing past the image and ignoring the circle. That's because the
actual float shape is clipped by the shape box, so the final float shape
would be a kind of vertical bar with rounded ends, something very much
like what's shown in
[Figure 20-26](#ch20.xhtml_a_clipped_float_shape){data-type="xref"}.

It's a lot simpler to position the center of the circle and have it grow
until it touches either the closest side to the circle's center, or the
farthest side from the circle's center. Both techniques are possible, as
shown here and illustrated in
[Figure 20-27](#ch20.xhtml_various_circular_float_shapes){data-type="xref"}:

###### Note {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1838}

In one of the examples in
[Figure 20-27](#ch20.xhtml_various_circular_float_shapes){data-type="xref"},
the shape is clipped to its shape box, whereas in the others, the shape
is allowed to extend beyond it. If we hadn't clipped the shape, it would
have been too big for the figure! You'll see this again in the next
figure.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005622496 primary=""
startref="ix_circ_float_shape" data-type="indexterm"}
:::

Now, how about []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_ellip_float_shape
primary="elliptical float shapes" data-type="indexterm"}ellipses?
Besides using the name `ellipse()`, the only syntactical difference
between circles and ellipses is that you define two radii instead of one
radius. The first is the x (horizontal) radius, and the second is the y
(vertical) radius. Thus, for an ellipse with an x radius of 20 pixels
and a y radius of 30 pixels, you'd declare `ellipse(20px 30px)`.

You can use any length or percentage, *or* the keywords `closest-side`
and `farthest-side`, for either of the radii in an ellipse.
[Figure 20-28](#ch20.xhtml_various_elliptical_float_shapes){data-type="xref"}
shows some possibilities.

<figure>

</span>Defining float shapes with ellipses</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Working with percentages for the lengths of the radii is a little
different with ellipses than with circles. Instead of a calculated
reference box, percentages in ellipses are calculated against the axis
of the radius. Thus, horizontal percentages are calculated with respect
to the width of the shape box, and vertical percentages with respect to
the height. This is illustrated in
[Figure 20-29](#ch20.xhtml_elliptical_float_shapes_and_percentages){data-type="xref"}.

As with any basic shape, an elliptical shape is clipped at the edges of
the shape box.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005611216 primary=""

:::: {#ch20.xhtml_polygons .sect3}
### Polygons {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1841}

Polygons are a lot []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_poly_float_shape
primary="polygon float shapes" data-type="indexterm"}more complicated to
write, though they may be a little bit easier to understand. You define
a polygonal shape by specifying a comma-separated list of *x*-*y*
coordinates, expressed as either lengths or percentages, calculated from
the top left of the shape box, as in SVG. Each *x*-*y* pair is a
*vertex* in the polygon. If the first and last vertices are not the
same, the browser will close the polygon by connecting them. (All
polygonal float shapes must be closed.)

So let's say we want a diamond shape that's 50 pixels tall and wide. If
we start building the polygon from the topmost vertex, the `polygon()`
value would look like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
polygon(25px 0, 50px 25px, 25px 50px, 0 25px)
```

Percentages have the same behavior as they do in `background-image`
positioning (for example), so we can define a diamond shape that always
"fills out" the shape box. It would be written like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
polygon(50% 0, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0 50%)
```

The result of this and the previous polygon example are shown in
[Figure 20-30](#ch20.xhtml_a_polygonal_float_shape){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_a_polygonal_float_shape" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_2031.png" width="600" height="119"

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1842"><span class="label">Figure 20-30.
</span>A polygonal float shape</h6>
</div>
</figure>

These examples both start from the topmost vertex, but they don't have
to. All of the following will yield the same result:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
polygon(50% 0, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0 50%) /* clockwise from top */
polygon(0 50%, 50% 0, 100% 50%, 50% 100%) /* clockwise from left */
polygon(50% 100%, 0 50%, 50% 0, 100% 50%) /* clockwise from bottom */
polygon(0 50%, 50% 100%, 100% 50%, 50% 0) /* counterclockwise from left */
```

As before, remember: if a shape definition exceeds the shape box, it
will always be clipped to it. So even if you create a polygon with
coordinates that lie outside the shape box (by default, the margin box),
the polygon will get clipped.
[Figure 20-31](#ch20.xhtml_how_a_float_shape_is_clipped){data-type="xref"}
demonstrates [the result.]{.keep-together}

<figure>

</span>How a float shape is clipped when it exceeds the shape box</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Polygons have an extra wrinkle: you can toggle their fill rule. By
default, the fill rule is `nonzero`, but the other possible value is
`evenodd`. It's easier to show the difference than to describe it, so
here's a star polygon with two fill rules, illustrated in
[Figure 20-32](#ch20.xhtml_the_two_polygonal_fills){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
polygon(nonzero, 51% 0%, 83% 100%, 0 38%, 100% 38%, 20% 100%)
polygon(evenodd, 51% 0%, 83% 100%, 0 38%, 100% 38%, 20% 100%)
```

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_the_two_polygonal_fills" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_2033.png" width="600" height="127"
alt="image" />
<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1844"><span class="label">Figure 20-32.
</span>The two polygonal fills</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The default `nonzero` case is what we tend to think of with filled
polygons: a single shape, completely filled. The `evenodd` option has a
different effect, in which some pieces of the polygon are filled and
others are not.

This particular example doesn't show much difference, since the part of
the polygon that's missing is completely enclosed by filled parts, so
the end result is the same either way. However, imagine a shape that has
sideways spikes, and then a line that cuts vertically across the middle
of them. Rather than a comb shape, you'd end up with a set of
discontinuous triangles. There are a lot of possibilities.

As you can imagine, a polygon can become very complex, with a large
number of vertices. You're welcome to work out the coordinates of each
vertex on paper and type them in, but it makes a lot more sense to use a
tool to do this. A good example of such a tool is the CSS Shapes Editor
extension available for Chrome via the Chrome Web Store. (Firefox has
this capability built natively into its web inspector.) You can select a
float in the DOM inspector, bring up the CSS Shapes Editor, select a
polygon, and then start creating and moving vertices in the browser,
with live reflowing of the content as you do so. Then, once you're
satisfied, you can drag-select-copy the polygon value for pasting into
your stylesheet.

Much like a regular element margin, a *shape margin* pushes content away
by either a length or a percentage; a percentage is calculated with
respect to the width of the element's containing block, just as are
regular margins.

The advantage of a shape margin is that you can define a shape that
exactly matches the thing you want to shape, and then use the shape
margin to create extra space. Take an image-based shape, where part of
the image is visible and the rest is transparent. Instead of having to
add opaque portions to the image to keep text and other content away
from the visible part of the image, you can just add a shape margin.
[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005314368 primary="distance values"
data-type="indexterm"}This enlarges the shape by the distance supplied.

In detail, the new shape is found by drawing a line perpendicular from
each point along the basic shape, with a length equal to the value of
`shape-margin`, to find a point in the new shape. At sharp corners, a
circle is drawn centered on that point with a radius equal to the value
of `shape-margin`. After all that, the new shape is the smallest shape
that can describe all those points and circles (if any).

Remember, though, that a shape can never exceed the shape box. Thus, by
default, the shape can't get any bigger than the margin box of the
unshaped float. Since `shape-margin` actually increases the size of the
shape, any part of the newly enlarged shape that exceeds the shape box
will be clipped.

To see what this means, consider the following, as illustrated in
[Figure 20-34](#ch20.xhtml_adding_margins_to_float_shapes){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {float: left; margin: 0; shape-outside: url(star.svg);
    border: 1px solid hsl(0 100% 50% / 0.25);}
#one {shape-margin: 0;}
#two {shape-margin: 1.5em;}
#thr (shape-margin: 10%;}
```

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_adding_margins_to_float_shapes" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_2035.png" width="600" height="143"

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1849"><span class="label">Figure 20-34.
</span>Adding margins to float shapes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice the way the content flows past the second and third examples.
There are definitely places where the content gets closer than the
specified `shape-margin`, because the shape has been clipped at the
margin box of the floated element. To make sure the separation distance
is always observed, include standard margins that equal or exceed the
`shape-margin` distance. For example, we could have avoided the problem
by modifying two of the rules like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#two {shape-margin: 1.5em; margin: 0 1.5em 1.5em 0;}
#thr (shape-margin: 10%; margin: 0 10% 10% 0;}
```

In both cases, the right and bottom margins are set to be the same as
the `shape-margin` value, ensuring that the enlarged shape will never
exceed the shape box on those sides. This is demonstrated in
[Figure 20-35](#ch20.xhtml_making_sure_the_shape_margins){data-type="xref"}.

</span>Making sure the shape margins don’t get clipped</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If you have a float go to the right, you'll have to adjust its margins
to create space below and to the left, not the right, but the principle
is the same. You can also use `float: inline-end` and the
`margin-inline` property to ensure that if the writing direction
changes, your layout still works as
intended.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005190992 primary=""

Similar to float shaping, CSS also offers clipping and masking of
elements, albeit without any shaping of the element box. These are
methods of showing only portions of an element, using a variety of
simple shapes as well as the application of complete images and SVG
elements. These can be used to make decorative bits of a layout more
visually interesting, among other things---a common technique is to
frame images or give them ragged edges.

With `clip-path`, you're able to define a *clipping shape*. This is
essentially the area of the element inside which visible portions are
drawn. Any part of the element that falls outside the shape is clipped
away, leaving behind empty transparent space. The following code gives
an unclipped and a clipped example of the same paragraph, with the
result depicted in
[Figure 20-36](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-compare){data-type="xref"}:

probably expect. Similarly, if a \<*`url`*\> value is given (as in the
preceding code) and it points to a missing resource, or to an element in
an SVG file that isn't a `<clipPath>`, no clipping is
[performed.]{.keep-together}

## Clip Shapes {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1856}

You can define []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005094080 primary="clipping"
secondary="based on simple shapes"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005093072
primary="clipping shape" data-type="indexterm"}clip shapes with one of a
set of four simple shape functions. These are identical to the shape
functions used to define float shapes with `shape-outside`, so we won't
redescribe them in detail here. Here's a brief recap:

`inset()`

:   Accepts[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005090032
    primary="inset() function, clip shapes" data-type="indexterm"} from
    one to four lengths or percentage values, defining offsets from the
    edges of the bounding box, with optional corner rounding via the
    `round` keyword and another set of one to four lengths or
    percentages.

`circle()`

:   Accepts[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005087216
    primary="circle() function, clip shapes" data-type="indexterm"} a
    single length, percentage, or keyword defining the radius of the
    circle, with an optional position for the circle's center with the
    `at` keyword followed by one or two lengths or percentages.

`ellipse()`

:   Accepts[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005084400
    primary="ellipse() function, clip shapes" data-type="indexterm"} a
    mandatory two lengths, percentages, or keywords defining the radii
    of the vertical and horizontal axes of the ellipse, with an optional
    position for the ellipse's center with the `at` keyword followed by
    one or two lengths or percentages.

`polygon()`

:   Accepts[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797005057152
    primary="polygon() function, clip shapes" data-type="indexterm"} a
    comma-separated list of space-separated *x* and *y* coordinates,
    using either lengths or percentages. Can be prefaced by a keyword
    defining the fill rule for the polygon.

[Figure 20-37](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-shapes){data-type="xref"} shows a
variety of examples of these clip shapes, corresponding to the following
styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.ex01 {clip-path: none;}
.ex02 {clip-path: inset(10px 0 25% 2em);}
.ex03 {clip-path: circle(100px at 50% 50%);}
.ex04 {clip-path: ellipse(100px 50px at 75% 25%);}
.ex05 {clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0 50%);}
.ex06 {clip-path: polygon(0 0, 50px 100px, 150px 5px, 200px 200px, 0 100%);}

As [Figure 20-37](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-shapes){data-type="xref"} shows,
the elements are visible only inside the clip shapes. Anything outside
that is just gone. But note that the clipped elements still take up the
same space they would if they weren't clipped at all. In other words,
clipping doesn't make the elements smaller. It just limits the part of
them that's actually drawn.

## Clip Boxes {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1858}

Unlike []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_clip_box primary="clipping"
secondary="based on boxes"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_ix_box_clip primary="boxes"
secondary="clipping based on" data-type="indexterm"}clip shapes, clip
boxes aren't specified using lengths or percentages. They correspond,
for the most part, directly to boundaries in the box model.

If you just write `clip-path: border-box`, for example, the element is
clipped along the outside edge of the border. This is likely what you'd
expect anyway, since margins are transparent. Remember, however, that
outlines can be drawn outside borders, so if you *do* clip at the border
edge, any outlines will be clipped away. That includes any outlines,
which can create a major accessibility problem, so be very careful
clipping any element that can receive focus. (You probably just
shouldn't do it in those cases.)

When used by themselves, the values `margin-box`, `padding-box`, and
`content-box` dictate that the clipping occurs at the outer edges of the
margin, padding, or content areas, respectively. These are diagrammed in
[Figure 20-38](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-boxes){data-type="xref"}.

There's another part to
[Figure 20-38](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-boxes){data-type="xref"}, which
[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004915680 primary="SVG format"
secondary="object bounding box"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004914704
primary="bounding box" data-type="indexterm"}shows the SVG bounding
boxes:

`view-box`

:   The []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004912080 primary="view-box, SVG"
    data-type="indexterm"}nearest (the closest ancestor) SVG viewport is
    used as the clipping box.

`fill-box`

:   The *object bounding box* is []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004909360
    primary="fill-box, SVG" data-type="indexterm"}used as the clipping
    box. The object bounding box is the smallest box that will fit every
    part of the element's geometry, taking into account any
    transformations (e.g., rotation), not including any strokes along
    its outside.

`stroke-box`

:   The *stroke bounding box* is []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004906640
    primary="stroke-box, SVG" data-type="indexterm"}used as the clipping
    box. Similar to the fill box, the stroke box is the smallest box
    that will fit every part of the element's geometry, taking into
    account any transformations (e.g., rotation), but the stroke box
    includes any strokes along its outside.

These values apply only to SVG elements that don't have an associated
CSS layout box. For such elements, if the CSS-style boxes (`margin-box`,
`border-box`, `padding-box`, `content-box`) are given, `fill-box` is
used instead. Conversely, if one of the SVG bounding box values is
applied to an element that *does* have a CSS layout box---which is most
elements---`border-box` is used instead.

It can be useful at times to be able to use something like
`clip-path: content-box` just to clip away everything outside the
content area, but these box values really come into their own in
conjunction with a clipping shape. Suppose you have an `ellipse()` clip
shape you want to apply to an element, and furthermore, you want to have
it just touch the outer edges of the padding box. Rather than have to
calculate the necessary radii by subtracting margins and borders from
the overall element, you can just write
`clip-path: ellipse(50% 50%) padding-box`. That will center an
elliptical clip shape at the center of the element, with horizontal and
vertical radii half the element's reference box, as shown in
[Figure 20-39](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-boxes-ellipse){data-type="xref"},
along with the effect of fitting to other boxes.

Notice that the ellipse is cut off in the `margin-box` example? That's
because the margin is invisible, so while parts of it fall inside the
elliptical clip shape, we can't actually see those parts unless there's
a box shadow or an outset border image on the element.

Interestingly, the bounding-box keywords can be used only in conjunction
with clip shapes---*not* with an SVG-based clip path. The keywords that
relate to SVG bounding boxes apply only if an SVG image is being clipped
via CSS.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004895712 primary=""

## Clipping with SVG Paths {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1861}

If you []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004891712 primary="clipping"

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004890704

primary="clipping" secondary="with SVG paths"
secondary-sortas="SVG paths" data-type="indexterm"}happen to have an SVG
path handy, or you're comfortable writing your own, you can use it to
define the clipping shape in the `clip-path` property. The syntax looks
like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
clip-path: path("…");
```

Replace that ellipsis with the contents of an SVG `d` or `points`
attribute, and that will give you a clipping shape. Here's an example of
such an attribute:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<path d="M 500,0 L 1000,250 L 500,500 L 0,250"/>
```

This will draw a diamond from the point at *x*=500, *y*=0 to *x*=1000,
*y*=250, and so on, forming a diamond shape 1,000 pixels across by 500
high. If applied to an image exactly 1,000 pixels by 500 pixels, you'd
get the result shown in
[Figure 20-40](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-svg-path){data-type="xref"}.

<figure class="width-50">
<div id="ch20.xhtml_clipping-svg-path" class="figure">

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1862"><span class="label">Figure 20-40.
</span>An image clipped with an SVG clip path</h6>
</div>
</figure>

You'd get the same clip shape shown in
[Figure 20-40](#ch20.xhtml_clipping-svg-path){data-type="xref"} by using
the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 50%, 50% 100%, 0% 50%);
```

The difference here is that the clipping path defined with percentage
values in a polygon is a lot more robust than one that requires images
to be exactly 1,000 pixels wide by 500 pixels tall. That's because, as
of late 2022, all SVG path coordinates are expressed in absolute units,
and can't be declared as percentages of the image's height and width as
the [`polygon()`]{.keep-together} shape can.

# Masks {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1864}

When we []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_masks_ch20 primary="masks"
data-type="indexterm"}say *mask*, at least in this context, we mean a
shape inside of which things are visible, and outside of which they are
not. Masks are thus very similar in concept to clipping paths. The
primary differences are twofold: first, with masks you can only use an
image to define the areas of the element that are shown or clipped away;
and second, a lot more properties are available to use with masks,
allowing you to do things such as position, size, and repeat the masking
image.

Assuming the image reference is valid, `mask-image` will give the
browser an image to use as a mask for the element to which it's being
applied.

We'll start with a simple situation: one image applied to another, where
both are the same height and width.
[Figure 20-41](#ch20.xhtml_masks-image-simple){data-type="xref"} shows
two images separately, along with the first image being masked by the
second.

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_masks-image-simple" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_2042.png" width="600" height="159"

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1868"><span class="label">Figure 20-41.
</span>A simple image mask</h6>
</div>
</figure>

As the figure shows, in the parts of the second image that are opaque,
the first image is visible. In the parts that are transparent, the first
image is not visible. For the parts that are semitransparent, the first
image is also semitransparent.

Here's the basic code for the end result shown in
[Figure 20-41](#ch20.xhtml_masks-image-simple){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.masked {mask-image: url(theatre-masks.svg);}
```

CSS doesn't require that you apply mask images only to other images,
though. You can mask pretty much any element with an image, and that
image can be a raster image (GIF, JPG, PNG) or a vector image (SVG). The
latter is usually a better choice, if available. You can even construct
your own image with gradients, whether linear or radial, repeated or
otherwise.

The following styles will have the result shown in
[Figure 20-42](#ch20.xhtml_masks-image-variety){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*.masked.theatre {mask-image: url(i/theatre-masks.svg);}
*.masked.compass {mask-image: url(i/Compass_masked.png);}
*.masked.lg-fade {mask-image:
	repeating-linear-gradient(135deg, #000 0 1em, transparent 3em 4em);
}
```

</span>A variety of image masks</h6>
</div>
</figure>

An important point to keep in mind is that when a mask clips away pieces
of an element, it clips away *all* pieces. The best example of this
occurs when you apply an image that clips away the outer edges of
elements, and the markers on list items can very easily become
invisible.
[Figure 20-43](#ch20.xhtml_masks-image-listitems){data-type="xref"}
shows an example, which is the result of the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
*.masked {mask-image: url(i/Compass_masked.png);}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<ol class="masked">
    <li>One</li>
    <li>Two</li>
    <li>Three</li>
    <li>Four</li>
    <li>Five</li>
</ol>
```

</span>A PNG with areas of transparency masking an unordered list</h6>
</div>
</figure>

One other value option enables you to point directly at a `<mask>`
element in SVG to use the mask it defines. This is analogous to pointing
to a `<clipPath>` or other SVG element from the property `clip-path`.
Here's an example of how a mask might be defined:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<svg>
	<mask id="hexlike">
	   <path fill="#FFFFFF"
             d="M 50,0 L 100,25 L 100,75 L 50,100 L 0,75 L 0,25" />
	</mask>
</svg>
```

With that SVG embedded in the HTML file directly, the mask can be
referenced like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.masked {mask-image: url(#hexlike);}
```

If the SVG is in an external file, this is how to reference it from CSS:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
.masked {mask-image: url(masks.svg#hexlike);}
```

The difference between using an image as a mask versus an SVG `<mask>`
is that SVG masking is based on luminance, rather than alpha
transparency. This difference can be inverted with the `mask-mode`
property.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004520256 primary=""

use an image as a mask. Masking is accomplished by applying an image
with an alpha channel to another element. Masking can also be done by
using the brightness of each part of the masking image to define the
mask. Switching between these two options is accomplished with the
`mask-mode` property.

Two of the three values are straightforward: `alpha` means the alpha
channel of the image should be used to compute the mask, and `luminance`
means the brightness levels should be used. The difference is
illustrated in [Figure 20-44](#ch20.xhtml_masks-mode){data-type="xref"},
which is the result of the following code:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img.theatre {mask-image: url(i/theatre-masks.svg);}
img.compass {mask-image: url(i/Compass_masked.png);}
img.lum {mask-mode: luminance;}
```

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<img src="i/theatre-masks.svg" role="img" alt="theater mask">
<img class="theatre" src="i/mask.jpg" alt="mask">
<img class="theatre lum" src="i/mask.jpg" alt="mask">
<img src="i/Compass_masked.png" alt="mask">
<img class="compass" src="i/mask.jpg" alt="mask">
<img class="compass lum" src="i/mask.jpg" alt="mask">
```

When `luminance` is used to calculate the mask, brightness is treated
the same way alpha values are in alpha masking. Consider how alpha
masking works: any part of the image with opacity of 0 hides that part
of the masked element. A part of the image with opacity of 1 (fully
opaque) reveals that part of the masked element.

The same is true with luminance-based masking. A part of the mask with
luminosity of 1 reveals that part of the masked element. A part of the
mask with luminosity of 0 (fully black) hides that part of the masked
element. But note that any fully transparent part of the mask is *also*
treated as having a luminance of 0. This is why the shadow portion of
the theater-mask image doesn't show any part of the masked image: its
alpha value is greater than 0.

The third (and default) value, `match-source`, is a combination of
`alpha` and `luminance`, choosing between them based on the actual
source image for the mask as follows:

-   If the source is a type of \<*`image`*\>, use `alpha`. The
    \<*`image`*\> can be an image such as a PNG or visible SVG, a CSS
    gradient, or a piece of the page referred to by the
    [`element()`]{.keep-together} function.

-   If the source is an SVG `<mask>` element, use
    `luminance`.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797004327152 primary=""

In many cases, mask images may be a different size than the masked
element. CSS has a couple of ways to deal with this, starting with
`mask-size`.

If you've ever sized background images, you know exactly how to size
masks, because the value syntax is *exactly* the same, as are the
behaviors. As an example, consider the following styles, which have the
result shown in

All this does is clip the overall mask to a specific area of the masked

parts of the element are in fact visible.

If you are not familiar with compositing operations, a diagram is in
order. See
[Figure 20-50](#ch20.xhtml_masks-composite-diagram){data-type="xref"}.

<figure>
<div id="ch20.xhtml_masks-composite-diagram" class="figure">
<img src="./images/css5_2051.png" width="600" height="307"

<h6 id="ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1889"><span class="label">Figure 20-50.
</span>Compositing operations</h6>
</div>
</figure>

The image on top in the operation is called the *source*, and the image
beneath it is called the *destination*.

This doesn't particularly matter for three of the four operations:
`add`, `intersect`, and `exclude`, all of which have the same result
regardless of which image is the source and which the destination. But
for `subtract`, the question is: which image is being subtracted from
which? The answer: the destination is subtracted from the source.

The distinction between source and destination also becomes important
when compositing multiple masks together. In these cases, the
compositing order is from back to front, with each succeeding layer
being the source and the already-composited layers beneath it being the
destination.

To see why, consider
[Figure 20-51](#ch20.xhtml_masks-composite-multiple){data-type="xref"},
which shows the various ways three overlapping masks are composited
together, and how results change with changes to their order and
compositing operations.

The figure is constructed to show the bottommost mask at the bottom, the
topmost above the other two, and the resulting mask at the very top.
Thus, in the first column, the triangle and circle are composited with
an exclusion operation. The resulting shape is then composited with the
square using an additive operation. That results in the mask shown at
the top of the first column.

Just remember that when doing a subtraction composite, the bottom shape
is subtracted from the shape above it. Thus, in the third column, the
addition of the triangle and circle is subtracted from the square above
them.[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797003667520 primary=""

data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797003666544 primary=""

with `mask-composite: add, subtract`.

Like all the other masking properties, `mask` accepts a comma-separated
list of masks. The order of the values in each mask can be anything
except for the mask size, which always follows the position and is
separated from it by a forward slash (`/`).

Thus, the following rules are equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
#example {
    mask-image: url(circle.svg), url(square.png), url(triangle.gif);
    mask-repeat: repeat-y, no-repeat;
    mask-position: top right, center, 25% 67%;
    mask-composite: subtract, add;
    mask-size: auto, 50% 33%, contain;
}
#example {
    mask:
      url(circle.svg) repeat-y top right / auto subtract,
      url(square.png) no-repeat center / 50% 33% add,
      url(triangle.gif) repeat-y 25% 67% / contain;
}
```

The triangle and square are added together, and then the result of that
additive composite is subtracted from the circle. The result is shown in
[Figure 20-52](#ch20.xhtml_masks-multiple){data-type="xref"} as applied
to a square element (the teal shape on the left) and a shape wider than
it is tall (the goldenrod shape on the right).

This property is similar to `mask-mode`, except there is no
`match-source` equivalent. You can choose only `luminance` or `alpha`.

The interesting thing is that if `mask-type` is set for a `<mask>`
element that's used to mask an element, and `mask-mode` is declared for
that masked element, `mask-mode` wins. As an example, consider the
following rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
svg #mask {mask-type: alpha;}
img.masked {mask: url(#mask) no-repeat center/cover luminance;}
```

Given these rules, the masked images will have a mask with luminance
compositing, not alpha compositing. If the `mask-mode` value were left
at its default value, `match-source`, then `mask-type`'s value would be
used instead.

## Border-Image Masking {#ch20.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1896}

The []{#ch20.xhtml_ix_mask_border_image primary="masks"
secondary="border-image masking" data-type="indexterm"}same
specification that defines clipping paths and element masking, CSS
Masking, also defines properties that are used to apply masking images
in a way that mirrors border-image properties. In fact, with one
exception, the properties between border images and border masks are
direct analogues, and the values the same. Refer to ["Image
Borders"](../Text/ch07.xhtml#image-borders){data-type="xref"} for a
detailed explanation of how these work, but here are some quick recaps.

Remember that without having a border of some sort, none of these
properties will have any visible effect. To apply a border and then mask
it, you must first declare a border's style, at a minimum. If you intend
your masked border to be 10 pixels wide, you would need something like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
border: 10px solid;
```

Once that's []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797003460880
primary="mask-border-source property" data-type="indexterm"}been
established, you can begin masking the border.

The `mask-border-slice` property establishes a set of four slice-lines
that are laid over the border, and where they fall determines how the
mask will be sliced up for use in each of the eight parts of the border
area: the top, right, bottom, and left edges, as well as the top-left,
top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left corners. The property takes up
to four values, defining (in order) offsets from the top, right, bottom,
and left edges.

As of late 2022, no logical-property equivalent exists for

something equivalent, to this property is ever adopted and implemented,
at that point it will be possible to use `mask-border-slice` in a

You might think that numeric offsets need to be given a length unit to
define a distance, but this is not so. Number values are interpreted in
the coordinate system of the image used for the mask. With a raster
image like a PNG, the coordinate system will be the pixels of the image.
In an SVG image, the coordinate system defined by the SVG file is used.

Using the optional `fill` keyword causes the center portion of the mask
image to be applied to the element inside the border area. By default,
it is not used, allowing the element's padding and content to be fully
seen. If you do use it by adding `fill`, the part of the mask image
inside the four slice lines will be stretched over the element's content
and padding, and applied to them. Consider the following, illustrated in
[Figure 20-54](#ch20.xhtml_mask-border-fill){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {mask-border-image: url(circles.png);}

This property allows you to define a width (or individual widths) for
the four edge slices of the border mask. If the slices are not actually
the size(s) you declare, they will be resized to fit. For example, a
masking image might be sliced and then sized as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
mask-border-slice: 33%; mask-border-width: 1em;
```

This []{#ch20.xhtml_idm45797003245616

With `mask-border-outset`, you can push the mask outside the border
area. This is useful only if you're already pushing a border image
outside the border area with `border-image-outset` and want to also
apply the mask to that border image, or if you've applied an outline to
the element and want to mask that as well. If neither is true, the
masked area outside the border will mask only the margin area, which is
already transparent and so can't be visibly altered.

Thus far, our only example of border masking has used a masking image
that is an exact fit for the element it's masking. This is unlikely to
be the case, since elements can be resized by any number of factors. The
default is to stretch each slice to fit its part of the border area, but
other options are possible.
[Figure 20-55](#ch20.xhtml_mask-border-repeating){data-type="xref"}
illustrates the options (center areas have been removed for clarity).

If you've ever worked with `background-size`, these values probably look
familiar. They do similar things, too, only with replaced elements.

For example, assume a 50 × 50 pixel image. We can change its size via
CSS with something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {width: 250px; height: 150px;}
```

The default expectation is that these style declarations will stretch
the 50 × 50 image to be 250 × 150. And if `object-fit` is its default
value, `fill`, that's exactly what happens.

Change the value of `object-fit`, however, and other behaviors occur.
The following examples are illustrated in
[Figure 20-56](#ch20.xhtml_object-fit){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {width: 250px; height: 150px; background: silver; border: 3px solid;}

In the first instance, `none`, the `<img>` element is drawn 250 pixels
wide by 150 pixels tall. The image itself, however, is drawn 50 × 50
pixels---its intrinsic size---because it was directed to *not* fit the
element box. The second instance, `fill`, is the default behavior, as
mentioned. This is the only value that may distort the image, as the
dimensions are the element's dimensions, not the image's intrinsic size.

In the third instance, `cover`, the image is scaled up until no part of
the element box is left "uncovered"---but the image itself keeps its
intrinsic aspect ratio. In other words, the image stays a square. In
this case, the longest axis of the `<img>` element is `250px` long, so
the image is scaled up to be 250 × 250 pixels. That 250 × 250 image is
then placed in the 250 × 150 `<img>` element.

The fourth instance, `contain`, is similar, except the image is only big
enough to touch two sides of the `<img>` element. This means the image
is 150 × 150 pixels, and placed into the 250 × 150 pixel box of its
`<img>` element.

To reiterate, what you see in
[Figure 20-56](#ch20.xhtml_object-fit){data-type="xref"} is four `<img>`
elements. There are no wrapper `<div>` or `<span>` or other elements
around those images. The border and background color are part of the
`<img>` element. The image placed inside the `<img>` element is fitted
according to `object-fit`. The element box of the `<img>` element then
acts rather like it's a simple mask for the fitted image inside it. (And
then you can mask and clip the element box with the properties covered
earlier in this chapter.)

A fifth value for `object-fit`, not represented in
[Figure 20-56](#ch20.xhtml_object-fit){data-type="xref"}, is
`scale-down`. The meaning of `scale-down` is "do the same as either
`none` or `contain`, whichever leads to a smaller size." This lets an
image always be its intrinsic size unless the `<img>` element gets too
small, in which case it's scaled down à la `contain`. This is
illustrated in
[Figure 20-57](#ch20.xhtml_object-fit-scale-down){data-type="xref"},
where each `<img>` element is labeled with the `height` values it's been
given; the `width` in each case is `100px`.

element is bigger or smaller than the element box into which it's being

```
The value syntax here is just like that for `mask-position` or
`background-position`, allowing you to position a replaced element
within its element box if it isn't set to `object-fit: fill`. Thus,
given the following CSS, we get the result shown in
[Figure 20-58](#ch20.xhtml_object-position){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {width: 200px; height: 100px; background: silver; border: 1px solid;
     object-fit: none;}
img:nth-of-type(2) {object-position: top left;}
img:nth-of-type(3) {object-position: 67% 100%;}
img:nth-of-type(4) {object-position: left 142%;}

</span>A variety of <code>object-position</code> values</h6>
</div>
</figure>

Notice that the first example has a value of `50% 50%`, even though that
isn't present in the CSS code. That illustrates that the default value
of `object-position` is `50% 50%`. The next two examples show how
various `object-position` values move the image around within the
`<img>` element box.

As the last example shows, it's possible to move an unscaled replaced
element like an image so that it's partly clipped by its element box.
This is similar to positioning background images or masks so that they
are clipped at the element boundaries.

It's also possible to position fitted elements that are larger than the
element box, as can happen with `object-fit: cover`, although the
results can be very different than with `object-fit: none`. The
following CSS will have results like those shown in
[Figure 20-59](#ch20.xhtml_object-position-cover){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {width: 200px; height: 100px; background: silver; border: 1px solid;
     object-fit: cover;}
img:nth-of-type(2) {object-position: top left;}
img:nth-of-type(3) {object-position: 67% 100%;}

With all of the effects available to CSS authors, we have an infinite
variety of outcomes and thus an infinite variety of creative
presentation of elements. Whether it's altering elements' appearances
with filters, changing how they're composited with their backdrops,
clipping or masking parts of elements, or altering the way images fill
out their element boxes, there have never been more options at your
fingertips.

# [Chapter 21. ]{.label}CSS At-Rules

For 20 chapters now, we've explored the []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_at-rules_ch21
primary="at-rules" data-type="indexterm"}properties, values, and
selectors that can be combined to create CSS rules. These are what we
might call *normal rules* or *regular rules*, and they're powerful, but
sometimes more is needed. Sometimes there needs to be a way to
encapsulate certain styles in conditional blocks, such that styles can
be applied at certain page widths or only if a given CSS feature is
recognized by the browser processing the stylesheet.

These are almost invariably enclosed in *at-rules*, so called because
they start with an at (`@`) symbol. You've seen some of these in
previous chapters, such as `@font-face` and `@counter-style`, but there
are still more that aren't so tightly bound to specifics of styling.
This chapter explores the three powerful at-rules `@media`,
`@container`, and `@supports`.

# Media Queries {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1919}

Thanks to the []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_media_qs
primary="media queries (@media)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_atrule_media primary="at-rules"
secondary="media queries" data-type="indexterm"}mechanisms defined in
HTML and CSS called *media queries*, you can restrict any set of styles
(including entire stylesheets) to a specific medium, such as screen or
print, and to a specific set of media conditions. These mechanisms allow
you to define a combination of media types and conditions such as
display size or color depth, to pick two examples. We'll cover the basic
form before exploring the more complex forms.

:::::: {.section pdf-bookmark="Basic Media Queries" data-type="sect2"}
::::: {#ch21.xhtml_basic-media-queries .sect2}
## Basic Media Queries {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1920}

For []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_media_q_attr primary="media queries (@media)"
secondary="media attribute"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_style_elem_media
primary="<style> element" primary-sortas="style element"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002719920
primary="<link> tag" primary-sortas="link tag"
data-type="indexterm"}HTML-based stylesheets, you can impose medium
restrictions through the `media` attribute. This works the same for both
the `<link>` and `<style>` elements:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print"
    href="article-print.css">
<style media="print">
    body {font-family: sans-serif;}
</style>
```

The `media` attribute[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_media_attr_ch21
primary="media attribute" data-type="indexterm"} can accept a single
medium value or a comma-separated list of values. Thus, to link in a
stylesheet that should be used in only the `screen` and `print` media,
you would write this:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen, print"
    href="visual.css">
```

In a []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002686000 primary="at-rules"
secondary="@import" secondary-sortas="import"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002652416
primary="@import rule" primary-sortas="import rule"
data-type="indexterm"}stylesheet itself, you can also impose medium
restrictions on `@import` rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(visual.css) screen;
@import url(article-print.css) print;
```

Remember []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002604752 primary="all media type"
data-type="indexterm"}that if you don't add medium information to a
stylesheet, it will be applied in *all* media. Therefore, if you want
one set of styles to apply only onscreen, and another to apply only in
print, you need to add medium information to both stylesheets. For
[example:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen"
    href="article-screen.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print"
    href="article-print.css">
```

If you were to remove the `media` attribute from the first `<link>`
element in this example, the rules found in the stylesheet
*article-screen.css* would be applied in *all* media.

CSS also defines syntax for `@media` blocks. This allows you to define
styles for multiple media within the same stylesheet. Consider this
basic example:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<style>
body {background: white; color: black;}
@media screen {
    body {font-family: sans-serif;}
    h1 {margin-top: 1em;}
}
@media print {
    body {font-family: serif;}
    h1 {margin-top: 2em; border-bottom: 1px solid silver;}
}
</style>
```

Here we see that in all media, the `<body>` element is given a white
background and a black foreground by the first rule. This happens
because its stylesheet, the one defined by the `style` attribute, has no
`media` attribute and thus defaults to `all`. Next, a block of rules is
provided for the `screen` medium alone, followed by another block of
rules that applies only in the `print` medium.

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1921}

The indentation shown in these blocks is solely for purposes of clarity.
You don't have to indent the rules found inside an `@media` block, but
you're welcome to do so if it makes your CSS easier to read.
:::

The `@media` blocks can be any size, containing any number of rules.
When authors have control over a single stylesheet, such as in a shared
hosting environment or a CMS that restricts what users can edit,
`@media` blocks may be the only way to define medium-specific styles.
This is also the case when CSS is used to style a document using an XML
language that does not contain a `media` attribute or its equivalent.

These are the three most widely recognized media types:

`all`

:   Use in all presentational media.

`print`

:   Use []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002453344 primary="print media type"
    data-type="indexterm"}when printing the document for sighted users,
    and also when displaying a print preview of the document.

`screen`

:   Use []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002451056 primary="screen media type"
    seealso="viewport" data-type="indexterm"}when presenting the
    document in a screen medium like a desktop computer monitor or a
    handheld device. All web browsers running on such systems are
    screen-medium user agents.

It's entirely possible that new media types will be added over time, so
remember that this limited list may not always be so limited. It's
fairly easy to imagine `augmented-reality` as a media type, for example,
since text in AR displays would likely need to be of higher contrast in
order to stand out against the background reality.

HTML4 defined a list of media types that CSS originally recognized, but
most have been deprecated and should be avoided. These are `aural`,
`braille`, `embossed`, `handheld`, `projection`, `speech`, `tty`, and
`tv`. If you have old stylesheets that use these media types, they
should almost certainly be converted to one of the three recognized
media types, if [possible.]{.keep-together}

::: {.note data-type="note"}
###### Note {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1922}

As of 2022, a couple of browsers still support `projection`, which
allows a document to be presented as a slideshow. Several mobile-device
browsers also support the `handheld` type, but not in
[consistent]{.keep-together} ways.
:::

It's possible in some circumstances to combine media types into
comma-separated lists, though the rationale for doing so isn't terribly
compelling, given the small number of media types currently available.
For example, styles could be restricted to only screen and print media
in the following ways:[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002440784 primary=""
startref="ix_media_q_attr"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002439808 primary=""
startref="ix_style_elem_media"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002438864 primary=""
startref="ix_media_attr_ch21" data-type="indexterm"}

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen, print"
    href="article.css">
```

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(article.css) print, screen;

@media screen,print {
    /* styles go here */
}
```

::: {#ch21.xhtml_complex-media-queries .sect2}
## Complex Media Queries {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1923}

In the []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_media_q_complex
primary="media queries (@media)" secondary="complex"
data-type="indexterm"}previous section, you saw how multiple media types
could be chained together with a comma. We might call that a *compound
media query*, because it allows us to address multiple media at once.
There is a great deal more to media queries, though: it's possible to
apply styles based not just media types, but also features of those
media, such as display size or color depth.

This is a great deal of power, and it's not enough to rely on commas to
make it all happen. Thus, CSS includes the logical operator `and` to
pair media types with features of those media.

Let's see how this plays out in practice. Here are two essentially
equivalent ways of applying an external stylesheet when rendering the
document on a color printer:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<link href="print-color.css"
    media="print and (color)" rel="stylesheet">
```

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(print-color.css) print and (color);
```

Anywhere a media type can be given, a media query can be constructed.
This means that, following on the examples of the previous section, it
is possible to list more than one query in a comma-separated list:

``` {code-language="html" data-type="programlisting"}
<link href="print-color.css"
   media="print and (color), screen and (color)" rel="stylesheet">
```

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@import url(print-color.css) print and (color), screen and (color);
```

If even one of the media queries evaluates to `true`, the associated
stylesheet is applied. Thus, given the previous `@import`,
*print-color.css* will be applied if rendering to a color printer *or*
to a color screen environment. If printing on a black-and-white printer,
both queries will evaluate to `false` and *print-color.css* will not be
applied to the document. The same holds true in a grayscale screen
environment, any speech media environment, and so forth.

Each media descriptor is composed of a media type and one or more listed
media features, with each media feature descriptor enclosed in
parentheses. If no media type is provided, it is assumed to be `all`,
which makes the following two examples equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media all and (min-resolution: 96dpi) {…}
@media (min-resolution: 96dpi) {…}
```

Generally []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002214848
primary="color descriptor, @media"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002214240 primary="colors"
secondary="@media" secondary-sortas="media"
data-type="indexterm"}speaking, a media feature descriptor is formatted
like a property-value pair in CSS, only enclosed by parentheses. A few
differences exist, most notably that some features can be specified
without an accompanying value. For example, any color-based medium will
be matched using `(color)`, whereas any color medium using a 16-bit
color depth is matched using `(color: 16)`. In effect, the use of a
descriptor without a value is a true/false test for that descriptor:
`(color)` means "is this medium in color?"

Multiple feature descriptors can be linked with the `and` logical
keyword. In fact, there are two logical keywords in media queries:

`and`

:   Links []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002196800 primary="and logical keyword"
    data-type="indexterm"}together two or more media features in such a
    way that all of them must be true for the query to be true. For
    example,
    `(color) and (orientation: landscape) and (min-device-width: 800px)`
    means that all three conditions must be satisfied: if the media
    environment has color, is in landscape orientation, *and* the
    device's display is at least 800 pixels wide, then the stylesheet is
    used.

`not`

:   Negates []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002193600
    primary="not logical keyword" data-type="indexterm"}the entire query
    so that if all of the conditions are true, the stylesheet is not
    applied. For example,
    `not (color) and (orientation: landscape) and (min-device-width: 800px)`
    means that if the three conditions are satisfied, the statement is
    negated. Thus, if the media environment has color, is in landscape
    orientation, and the device's display is at least 800 pixels wide,
    then the stylesheet is *not* used. In all other cases, it will be
    used.

CSS []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002191072 primary="or logical keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}has no `or` logical keyword, as its role is served
by the comma, as shown previously.

Note that the `not` keyword can be used only at the beginning of a media
query. It is not presently legal to write something like
`(color) and not (min-device-width: 800px)`. In such cases, the entire
query block will be ignored.

Let's consider an example of how all this plays out:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media screen and (min-resolution: 72dpi) {
	.cl01 {font-style: italic;}
}
@media screen and (min-resolution: 32767dpi) {
	.cl02 {font-style: italic;}
}
@media not print {
	.cl03 {font-style: italic;}
}
@media not print and (monochrome) {
	.cl04 {font-style: italic;}
}
```

[Figure 21-1](#ch21.xhtml_mediaqueries-logical-operators){data-type="xref"}
shows the result, but bear in mind that, even though you may be reading
this on printed paper, the actual image was generated with a
screen-medium browser (Firefox Nightly, as it happens) displaying an
HTML document with the previous CSS applied to it. So everything you see
in
[Figure 21-1](#ch21.xhtml_mediaqueries-logical-operators){data-type="xref"}
was operating under a `screen` medium.

The first line is italicized because the screen on which the file was
displayed had a resolution equal to or greater than 72 dots per inch.
Its resolution was not, however, `32767dpi` or higher, so the second
media block is skipped and thus the second line stays un-italicized. The
third line is italicized because, being a screen display, it was
`not print`. The last line is italicized because it was either not print
or not monochrome---in this case, not monochrome.

Another keyword, `only`, was designed to create deliberate backward
incompatibility. Yes, really.

`only`

:   Used to []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002073696 primary="only keyword"

    almost never a problem in modern usage, but the capability was
    created and so we document it here.) In browsers that *do*
    understand media types, the `only` keyword is ignored and the
    stylesheet is applied. In browsers that do not understand media
    types, the `only` keyword creates an apparent media type of
    `only all`, which is not valid.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002071296

specific media features, which are explained later in the chapter:

\<*`ratio`*\>

:   Two []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002065792 primary="<ratio> value type"
    primary-sortas="ratio value type" data-type="indexterm"}numbers
    separated by a forward slash (`/`), defined in
    [Chapter 5](../Text/ch05.xhtml#values_and_units){data-type="xref"}.

\<*`resolution`*\>

:   A resolution[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002061168
    primary="<resolution> value type"
    primary-sortas="resolution value type" data-type="indexterm"} value
    is a positive \<*`integer`*\> followed by either of the unit
    identifiers `dpi` or `dpcm`. In CSS terms, a *dot* is any display
    unit, the most familiar of which is the pixel. As usual, whitespace
    is not permitted between the \<*`integer`*\> and the identifier.
    Therefore, a display that has exactly 150 pixels (dots) per inch is
    matched with `150dpi`.

## Keyword Media Features {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1926}

So far you've []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_media_desc_value
primary="media queries (@media)"
secondary="media feature descriptors and values"
data-type="indexterm"}seen several media features in the examples, but
not a complete list of the possible features and their values. Let's fix
that now!

Note that none of the following values can be negative, and that media
features are always enclosed in parentheses:

Media feature: `any-hover`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `hover`

    :   Checks for any []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002048576
        primary="any-hover descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}available input mechanism that can hover
        over elements (i.e., trigger a `:hover` state). The `none` value
        means there are no such mechanisms, or no mechanisms that can do
        so conveniently. Compare with the `hover` media feature, which
        restricts checking to the primary input mechanism.

Media feature: `any-pointer`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `coarse` \| `fine`

    :   Checks for an []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002041920
        primary="any-pointer descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}input mechanism that creates an onscreen
        pointer. The `none` values indicates no such devices, `coarse`
        indicates at least one device with limited accuracy (e.g., a
        finger), and `fine` indicates at least one device with high
        accuracy (e.g., a mouse). Compare with `pointer`, which
        restricts checking to the primary input mechanism.

Media feature: `color-gamut`

:   

    Values: `srgb` \| `p3` \| `rec2020`

    :   Tests the []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002034992
        primary="color-gamut descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}range of colors supported by both the
        browser and the output device. As of late 2022, the majority of
        displays support the `srgb` and `p3` gamuts. The `p3` value
        refers to the Display P3 color space, which is a superset of
        sRGB. The `rec2020` value refers to the gamut specified by the
        ITU-R Recommendation BT.2020 Color Space, which is a superset of
        P3. The `color-gamut` media feature is not supported by Firefox
        as of late 2022.

Media feature: `display-mode`

:   

    Values: `fullscreen` \| `standalone` \| `minimal-ui` \| `browser`

    :   Tests the []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002027376
        primary="display-mode descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}display mode of the top-level browsing
        context and any child browsing contexts. This corresponds to the
        Web Application Manifest specification's
        [`display`]{.keep-together} member, and is commonly used to
        check if a progressive web application visitor is browsing a
        website or on an installed application, but applies whether or
        not a manifest has been defined. See ["Forced Colors, Contrast,
        and Display
        Mode"](#ch21.xhtml_forced_colors_contrast_and_display_mode){data-type="xref"}
        for details.

Media feature: `dynamic-range`

:   

    Values: `standard` \| `high`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002020736
        primary="dynamic-range descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether the browsing context supports a
        high dynamic range for visual output. The `high` value means the
        media environment supports high peak brightness, a high contrast
        ratio, and a 24-bit color depth or higher. There are no
        precisely defined values for high peak brightness or color
        contrast, so this is left to browsers to decide. Any device that
        matches `high` will also match `standard`. The `dynamic-range`
        media feature achieved widespread browser support in early 2022.

Media feature: `forced-colors`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `active`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002014432
        primary="forced-colors descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether the browser is in *forced-color*
        mode, which forces browser-default values for a set of CSS
        properties such as `color` and `background-color`, and specific
        values for a handful of others, and may also trigger a
        `prefers-color-scheme` value. See ["Forced Colors, Contrast, and
        Display
        Mode"](#ch21.xhtml_forced_colors_contrast_and_display_mode){data-type="xref"}
        for details. The `forced-colors` media feature is not supported
        by WebKit as of late 2022.

Media feature: `grid`

:   

    Values: `0` \| `1`

    :   Refers []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002007008
        primary="grid descriptor, @media" data-type="indexterm"}to the
        presence (or absence) of a grid-based output device, such as a
        TTY terminal. This does *not* refer to CSS Grid. A grid-based
        device will return `1`; otherwise, `0` is returned. This media
        feature can be used in place of the old `tty` media descriptor.

Media feature: `hover`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `hover`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797002000480
        primary="hover descriptor, @media" data-type="indexterm"}whether
        the user's *primary* input mechanism can hover over elements.
        The `none` value means the primary mechanism cannot hover, or
        cannot do so conveniently; an example of the latter is a mobile
        device that pretends to hover when an inconvenient tap-and-hold
        action is performed. The `hover` value means hovering is
        convenient, such as with a mouse. Compare to `any-hover`, which
        checks whether any mechanism permits hovering, not just the
        primary.

Media feature: `inverted-colors`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `inverted`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001994192 primary=""
        startref="inverted-colors descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether colors are being inverted by the
        underlying operating system. The `none` value means colors are
        being displayed normally; `inverted` means that all pixels in
        the display area are being inverted. The `inverted-colors` media
        feature is supported only in WebKit as of late 2022.

Media feature: `orientation`

:   

    Values: `portrait` \| `landscape`

    :   Refers[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001987552
        primary="orientation descriptor, @media" data-type="indexterm"}
        to the orientation of the user agent's display area, where
        `portrait` is returned if the media feature `height` is equal to
        or greater than the media feature `width`. Otherwise, the result
        is `landscape`.

Media feature: `overflow-block`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `scroll` \| `optional-paged` \| `paged`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001980240
        primary="overflow-block descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}how the output device handles content that
        overflows along the block axis. The `none` value means the
        overflowed content cannot be accessed; `scroll` means the
        content can be accessed by scrolling to it in some way;
        `optional-paged` means the user can scroll to the content, but
        page breaks can be manually triggered using properties like
        `break-inside`; `paged` means overflowing content can be
        accessed only by "paging" to see the content, as in an ebook.
        The `overflow-block` media feature is supported only in Firefox
        as of late 2022.

Media feature: `overflow-inline`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `scroll`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001972704
        primary="overflow-inline descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}to see how the output device handles
        content that overflows along the inline axis. The `none` value
        means the overflowed content cannot be accessed; `scroll` means
        the content can be accessed by scrolling to it in some way. The
        `overflow-inline` media feature is supported only in Firefox as
        of late 2022.

Media feature: `pointer`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `coarse` \| `fine`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001965856
        primary="pointer descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether the *primary* input mechanism
        creates an onscreen pointer. The `none` value means the primary
        input device generates no pointer, `coarse` means it does but
        with limited accuracy, and `fine` means it does with high
        accuracy (e.g., a mouse). Compare to `any-pointer`, which checks
        whether any mechanism creates a pointer, not just the primary.

Media feature: `prefers-color-scheme`

:   

    Values: `light` \| `dark`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001959104
        primary="prefers-color-scheme descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}which color scheme the user has selected
        at the browser or operating system level (i.e., Light mode or
        Dark mode). Thus, the author can define specific color values
        for, say, `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Safari adds a
        `no-preference` value, but this has not been standardized or
        adopted by other browsers as of late 2022.

Media feature: `prefers-contrast`

:   

    Values: `no-preference` \| `less` \| `more` \| `custom`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001952496
        primary="prefers-contrast descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether the user has set a preference for
        high-contrast output, at either the browser or operating system
        level (e.g., Windows High Contrast mode). See ["Forced Colors,
        Contrast, and Display
        Mode"](#ch21.xhtml_forced_colors_contrast_and_display_mode){data-type="xref"}
        for details.

Media feature: `prefers-reduced-motion`

:   

    Values: `no-preference` \| `reduce`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001947088
        primary="prefers-reduced-motion descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether the user has set a preference
        regarding motion, at either the browser or operating system
        level. The `reduce` value means the user has indicated they wish
        motion to be reduced or eliminated, possibly because of
        vestibular disorders that create discomfort when viewing motion
        onscreen. Transitions and animations should most often be put
        into a `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` block for accessibility
        reasons.

Media feature: `scan`

:   

    Values: `progressive` \| `interlace`

    :   Refers []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001941616
        primary="scan descriptor, @media" data-type="indexterm"}to the
        scanning process used in an output device. The `interlace` value
        is the type generally used in CRT and some plasma displays. As
        of late 2022, all known implementations match the `progressive`
        value, making this media feature somewhat useless.

Media feature: `scripting`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `initial-only` \| `enabled`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001935760
        primary="scripting descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether a scripting language such as
        JavaScript is available. The `initial-only` value means
        scripting can be performed only at page load, but not
        thereafter. The `scripting` media feature is not supported by
        any browser as of late 2022.

Media feature: `update`

:   

    Values: `none` \| `slow` \| `fast`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001929344
        primary="update descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether the content's appearance can be
        changed after page load. The `none` value means no updates are
        possible, such as in print media. The `slow` value means changes
        are possible but cannot be animated smoothly because of device
        or browser constraints. The `fast` value means smooth animations
        are possible. The `update` media feature is supported only by
        Firefox as of late 2022.

Media feature: `video-dynamic-range`

:   

    Values: `standard` \| `high`

    :   Checks []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001922544
        primary="video-dynamic-range descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}whether the browsing context supports a
        high dynamic range for visual output on videos. This is useful
        because some devices render video separately from other
        graphics, and so may support a different dynamic range for video
        than for other content. The `high` value means the media
        environment supports high peak brightness, a high contrast
        ratio, and a 24-bit color depth or higher. There are no
        precisely defined values for high peak brightness or color
        contrast, so this is left to browsers to decide. Any device that
        matches `high` will also match `standard`. The
        `video-dynamic-range` media feature achieved widespread browser
        support in early 2022.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001920016

::: {#ch21.xhtml_forced_colors_contrast_and_display_mode .sect2}
## Forced Colors, Contrast, and Display Mode {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1927}

Three of the []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_media_q_user_pref
primary="media queries (@media)"
secondary="user preference and media features"
data-type="indexterm"}previously defined media features relate to user
preference in their display, and allow you to detect those preferences
so you may style accordingly. Two are closely intertwined, so we'll
start with them.

If a user has gone to the effort of defining a specific set of colors to
be used in the display of their content, such as with Windows High
Contrast mode, then `forced-colors: active` will be matched, as will
`prefers-contrast: custom`. You can use one or both of these queries to
apply specific styles under such conditions.

If `forced-colors: active` returns true, the following CSS properties
will be forced to use the browser (or operating system) default values,
overriding any values you may have declared:

-   `background-color`

-   `border-color`

-   `color`

-   `column-rule-color`

-   `outline-color`

-   `text-decoration-color`

-   `text-emphasis-color`

-   `-webkit-tap-highlight-color`

Also, the SVG `fill` and `stroke` attributes will be ignored and set to
their default values.

Additionally, the following property-value combinations are enforced
over whatever the author has declared:

-   `box-shadow: none`

-   `text-shadow: none`

-   `background-image: none` for values that are not URL-based (e.g.,
    gradients)

-   `color-scheme: light dark`

-   `scrollbar-color: auto`

This means that, to pick one example, any element whose hover or focus
styles depend on changing the color of a border will fail to have an
effect. Thus, you could provide a change of font weight and border style
(not color) instead:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
nav a[href] {border: 3px solid gray;}
nav a[href]:is(:hover, :focus) {border-color: red;}

@media (forced-colors: active) {
	:hover {font-weight: bold; border-style: dashed;}
}
```

This is an example of the sorts of changes you should make to
accommodate forced-color situations, providing greater usability through
small changes. You *should not* use this query to set up an entire
separate design for users who have forced certain colors.

As noted previously, if a user has set things up such that
`forced-colors: active` is triggered, `prefers-contrast: custom` will
also be triggered. The meanings of this media feature's values are as
follows:

`no-preference`

:   The browser and/or operating system are not aware of a user
    preference with regards to color contrast.

`less`

:   The user has requested interfaces with less contrast than usual.
    Examples of this could be users with a propensity for migraine
    headaches or dyslexia, as some (not all) dyslexics find
    high-contrast text difficult to parse.

`more`

:   The user has requested interfaces with more contrast than usual.

`custom`

:   The user has defined a specific set of colors that are not matched
    by either `more` or `less`, such as the Windows High Contrast mode.

It is possible to query for any value by not supplying a value, which is
especially useful in this scenario. You might cater to both low- and
high-contrast users as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {background: url(/assets/img/mosaic.png) repeat;}

@media (prefers-contrast) {
	body {background-image: none;}
}
```

The `display-mode` media feature is entirely different from the previous
two features. The `display-mode` media feature lets authors determine
the kind of display environment being used and act accordingly.

First let's define what the various values mean:

`fullscreen`

:   The application takes up the entire available display area and does
    not show any application chrome (e.g., address bar, back button,
    status bar, etc.).

`standalone`

:   The application appears like a native standalone application. This
    removes application chrome such as address bar, but will make
    operating-system-derived navigation elements like back buttons
    available.

`minimal-ui`

:   The application appears similar to a native standalone application,
    but provides a way to access application chrome for things like
    address bars, the application's navigation controls, and so on.
    System-specific interface controls for things like "share" or
    "print" may also be included.

`browser`

:   The application appears as normal, showing the entire application
    chrome including things like the complete address bar with
    forward/back/home buttons, scrollbar gutters, and so on.

These various states can be triggered either by the user putting the
browser into a given mode (e.g., the user hitting F11 on Windows to
enter full-screen mode), or by a Web Application Manifest's `display`
member. The values are exactly the same in all respects; in fact, the
Web Application Manifest specification just points to the values defined
in the CSS Media Queries Level 5 specification.

Thus, you can do things like define different layouts for different
display modes. Here's a brief example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {display: grid; /* add column and row templates here */}

@media (display-mode: fullscreen) {
	body { /* different column and row templates here */}
}
@media (display-mode: standalone) {
	body { /* more different column and row templates here */}
}
```

This can be especially useful if you intend to have your design used in
multiple contexts, such as in web browsers, as web apps, on kiosks, and
so on.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001721584 primary=""

## Ranged Media Features {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1928}

Now we []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_media_q_ranged primary="media queries (@media)"
secondary="ranged media features" data-type="indexterm"}turn our
attention to the media features that allow ranges, and have `min-` and
[`-max`]{.keep-together} variants in addition to accepting values like
lengths or ratios. They also have a more compact way of formatting value
comparisons, which are discussed in an upcoming
[section.]{.keep-together}

Media features: `width`, `min-width`, `max-width`

:   

    Values: \<*`length`*\>

    :   The []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001667248
        primary="width descriptor, @media" data-type="indexterm"} width
        of the viewport of the user agent. In a screen-media web
        browser, this is the width of the viewport *plus* any
        scrollbars. In paged media, this is the width of the page box,
        which is the area of the page in which content is rendered.
        Thus, `(min-width: 100rem)` applies when the viewport is greater
        than or equal to [100 rem]{.keep-together} wide.

Media features: `height`, `min-height`, `max-height`

:   

    Values: \<*`length`*\>

    :   The height of the viewport of the user agent. In a screen-media
        web browser, this is the height of the viewport plus any
        scrollbars. In paged media, this is the height of the page box.
        Thus, `(height: 60rem)` applies when the viewport's height is
        precisely 60 rems tall.

        the output device, with an *optional* number value representing
        the number of bits used in each color component. Thus, `(color)`
        applies to any device with any color depth at all, whereas
        `(min-color: 4)` means there must be at least 4 bits used per
        color component. Any device that does not support color will
        return `0`.

        output device's color lookup table. Any device that does not use

        *optional* number of bits per pixel in the output device's frame

        `(monochrome)` applies to any monochrome output device, whereas
        `(min-monochrome: 2)` means any monochrome output device with a
        minimum of 2 bits per pixel in the frame buffer.

        primary="resolution descriptor, @media"
        data-type="indexterm"}resolution of the output device in terms
        of pixel density, measured in either dots per inch (dpi) or dots
        per centimeter (dpcm); see the definition of \<*`resolution`*\>
        in the next section for details. If an output device has pixels
        that are not square, the least dense axis is used; for example,
        if a device is 100 dpcm along one axis and 120 dpcm along the
        other, `100` is the value returned. Additionally, in such
        nonsquare cases, a bare `resolution` feature query---that is,
        one without a value---can never match (though `min-resolution`
        and `max-resolution` can). Note that resolution values must be
        not only nonnegative, but also nonzero.

With ranged media feature values, it's common to want to restrict rules
to a specific range with a maximum and minimum. For example, you might
want to apply a certain margin between two display widths, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media (min-width: 20em) and (max-width: 45em) {
	body {margin-inline: 0.75em;}
}
```

Media Queries Level 4 defines a much more compact way to say the same
thing, using standard mathematical expressions like equals, greater
than, less than, and so on. Thus, the previous example could be
rewritten as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media (20em < width < 45em) {
	body {margin-inline: 0.75em;}
}
```

In other []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001549456
primary="> (greater-than sign)"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001548848
primary="greater-than sign (>)" data-type="indexterm"}words, "width is
greater than 20 em and less than 45 em." If you want to have the rules
in that media block apply at exactly 20 and 45 em of width, the `<`
symbols would be written as `<=` instead.

This syntax can be used to limit in only one direction, so to speak, as
this example [illustrates:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media (width < 64rem) {
	/* tiny-width styles go here */
}
@media (width > 192rem) {
	/* enormous-width styles go here */
}
```

Any media feature that accepts a range as a value (see the preceding
section) can use this syntax format. This effectively does away with the
need for `min-` and `max-` prefixes on the feature name, as well as for
complex `and` constructions.

You can also do multiple ranged queries by chaining them with the `and`
combinator, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media (20em < width < 45em) and (resolution =< 600dpi) {
	body {margin-inline: 0.75em;}
}
```

This will add an inline margin to the `<body>` element only when the
width of the display area is between 20 and 45 em, and the output
resolution is below 600 dots per inch.

## Responsive Styling {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1931}

Media []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001396624 primary="media queries (@media)"
secondary="responsive styling using"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001395648
primary="responsive styling, media features"
data-type="indexterm"}queries are the foundation on which the practice
of *responsive web design* is built. By applying different sets of rules
depending on the display environment, it's possible to marry
"mobile-friendly" and "desktop-friendly" styles into a single
stylesheet.

We put these terms in quotes because, as you may have seen in your own
life, the lines between what's mobile and what's desktop are blurred. A
laptop with a touch-sensitive screen that folds all the way back can act
as both a tablet and a laptop, for example. CSS doesn't (yet) have a way
of detecting whether a hinge is open past a certain point, nor whether
the device is held in hand or sitting on a flat surface. Instead,
inferences are drawn from aspects of the media environment, like display
size or display orientation.

A fairly common pattern in responsive design is to define *breakpoints*
for each `@media` block. This often takes the form of certain pixel
widths, like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* …common styles here… */
@media (max-width: 400px) {
    /* …small-screen styles here… */
}
@media (min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
    /* …medium-screen styles here… */
}
@media (min-width: 1001px) {
    /* …big-screen styles here… */
}
```

This makes certain assumptions about what a device can display and how
it will report that, however. For example, the iPhone 6 Plus had a
resolution of 1,242 × 2,208, which it downsampled to 1,080 × 1,920. Even
at the downsampled resolution, that's enough pixels across to qualify
for big-screen styles in the previous example.

But wait! The iPhone 6 Plus also maintained an internal coordinate
system of points that measured 414 × 736. If it decided to use those as
its definition of pixels, which would be entirely valid, then it would
get only the small-screen styles.

The point here isn't to single out the iPhone 6 Plus as uniquely bad,
which it wasn't, but to illustrate the uncertainties of relying on
pixel-based media queries. Browser makers have gone to some effort to
make their browsers behave with some semblance of sanity, but never
quite as much as we'd like, and you never know when a new device's
assumptions will clash with your own.

Other methods are available, though they come with their own
uncertainties. Instead of pixels, you might try em-based measures,
something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* …common styles here… */
@media (max-width: 20em) {
    /* …small-screen styles here… */
}
@media (min-width: 20.01em) and (max-width: 50em) {
    /* …medium-screen styles here… */
}
@media (min-width: 50.01em) {
    /* …big-screen styles here… */
}
```

This ties the breakpoints to text display size rather than pixels, which
is more robust. This isn't perfect either, though: it relies on a
sensible approach to determining the em width of, say, a smartphone. It
also directly relies on the actual font family and size used by the
device, which varies from one device to another.

Here's another seemingly simple query set with potentially surprising
results:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* …common styles here… */
@media (orientation: landscape) {
    /* …wider-than-taller styles here… */
}
@media (orientation: portrait) {
    /* …taller-than-wider styles here… */
}
```

This feels like a good way to tell whether a smartphone is in use: after
all, most of them are taller than they are wide, and most people don't
turn them sideways to read. The wrinkle is that the `orientation`
feature refers to the `height` and `width`; that is, `orientation` is
`portrait` if `height` is equal to or larger than `width`. Not
`device-height` and `device-width`, but `height` and `width`, which
refer to the display area of the user agent.

That means a desktop browser window whose display area (the part inside
the browser chrome) is taller than it is wide, or even perfectly square,
will get the portrait styles. So if you assume "portrait equals
smartphone," some of your desktop users could get a
[surprise.]{.keep-together}

The basic point here is that responsive styling is powerful, and as with
any powerful tool, its use requires a fair amount of thought and care.
Carefully considering the implications of each combination of feature
queries is the minimum requirement for successful
responsiveness.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001243072 primary=""

This is different from the screen, which is a *continuous medium*:
documents are presented as a single, scrollable "page." An analog
example of a continuous medium is a papyrus scroll. Printed material,
such as books, magazines, and laser printouts, are all paged media. So
too are slideshows, which show a series of slides one at a time. Each
slide is a "page" in CSS terms.

to make printouts of your documents more pleasing for the user, from
adjusting page breaking to creating styles meant specifically for print.

Note that print styles would also be applied to the document display in
a print preview mode. Thus, it's possible in some circumstances to see
print styles on a monitor.

::: {#ch21.xhtml_differences-between-screen-and-print .sect2}
## Differences Between Screen and Print {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1934}

Beyond the []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001193584 primary="paged media"
secondary="screen versus print" data-type="indexterm"}obvious physical
differences, stylistic differences also exist between screen and print
design. The most basic involves font choices. Most designers will tell
you that sans-serif fonts are best suited for screen design, but serif
fonts are more readable in print. Thus, you might set up a print
stylesheet that uses Times instead of Verdana for the text in your
document.

Another major difference involves []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001192160
primary="fonts" secondary="sizing" data-type="indexterm"}font sizing. If
you've spent any time at all doing web design, you've probably heard
again and again (and again) that points are a horrible choice for font
sizing on the web. This is basically true, especially if you want your
text to be consistently sized between browsers and operating systems.
However, print design is not web design any more than web design is
print design.

Using points, or even centimeters or picas, is perfectly OK in print
design because printing devices know the physical size of their output
area. If a printer has been loaded with 8.5 × 11 inch paper, that
printer knows it has a printing area that will fit within the edges of a
piece of paper. It also knows how many dots there are in an inch, since
it knows the dpi it's capable of generating. This means that it can cope
with physical-world length units like points.

Many a print stylesheet has started with this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {font: 12pt "Times New Roman", "TimesNR", Times, serif;}
```

It's so traditional, it just might bring a tear of joy to the eye of a
graphic artist reading over your shoulder. But make sure they understand
that points are acceptable only because of the nature of the print
medium---they're still not good for web design.

Alternatively, the lack of []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001168448
primary="colors" secondary="background"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001167600
primary="backgrounds" secondary="colors"
data-type="indexterm"}backgrounds in most printouts might bring a tear
of frustration to that designer's eye. To save users ink, most web
browsers are preconfigured not to print background colors and images. If
the user wants to see those backgrounds in the printout, they have to
change an option in the [preferences.]{.keep-together}

CSS can't do anything to force the printing of backgrounds. However, you
can use a print stylesheet to make backgrounds unnecessary. For example,
you might include this rule in your print stylesheet:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
* {color: black !important; background: transparent !important;}
```

This will do its utmost to ensure that all of your elements print out as
black text and remove any backgrounds you might have assigned in an
all-medium stylesheet. It also makes sure that if you have a web design
that puts yellow text on a dark gray background, a user with a color
printer won't get yellow text on a white piece of paper.

One other difference between paged media and continuous media is that
multicolumn layouts are even harder to use in paged media. Suppose you
have an article with text formatted as two columns. In a printout, the
left side of each page will contain the first column, and the right side
the second. This would force the user to read the left side of every
page, then go back to the beginning of the printout and read the right
side of every page. This is annoying enough on the web, but on paper
it's much worse.

One solution is to use CSS for laying out your two columns (by using
flexbox, perhaps) and then write a print stylesheet that restores the
content to a single column. Thus, you might write something like this
for the screen stylesheet:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
article {display: flex;}
div#leftcol {flex: 0 0 45%;}
div#rightcol {flex: 0 0 5 45%;}
```

Then in your print stylesheet, you would write the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
article {display: block; width: auto;}
```

Alternatively, in user agents that support it, you might define actual
multicolumn layout for both screen and print, and trust the user agents
to do the right thing.

We could spend an entire chapter on the details of print design, but
that really isn't the purpose of this book. Let's start exploring the
details of paged-media CSS and leave the design discussions for another
book.

## Page Size {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1935}

In much the []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_paged_media_size primary="paged media"
secondary="page size" data-type="indexterm"}same way as it defines the
element box, CSS defines a *page box* that describes the components of a
page. A page box is composed of two main regions:

Page area

:   The []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001080448 primary="page area"
    data-type="indexterm"}portion of the page in which the content is
    laid out. This is roughly analogous to the content area of a normal
    element box, to the extent that the edges of the page area act as
    the initial containing block for layout within a page.

Margin area

:   The []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001078304
    primary="margin area, paged media" data-type="indexterm"}area that
    surrounds the page area.

[Figure 21-2](#ch21.xhtml_pagesize-page-box){data-type="xref"} shows the
page box model.

The `@page` block[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_page_block_rule
primary="@page block rule" primary-sortas="page block rule"
data-type="indexterm"} is the method by which settings are made, and the
`size` property[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797001013264 primary="size property"
data-type="indexterm"} is used to define the actual dimensions of the
page box. Here's a simple example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page {size: 7.5in 10in; margin: 0.5in;}
```

`@page` is a block like `@media` is a block, and it can contain any set
of styles. One of them, `size`, makes sense only in the context of an
`@page` block.

This descriptor defines the size of the page area. The value `landscape`
is meant to cause the layout to be rotated 90 degrees, whereas
`portrait` is the normal orientation for Western-language printing.
Thus, you could cause a document to be printed sideways by declaring the
following, with the result shown in
[Figure 21-3](#ch21.xhtml_pagesize-landscape){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page {size: landscape;}

In addition to `landscape` and `portrait`, predefined page-size keywords

  : [Table 21-1. ]{.label}Page-size keywords {#page-size-keywords}

Any one of the keywords can be used to declare a page size. The
following defines a page to be JIS B5 size:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page {size: JIS-B5;}
```

These keywords can be combined with the `landscape` and `portrait`
keywords; thus, to define landscape-oriented North American legal pages,
the following is used:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page {size: landscape legal;}
```

Besides using keywords, it's also possible to define page sizes using
length units. The width is given first, and then the height. Therefore,
the following defines a page area 8 inches wide by 10 inches tall:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page {size: 8in 10in;}
```

The defined area is usually centered within the physical page, with
equal amounts of whitespace on each side. If the defined `size` is
larger than the printable area of the page, the user agent has to decide
what to do to resolve the situation. There is no defined behavior here,
so it's really dealer's choice.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000845088

primary="margins" secondary="paged media"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000824512
primary="paged media" secondary="margins" data-type="indexterm"}includes
the ability to style the margin area of the page box. If you want to
make sure that only a small bit at the center of every 8.5 × 11 inch
page is used to print, you could write this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page {margin: 3.75in;}
```

This would leave a printing area 1 inch wide by 3.5 inches tall.

It is possible to use the length units `em` and `ex` to describe either
the margin area or the page area, at least in theory. The size used is
taken from the page context's font, which is to say, the base font size
used for the content displayed on the page.

## Named Page Types {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1941}

CSS []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_paged_media_name primary="paged media"
secondary="named page types" data-type="indexterm"}enables you to create
different page types using named `@page` rules. Let's say you have a
document on astronomy that is several pages long, and in the middle of
it, a fairly wide table contains a list of the physical characteristics
of all the moons of Saturn. You want to print out the text in portrait
mode, but the table needs to be landscape. Here's how you'd start:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page normal {size: portrait; margin: 1in;}
@page rotate {size: landscape; margin: 0.5in;}
```

Now you just need to apply these page types as needed. The table of
Saturn's moons has an `id` of `moon-data`, so you write the following
rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
body {page: normal;}
table#moon-data {page: rotate;}
```

This []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000697584 primary="page property"
data-type="indexterm"}causes the table to be printed in landscape
orientation, but the rest of the document to be in portrait orientation.
The `page` propery is what makes this possible.

```
As you can see from looking at the value definition, the whole reason
`page` exists is to let you assign named page types to various elements
in your document.

You can use more generic page types through special pseudo-classes. The
`:first` page pseudo-class lets you apply special styles to the first
page in the document. For example, you might want to give the first page
a larger top margin than other pages. Here's how:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page {margin: 3cm;}
@page :first {margin-top: 6cm;}
```

This will yield a 3 cm margin on all pages, with the exception of a 6 cm
top margin on the first page.

In addition to styling the first page, you can also style left and right
pages, emulating the pages to the left and right of a book's spine. You
can style these differently using `:left` and `:right`. For example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page :left {margin-left: 3cm; margin-right: 5cm;}
@page :right {margin-left: 5cm; margin-right: 3cm;}
```

These rules will have the effect of putting larger margins between the
content of the left and right pages, on the sides where the spine of a
book would be. This is a common practice when pages are to be bound
together into a book of some type.

The default value of `auto` means that a page break is not forced to
come before or after an element. This is the same as any normal
printout. The `always` value causes a page break to be placed before (or
after) the styled element.

For example, say the page title is an `<h1>` element, and the section
titles are all `<h2>` elements. We might want a page break right before
the beginning of each section of a document and after the document
title. This would result in the following rules, illustrated in
[Figure 21-4](#ch21.xhtml_pagebreaking-breaks){data-type="xref"}:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {page-break-after: always;}
h2 {page-break-before: always;}
```

<h6 id="ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1946"><span class="label">Figure 21-4.
</span>Inserting page breaks</h6>
</div>
</figure>

If we want the document title to be centered in its page, we'd add rules
to that effect. Since we don't, we just get a straightforward rendering
of each page.

The values `left` and `right` operate in the same manner as always,
except they further define the type of page on which printing can
resume. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h2 {page-break-before: left;}
```

This will force every `<h2>` element to be preceded by enough page
breaks that the `<h2>` will be printed at the top of a left page---that
is, a page surface that would appear to the left of a spine if the
output were bound. In double-sided printing, this would mean printing on
the back of a piece of paper.

So let's assume that, in printing, the element just before an `<h2>` is
printed on a right page. The previous rule would cause a single page
break to be inserted before the `<h2>`, thus pushing it to the next
page. If the next `<h2>` is preceded by an element on a left page,
however, the `<h2>` would be preceded by two page breaks, thus placing
it at the top of the next left page. The right page between the two
would be intentionally left blank. The value `right` has the same basic
effect, except it forces an element to be printed at the top of a right
page preceded by either one or two page breaks.

The companion to `always` is `avoid`, which directs the user agent to do
its best to avoid placing a page break either before or after an
element. To extend the previous example, suppose you have subsections
whose titles are `<h3>` elements. You want to keep these titles together
with the text that follows them, so you want to avoid a page break
following an `<h3>` whenever possible:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h3 {page-break-after: avoid;}
```

Note, though, that the value is called `avoid`, not `never`. There is no
way to absolutely guarantee that a page break will never be inserted
before or after a given element. Consider the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
img {height: 9.5in; width: 8in; page-break-before: avoid;}
h4 {page-break-after: avoid;}
h4 + img {height: 10.5in;}
```

Now, suppose further that an `<h4>` is placed between two images, and
its height calculates to be half an inch. Each image will have to be
printed on a separate page, but the `<h4>` can go only two places: at
the bottom of the page holding the first element, or on the page after
it. If it's placed after the first image, it has to be followed by a
page break, since there's no room for the second image to follow it.

On the other hand, if the `<h4>` is placed on a new page following the
first image, there won't be room on that same page for the second image.
So, again, a page break will occur after the `<h4>`. And, in either
case, at least one image, if not both, will be preceded by a page break.
There's only so much the user agent can do, given a situation like this
one.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000416896 primary=""
startref="ix_page_break_aft_prop"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000415920 primary=""
startref="ix_page_break_bef_prop" data-type="indexterm"}

Situations such as these are rare, but they can happen---for example, in
a document containing nothing but tables preceded by headings. The
tables could print in such a way that they force a heading element to be
followed by a page break, even though the author requested such break
placement be avoided.

The []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000414176
primary="page-break-inside property" data-type="indexterm"}same sorts of
issues can arise with the other page-break property,
`page-break-inside`. Its possible values are more limited than those of
its cousins.

  **Inherited**        Yes
  **Computed value**   As specified
  -------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
With `page-break-inside`, you pretty much have one option other than the
default: you can request that a user agent try to avoid placing page
breaks within an element. If you have a series of `aside` divisions, and
you don't want them broken across two pages, then you could declare the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div.aside {page-break-inside: avoid;}
```

Again, this is a suggestion more than an actual rule. If an aside turns
out to be longer than a page, the user agent can't help but place a page
break inside the element.

These properties have similar aims but approach them from different
angles. The value of `widows` defines the minimum number of line boxes
found in an element that can be placed at the top of a page without
forcing a page break to come before the element. The `orphans` property
has the reverse effect: it gives the minimum number of line boxes that
can appear at the bottom of a page without forcing a page break before
the element.

Let's take `widows` as an example. Suppose you declare the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {widows: 4;}
```

This means that any paragraph can have no fewer than four line boxes
appear at the top of a page. If the layout of the document would lead to
fewer line boxes, the entire paragraph is placed at the top of the page.

Consider the situation shown in
[Figure 21-5](#ch21.xhtml_widows-counting){data-type="xref"}. Cover up
the top part of the figure with your hand so that only the second page
is visible. Notice that there are two line boxes there, from the end of
a paragraph that started on the previous page. Given the default
`widows` value of `2`, this is an acceptable rendering. However, if the
value were `3` or higher, the entire paragraph would appear at the top
of the second page as a single block. This would require that a page
break be inserted before the paragraph in question.

Refer back to
[Figure 21-5](#ch21.xhtml_widows-counting){data-type="xref"}, and this
time cover up the second page with your hand. Notice the four line boxes
at the bottom of the page, at the beginning of the last paragraph. This
is fine as long as the value of `orphans` is `4` or less. If it were `5`
or higher, the paragraph would again be preceded by a page break and be
laid out as a single block at the top of the second page.

One potential pitfall is that both `orphans` and `widows` must be
satisfied. If you declare the following, most paragraphs would be
without an interior page break:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {widows: 30; orphans: 30;}
```

It would take a pretty lengthy paragraph to allow an interior page
break, given those values. If the intent is to prevent interior
breaking, that intent would be better expressed as the follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
p {page-break-inside: avoid;}
```

## Page-Breaking Behavior {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1952}

Because CSS allows for some odd page-breaking styles, it defines a set
of behaviors regarding allowed page breaks and "best" page breaks. These
behaviors serve to guide user agents in how they should handle page
breaking in various circumstances.

Page []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000261024 primary="margin-bottom property"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000260288
primary="margin-top property" data-type="indexterm"}breaks are permitted
in only two generic places. The first of these is between two
block-level boxes. If a page break falls between two block boxes, the
`margin-bottom` value of the element before the page break is reset to
`0`, as is the `margin-top` of the element following the page break.
However, two rules affect whether a page break can fall between two
element boxes:

-   If the []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000256832
    primary="page-break-after property"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000256128
    primary="page-break-before property"
    data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000215360
    primary="forced page break" data-type="indexterm"}value of
    `page-break-after` for the first element---or the value of
    `page-break-before` for the second element---is `always`, `left`, or
    `right`, a page break will be placed between the elements. This is
    true regardless of the value for the other element, even if it's
    `avoid`. (This is a *forced* page break.)

-   If the value of the first element's `page-break-after` value is
    `auto`, and the same is true for the second element's
    `page-break-before` value, and they do not share an ancestor element
    whose `page-break-inside` value is not `avoid`, then a page break
    may be placed between them.

[Figure 21-6](#ch21.xhtml_pagebreaking-potential){data-type="xref"}
illustrates all the possible page-break placements between elements in a
hypothetical document. Forced page breaks are represented as a filled
square, whereas potential (unforced) page breaks are shown as an open
square.

Second, page breaks are allowed between two line boxes inside a
block-level box. This, too, is governed by a pair of rules:

-   A page break may appear between two line boxes only if the number of
    line boxes between the start of the element and the line box before
    the page break would be less than the value of `orphans` for the
    element. Similarly, a page break can be placed only where the number
    of line boxes between the line box after the page break and the end
    of the element is less than the value of `widows`.

-   A page []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000204704
    primary="page-break-inside property" data-type="indexterm"}break can
    be placed between line boxes if the value of `page-break-inside` for
    the element is not `avoid`.

<h6 id="ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1953"><span class="label">Figure 21-6.
</span>Potential page-break placement between block boxes</h6>
</div>
</figure>

In both cases, the second of the two rules controlling page-break
placement is ignored if no page-break placement can satisfy all the
rules. Thus, if an element has been given `page-break-inside: avoid` but
the element is longer than a full page, a page break will be permitted
inside the element, between two line boxes. In other words, the second
rule regarding page-break placement between line boxes is ignored.

If ignoring the second rule in each pair of rules still does not yield
good page-break placement, other rules can also be ignored. In such a
situation, the user agent is likely to ignore all page-break property
values and proceed as if they were all `auto`, although this approach is
not defined (or required) by the CSS specification.

In addition to the previously explored rules, CSS defines a set of best
page-breaking behaviors:

-   Break as few times as possible.

-   Make all pages that don't end with a forced break appear to have
    about the same height.

-   Avoid breaking inside a block that has a border.

-   Avoid breaking inside a table.

-   Avoid breaking inside a floated element.

These recommendations aren't required of user agents, but they offer
logical guidance that should lead to ideal page-breaking
behaviors.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000192672 primary=""

## Repeated Elements {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1954}

A very []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000189008 primary="paged media"
secondary="repeated elements on every page" data-type="indexterm"}common
desire in paged media is the ability to have a *running head*. This is
an element that appears on every page, such as the document's title or
the author's name. This is possible in CSS by using a fixed-position
element:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#runhead {position: fixed; top: 0; right: 0;}
```

This will place any `<div>` with an `id` of `runhead` at the top-right
corner of every page box when the document is outputted to a paged
medium. The same rule would place the element in the top-right corner of
the viewport in a continuous medium, such as a web browser. Any element
positioned in this way will appear on every page. It is not possible to
copy an element to become a repeated element. Thus, given the following,
the `<h1>` element will appear as a running head on every page,
including the first one:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {position: fixed; top: 0; width: 100%; text-align: center;
    font-size: 80%; border-bottom: 1px solid gray;}
```

The drawback is that the `<h1>` element, being positioned on the first
page, cannot be printed as anything except the running head.

Eventually, we will be able to add content directly into the margins of
a printed page with the `@page`'s margin at-rules. The following would
place "table of contents" in the top middle of a printed page containing
an element with `page: toc` set:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@page toc {
    size: a4 portrait;
    @top-middle {
        content: "Table of contents";
    }
}
```

## Elements Outside the Page {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1955}

All []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000062976 primary="paged media"
secondary="elements outside the page" data-type="indexterm"}this talk of
positioning elements in a paged medium leads to an interesting question:
what happens if an element is positioned outside the page box? You don't
even need positioning to create such a situation. Think about a `<pre>`
element that contains a line with 411 characters. This is likely to be
wider than any standard piece of paper, and so the element will be wider
than the page box. What will happen then?

As it turns out, CSS doesn't say exactly what user agents should do, so
it's up to each one to come up with a solution. For a very wide `<pre>`
element, the user agent might clip the element to the page box and throw
away the rest of the content. It could also generate extra pages to
display the leftover part of the element.

CSS has a few general recommendations for handling content outside the
page box, and two that are really important. First, content should be
allowed to protrude slightly from a page box in order to allow bleeding.
This implies that no extra page would be generated for the portions of
such content that exceed the page box but do not extend all the way off
the page.

Second, user agents are cautioned not to generate large numbers of empty
pages for the sole purpose of honoring positioning information. Consider
the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
h1 {position: absolute; top: 1500in;}
```

Assuming that the page boxes are 10 inches high, the user agent would
have to precede an `<h1>` with 150 page breaks (and thus 150 blank
pages) just to honor that rule. Instead, a user agent might choose to
skip the blank pages and output only the last one, which actually
contains the `<h1>` element.

The other two recommendations in the specification state that user
agents should not position elements in strange places just to avoid
rendering them, and that content placed outside a page box can be
rendered in any of a number of ways. (Some of the commentary in CSS is
useful and intriguing, but some seems to exist solely to cheerily state
the [obvious.]{.keep-together})[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45797000022848

# Container Queries {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1956}

As []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_container_queries primary="container queries"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_atrule_contain
primary="at-rules" secondary="container queries"
data-type="indexterm"}media queries are to media contexts, so container
queries are to containment contexts. Rather than saying you want to
change the layout of a piece of your design because of changes in the
display size, you can have those changes come from changes in their
parent element's size.

For example, you might have a page header containing a logo, some navbar
links, and a search box. By default, the search box is narrow, so as not
to take up too much space. Once it gains focus, though, it gets wider.
In this situation, you might want to change the layout and sizing of the
logo and links, thus giving way to the search box without disappearing
entirely or being overlaid. Here's how you could set that up:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<header id="site">
  <nav>
    <a href="…"><img src="/i/logo.png" alt="ConHugeCo"></a>
    <a href="…">Products</a>
    <a href="…">Services</a>
    <!-- and so on -->
  </nav>
  <form>
    <!-- search form is here -->
  </form>
</header>
```

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header#site nav {container: headernav / size;}

@container headernav (width < 50%) {
	/* style changes to be applied to elements when the nav element

}
```

## Defining Container Types {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1958}

There are a []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_contain_q_types
primary="container queries" secondary="types of containers"
data-type="indexterm"}couple of ways to define the type of container,
while also setting the kinds of containment (see `contain` in
[Chapter 20](../Text/ch20.xhtml#filters-compositing){data-type="xref"})
that are enabled for the container. It's all managed through the
`container-type` property.

```{=html}
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar">
```
::: {#ch21.xhtml_idm45796999877552 .sidebar}
# container-type {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1959}

  -------------------- -------------------------------------
  **Value**            `normal` \| `size` \| `inline-size`
  **Initial value**    `normal`
  **Applies to**       All elements
  **Computed value**   As declared
  **Inherited**        No
  **Animatable**       No
  -------------------- -------------------------------------
:::

```{=html}
</aside>
```
When using the default value, `normal`, a container can be queried on
specific property-value combinations. Suppose you want to apply certain
styles if a container has a specific side padding value. That would look
something like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header#site nav {
	container-type: normal; /* default value */
	container-name: headernav;
}

@container headernav style(padding-inline: 1em) {
	/* style changes to be applied to elements when the nav element
	   specifically has 1em inline padding, and no other value(s) */
}
```

Inside a `style()` function, any property and value combination can be
used, including those involving custom properties, and will match as
long as that precise combination is in effect. You could, for example,
change the color of heading text based on the value of a text-sizing
custom property:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
main > section {
	container: pagesection / normal;
}

@container pagesection style(--textSize: x-small) {
	h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {color: black;}
}
@container pagesection style(--textSize: normal) {
	h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {color: #222;}
}
@container pagesection style(--textSize: x-big) {
	h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {color: #444;}
}
```

You can also query specific sizing values, such as `(width: 30em)`, but
that queries only the value of the CSS property, not the rendered size
of the container. If you want to perform range-based sizing queries,
you'll have to use one of the other values of `container-type`: `size`
or `inline-size`.

If you declare `container-type: size`, you're able to query on both the
inline and block axes. Thus you could, for example, set up a query that
relates to both sizes of the container like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header#site nav {
	container-type: size
	container-name: headernav;
}

@container headernav (block-size < 6rem) and (inline-size < 50vmin) {
	/* style changes to be applied to elements when the nav element
	   has a block size below 6rem AND an inline size below 50vmin */
}
```

If you care about only the inline size, using `inline-size` instead
might make more sense, as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header#site nav {
	container-type: inline-size
	container-name: headernav;
}

@container headernav (inline-size => 50vmin) {
	/* style changes to be applied to elements when the nav element
	   has an inline size greater than or equal to 50vmin */
}
```

What's the real difference, besides one of them allowing for block-axis
queries? Both values set layout and style containment (see the `contain`
property in
[Chapter 20](../Text/ch20.xhtml#filters-compositing){data-type="xref"}),
but `size` sets size containment, whereas `inline-size` sets inline-size
containment. This makes some sense, given their respective names. If
you're always going to do only inline querying, use `inline-size` so as
to keep the block direction uncontained.

Throughout this section, we've been setting a container name without
having really talked about it, so let's talk about it
now.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796999517312 primary=""

Pretty much anytime you set a container, you should set a container
name---or names. Both of the following rules are legal:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header {container-name: pageHeader;}
footer {container-name: pageFooter full-width nav_element;}
```

OK, you probably shouldn't be mixing camelCase, dash-separated, and
underscore_separated naming conventions, but otherwise, everything's
fine. The `<header>` elements will be given the container name
`pageHeader`, while `<footer>` elements will be given all three
container names listed. This allows you to apply different container
queries for different things, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@container pageFooter (width < 40em) {
	/* rules for elements in narrow footers go here */
}
@container nav_element (height > 5rem) {
	/* rules for elements in tall elements that contain navigation go here */
}
@container full-width style(border-style: solid) {
	/* rules for elements in full-width containers go here */
}
```

We can turn this around and assign the same container name to a bunch of
elements:[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796999388064 primary=""

If you want to define the container name and type in one handy
declaration, this is the property for you. As an example, the following
two rules are precisely equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header#page nav {
	container-name: headerNav;
	container-type: size;
}
header#page nav {
	container: headerNav / size;
}
```

In the `container` value, the name must always be present and must
always come first. If a container type is defined, it must come second
and follow a forward slash (`/`). If no container type is given, the
initial value of `normal` is used. Thus, the following rules are
precisely equivalent:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
footer#site nav {
	container-name: footerNav;
	container-type: normal;
}
footer#site nav {
	container: footerNav / normal;
}
footer#site nav {
	container: footerNav;
}
```

As with `container-name`, you can include a space-separated list of
names, like so:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
footer#site nav {
	container: footerNav fullWidth linkContainer / normal;
}
```

So those are the ways to set container names and types. You've seen that
the [`@container`]{.keep-together} block is used to invoke these, and
now it's time to discuss exactly how that works.

::: {#ch21.xhtml_container-at-blocks .sect2}
## Using Container At-Rules {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1964}

The []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_contain_q_atrules primary="container queries"
secondary="at-rules for" data-type="indexterm"}syntax of container query
blocks will seem familiar if you read the earlier sections on media
queries, because the syntax is nearly the same. The only real difference
is that container queries use an optional container name and the
`style()` function. Here's the basic syntax format:

``` {data-type="programlisting"}
@container <container-name>? <container-condition> {
	/* CSS rules go here */
}
```

You don't have to include a container name, but if you do, it must go
first. (We'll talk about what happens if you don't in just a bit.) There
must, however, be a condition of some sort---some sort of query. It
wouldn't be a container query without one, after all.

As with []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796999128400 primary="not logical keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}media queries, you can use the `and`, `not`, and
`or` modifiers to set up your queries. Suppose you want to match a
container that does *not* have a dashed border. That goes something like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@container not style(border-style: dashed) {
	/* CSS rules go here */
}
```

Or perhaps you want to apply some rules when a container named
`fullWidth` is in a certain size range but also doesn't have a dashed
border:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@container fullWidth (inline-size > 30em) and not style(border-style: dashed) {
	/* CSS rules go here */
}
```

Note []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796999062128 primary="container queries"
secondary="naming containers" data-type="indexterm"}that you can list
only one container name; there is no way to combine them in a single
query block, whether with commas or logical combinators like `and`. As
with all query blocks, though, you can nest container queries, such as
these:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@container fullWidth (inline-size > 30em) and not style(border-style: dashed) {
	@container headerNav (inline-size > 30em) {
		/* CSS rules go here */
	}
}
```

This will be matched, and the styles applied, to elements when they have
a `fullWidth` container with an inline size above 30 em and a not-dashed
border style, and also a `headerNav` container with an inline size above
30 em. And the same element could be both containers!

This brings us to the question of how, exactly, an element knows which
containers are being queried. Let's extend an earlier example a bit and
fill in the actual CSS rules:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@container fullWidth (inline-size > 30em) and not style(border-style: dashed) {
	nav {display: flex; gap: 0.5em;}
}
```

How does a given `<nav>` element on the page know when it's matched by a
container query? By looking up its ancestor tree to see if there are any
containers above it in the tree. If there are, and they match the name
that appears in the container block surrounding it, and the specified
query matches the container type, then the query is made. If it returns
true, the styles in the container block are applied. Let's see that in
action. Here's a document skeleton:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
html
  body
    header.page
      img
      nav
        (links here)
    main
      h1
      aside
        nav
      p
      p
      p
      p
    footer.page
      nav
        (links here)
      img
```

To that markup, we'll apply the following styles:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
header.page {container: headerNav fullWidth / size;}
footer.page {container: fullWidth / size;}
body, main {container-type: normal;}

nav {display: flex; gap: 0.5em;}

@container fullWidth (inline-size < 30em) {
	nav {flex-direction: column; padding-block: 4em;}
}
@container headerNav (block-size > 25vh) {
	nav {font-size: smaller; padding-block: 0; margin-block: 0;}
}
@container style(background-color: blue;) {
	nav {color: white;}
	nav a {color: inherit; font-weight: bold;}
}
```

In the markup, we have three `<nav>` elements, and in the CSS we have
three container blocks. Let's consider the blocks one by one.

The first container query block says to all `<nav>` elements, "If you
have a container with a name of `fullWidth`, and that container's inline
size is less than 30 em, then you get these styles." The header and
footer `<nav>` elements do have containers named `fullWidth`: the
`<header>` and `<footer>` elements both have that name. Their container
types are also `size`, so checking the inline size is valid. So they
check the inline sizes of their respective containers to see if the
styles will be applied.

Note that this happens per container. The header might be 40 em wide and
the footer only 25 em wide because of other layout styles (a grid
template, for example). In that case, the change of flex direction will
be applied to the footer's `<nav>`, but not the header's `<nav>`. As for
the `<nav>` inside the `<main>` element, it doesn't have any containers
labeled `fullWidth`, so it gets skipped over regardless of the condition
query.

The second container query block says to all `<nav>` elements, "If you
have a container named `headerNav`, and that container's block size is
greater than 25 vh, you get these styles." The only container on the
page with a container name of `headerNav` is the
`<header class="page">`, so its `<nav>` checks the block size of the
container, and applies the styles if the container's block size is above
25 vh. The other two `<nav>` elements skip this entirely, because none
of their containers are named `headerNav`.

The third container query block is more vague. It says to all `<nav>`
elements, "If you have a container and its background is blue, then you
get these styles." Note that there's no container name, so the header
`<nav>` checks its nearest-ancestor container, which is `header.page`,
to see if it's set to `background-color: blue`. Let's assume it isn't,
so these styles aren't applied.

The same thing happens for the `<nav>` inside the `<main>` and the
footer, as well any `<a>` elements inside them. We already established
that its background color isn't blue in the previous paragraph, so if
`<main>` or the footer have their background color set to `blue`, then
their respective `<nav>` elements and their links will get those styles;
otherwise, they won't.

Remember that a container query matters only if an element matches the
selectors inside the query block. Imagine someone writing something like
this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@container (orientation: portrait) {
	body > main > aisde.sidebar ol li > ul li > ol {
		display: flex;
	}
}
```

Only an element that matches that long and very specific selector can
check its containers to see if any of them are in `portrait`
orientation, and even an element that matches the selector won't get the
styles if it doesn't have any containers. Otherwise, the query is kind
of moot. This speaks to the necessity of making sure your selectors will
match before you worry about querying any containers, and then making
sure your matched elements have containers to
query.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796998616208 primary=""

## Defining Container Query Features {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1965}

You can []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796998614080 primary="container queries"
secondary="features" data-type="indexterm"}check seven features in a
container query, most of which you've seen previously, but a couple of
which we haven't touched on. They're summarized here:

Feature: `block-size`

:   

    Value: \<*`length`*\>

    :   Queries the block size of the query container's content box.

Feature: `inline-size`

:   

    Value: \<*`length`*\>

    :   Queries the inline size of the query container's content box.

Feature: `width`

:   

    Value: \<*`length`*\>

    :   Queries the physical width of the query container's content box.

Feature: `height`

:   

    Value: \<*`length`*\>

    :   Queries the physical height of the query container's content
        box.

Feature: `aspect-ratio`

:   

    Value: \<*`ratio`*\>

    :   Queries the ratio of the physical width as compared to the
        physical height of the query container's content box.

Feature: `orientation`

:   

    Value: `portrait` \| `landscape`

    :   Queries the physical width and height of the query container's
        content box. The container is considered to be `landscape` if
        its width is greater than its height; otherwise, the container
        is considered to be `portrait`.

These do not have `min-` and `max-` prefixed variants. Instead, the
math-style range notation we covered previously is used.

## Setting Container Length Units {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1966}

In []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796998580624 primary="units of measure"
secondary="lengths for container queries"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_contain_q_length
primary="container queries" secondary="length units"
data-type="indexterm"}addition to querying containers, you can also
style elements with length values based on their containers' sizes, very
much like the viewport-relative length units discussed in
[Chapter 5](../Text/ch05.xhtml#values_and_units){data-type="xref"}.
These are as follows:

`cqb`

:   1% of the container's block size

`cqi`

:   1% of the container's inline size

`cqh`

:   1% of the container's physical height

`cqw`

:   1% of the container's physical width

`cqmin`

:   Equivalent to `cqb` or `cqi`, whichever is *smaller*

`cqmax`

:   Equivalent to `cqb` or `cqi`, whichever is *larger*

Thus you could set up an element such that at smaller container sizes,
its children are the full width of the container, but at larger sizes
they're some fraction of the container's width. This could be done with
grid tracks, for example:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div.card {
	container: card / inline-size;
}

@container card (width > 45em) {
	div.card > ul {
		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 30cqw);
		justify-content: space-between;
	}
}
```

Here, if the container is above 45 em in width, a `<ul>` that is a child
of `div.card` will be turned into a grid container, with columns that
are sized based on the container's width. This is illustrated in
[Figure 21-7](#ch21.xhtml_container-query-units){data-type="xref"}.

</figure>

The advantage here is mostly in applications like web components, for
which it may be desirable to size elements based on the size of the
container, even though the container may appear in a wide variety of
sizing conditions.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796998514704 primary=""

# Feature Queries (@supports) {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1968}

CSS has the []{#ch21.xhtml_ix_supports_feat_queries
primary="@supports (feature query) rule"
primary-sortas="supports (feature query) rule"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_feat_queries
primary="feature queries"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_ix_atrule_feat_queries
primary="at-rules" secondary="feature queries"
data-type="indexterm"}ability to apply rules when certain CSS
property-value combinations are supported by the user agent. These are
known as *feature queries*.

Say you want to apply color to an element only if `color` is a supported
property. (Which it certainly should be!) That would look like the
following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (color: black) {
    body {color: black;}
    h1 {color: purple;}
    h2 {color: navy;}
}
```

This says, in effect, "If you recognize and can do something with the
property-value combination `color: black`, apply these styles.
Otherwise, skip these styles." In user agents that don't understand
`@supports`, the entire block is skipped over.

Feature queries are a perfect way to progressively enhance your styles.
For example, suppose you want to add some grid layout to your existing
float-and-inline-block layout. You can keep the old layout scheme and
then later in the stylesheet include a block like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (display: grid ) {
    section#main {display: grid;}
    /* styles to switch off old layout positioning */
    /* grid layout styles */
}
```

This block of styles will be applied in browsers that understand grid
display, overriding the old styles that governed page layout, and then
applying the styles needed to make things work in a grid-based future.
Browsers too old to understand grid layout are too old to understand
`@supports`, so they'll skip the whole block entirely, as if it had
never been there.

Feature queries can be embedded inside each other, and indeed can be
embedded inside media blocks, as well as vice versa. You could write
screen and print styles based on flexible-box layout, and wrap those
media blocks in an `@supports (display: flex)` block:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (display: flex) {
    @media screen {
        /* screen flexbox styles go here */
    }
    @media print {
        /* print flexbox styles go here */
    }
}
```

Conversely, you could add `@supports()` blocks inside various
responsive-design media query blocks:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@media screen and (max-width: 30em){
    @supports (display: flex) {
        /* small-screen flexbox styles go here */
    }
}
@media screen and (min-width: 30em) {
    @supports (display: flex) {
        /* large-screen flexbox styles go here */
    }
}
```

The way you organize these blocks is really up to you. The same holds
true for container queries, which can be nested inside feature queries,
or vice versa. In fact, you can nest the various kinds of queries inside
each other, or themselves, in any combination that makes sense for your
situation (and to you).

As with []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796998281488 primary="and logical keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}media queries, feature queries also permit logical
operators. Suppose we want to apply styles only if a user agent supports
both grid layout *and* CSS shapes. Here's how that might go:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (display: grid) and (shape-outside: circle()) {
    /* grid-and-shape styles go here */
}
```

This is essentially equivalent to writing the following:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (display: grid) {
    @supports (shape-outside: circle()) {
        /* grid-and-shape styles go here */
    }
}
```

However, there's more than "and" operations available. CSS Shapes
(covered in detail in
[Chapter 20](../Text/ch20.xhtml#filters-compositing){data-type="xref"})
are a good example of why "or" is useful, because for a long time WebKit
supported CSS shapes only via vendor-prefixed properties. So if you want
to use shapes, you can use a feature query like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (shape-outside: circle()) or
          (-webkit-shape-outside: circle()) {
        /* shape styles go here */
}
```

You'd still have to make sure to use both prefixed and unprefixed
versions of the shape properties, but this would let you add support for
those properties backward in the WebKit release line while supporting
other browsers that also support shapes via nonprefixed properties.

All this is handy because at times you might want to apply different
properties than those you're testing. So, to go back to grid layout for
a second, you might want to change the margins and so forth on your
layout elements when a grid is in use. Here's a simplified version of
that approach:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
div#main {overflow: hidden;}
div.column {float: left; margin-right: 1em;}
div.column:last-child {margin-right: 0;}

@supports (display: grid) {
    div#main {display: grid; gap: 1em 0;
            overflow: visible;}
    div#main div.column {margin: 0;}
}
```

It's []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796998106416 primary="not logical keyword"
data-type="indexterm"}possible to use negation as well. For example, you
could apply the following styles when grid layout is *not* supported:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports not (display: grid) {
    /* grid-not-supported styles go here */
}
```

You can combine your logical operators into a single query, but
parentheses are required to keep the logic straight. Suppose we want a
set of styles to be applied when color is supported, and when one of
either grid or flexible box layout is supported. That's written [like
this:]{.keep-together}

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (color: black) and ((display: flex) or (display: grid)) {
        /* styles go here */
}
```

Notice that []{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997980528
primary="or logical keyword" data-type="indexterm"}there's another set
of parentheses around the "or" part of the logic, enclosing the grid and
flex tests. Those extra parentheses are required. Without them, the
entire expression will fail, and the styles inside the block will be
skipped. In other words, *don't* do this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
/* the following will not work and is a bad idea */
@supports (color: black) and (display: flex) or (display: grid) {
```

Finally, you might wonder why both a property and value are required in
feature query tests. After all, if you're using shapes, all you need to
test for is `shape-outside`, right? It's because a browser can easily
support a property without supporting all its values. Grid layout is a
perfect example. Suppose you try to test for grid support like this:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@supports (display) {
    /* grid styles go here */
}
```

Well, even Internet Explorer 4 supported `display`. Any browser that
understands `@supports` will certainly understand `display` and many of
its values---but maybe not `grid`. That's why property and value are
always tested in feature queries.

::: {.warning data-type="warning"}
###### Warning {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1969}

Remember that these are *feature* queries, not *correctness* queries. A
browser can understand the feature you're testing for, but implement it
with bugs, or parse it correctly without actually supporting the
intended behavior. In other words, you're not getting an assurance from
the browser that it supports something correctly. All a positive
feature-query result means is that the browser understands what you've
said.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997925264 primary=""

::: {#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997862704 .sect2}
## Defining a Character Set for a Stylesheet {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1971}

The `@charset` at-rule[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997860752
primary="at-rules" secondary="@charset" secondary-sortas="charset"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997859472
primary="@charset rule" primary-sortas="charset rule"
data-type="indexterm"} is a way to set a specific character set for a
stylesheet. For example, you may have received a stylesheet in the
UTF-16 character encoding. That would be marked as follows:

``` {code-language="css" data-type="programlisting"}
@charset "UTF-16";
```

In a departure from the rest of CSS, the syntax here is very exacting.
There must be exactly one space (which must be the space defined by
Unicode code point U+0020) between the `@charset` and the quoted value,
the value must be quoted, and it can be quoted using only double quotes.
In addition, you cannot have space of any kind before the `@charset`; it
must be the first thing on the line.

Furthermore, if you need to include `@charset`, it must be the very
first thing in the stylesheet, before any other at-rule or regular rule.
If you list more than one `@charset`, the first will be used, and the
rest ignored.

And finally, the only acceptable values are character encodings defined
in the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml).

Use of `@charset` is vanishingly rare, so unless explicitly declaring
the encoding of a specific stylesheet is absolutely required to make
things work, don't worry about it.

## Defining a Namespace for Selectors {#ch21.xhtml_sigil_toc_id_1972}

The `@namespace` at-rule[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997846880
primary="at-rules" secondary="@namespace for selectors"
secondary-sortas="namespace for selectors"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997845744
primary="@namespace rule" primary-sortas="namespace rule"
data-type="indexterm"}[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997844800
primary="selectors" secondary="@namespace rule for"
secondary-sortas="namespace rule for" data-type="indexterm"} allows you
to use XML namespaces in your stylesheets. The value of `@namespace` is
the URL of a document defining the namespace, like this:

``` {code-language="xml" data-type="programlisting"}
<style>
@namespace xhtml url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
@namespace svg url(http://www.w3.org/2000/svg);

xhtml|a {color: navy;}
svg|a {color: red;}
a {background: yellow;}
</style>
```

Given the previous CSS, `<a>` elements in XHTML would be navy on yellow,
and `<a>` elements in SVG would be red on yellow. This is why selectors
without namespaces work across all markup languages: no namespace means
no restriction.

Any `@namespace` at-rules must come after any `@charset` or `@import`
at-rules, but before any other stylesheet content, whether other
at-rules or normal rules. The `@namespace` at-rule is rarely used
outside of test pages, but if you need to use it, the capability is
there.[]{#ch21.xhtml_idm45796997799312 primary=""

Thanks to the flexibility of at-rules, it is possible to provide a wide
range of design experiences from within a single set of styles. Whether
reorganizing a page to account for varying display sizes, reworking the
color scheme to support grayscale printing, or restyling content based
on elements that contain them, you have the ability to do a great deal
to make your work the best it can be.

# About the Authors

**Eric A. Meyer** has been working with the web since late 1993 and is
an internationally recognized expert on the subjects of HTML, CSS, and
web standards. A widely read author, he joined Igalia in 2021 as a
developer advocate and standards evangelist, a role he originally
performed for Netscape Communications in 2001.

Beginning in early 1994, Eric was the visual designer and campus web
coordinator for the Case Western Reserve University website, where he
also authored a widely acclaimed series of three HTML tutorials and was
project coordinator for the online version of the *Encyclopedia of
Cleveland History* and the *Dictionary of Cleveland Biography*, the
first encyclopedia of urban history published fully and freely on the
web.

He is the author of *Design for Real Life* (A Book Apart), *Eric Meyer
on CSS* and *More Eric Meyer on CSS* (New Riders), [*CSS: The Definitive
Guide*,
4e](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/css-the-definitive/9781449325053){.orm:hideurl}
(O'Reilly), and *CSS2.0 Programmer's Reference* (Osborne/McGraw-Hill),
as well as numerous articles for A List Apart, Net Magazine, Netscape
DevEdge, UX Booth, UX Matters, the O'Reilly Network, Web Techniques, and
Web Review. Eric also created the classic CSS Browser Compatibility
Charts (a.k.a. "The Mastergrid") and coordinated the authoring and
creation of the W3C's first official [CSS Test
Suite](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/current){.orm:hideurl}.

He has conducted customized training for a wide variety of organizations
through his independent consulting, and has delivered keynotes and
technical talks at numerous conferences around the world. In 2006, he
was inducted into the [International Academy of Digital Arts and
Sciences](http://iadas.net){.orm:hideurl} for "international recognition
on the topics of HTML and CSS" and helping to "inform excellence and
efficiency on the Web." In December 2014, he accidentally touched off
Slate's Internet Outrage of the Day.

In his personal time, Eric acts as list chaperone of the [css-discuss
mailing list](http://www.css-discuss.org), which he cofounded with John
Allsopp of Western Civilisation, and which is now supported by
[*evolt.org*](http://evolt.org). Eric lives in Cleveland, Ohio, which is
a much nicer city than you've been led to believe. For nine years he was
the host of "Your Father's Oldsmobile," a big-band radio show heard
weekly on WRUW 91.1 FM in Cleveland. He's a staunch defender of the
Oxford comma and the right of everyone everywhere to follow a sentence
with however many spaces they deem proper. He enjoys a good meal
whenever he can and considers almost every form of music to be
worthwhile.

How does someone get to be the author of *Flexbox in CSS*, *Transitions
and Animations in CSS*, and [*Mobile
HTML5*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mobile-html5/9781491948903){.orm:hideurl}
(O'Reilly), and coauthor of *CSS3 for the Real World* (SitePoint) and
*CSS: The Definitive Guide*? For **Estelle Weyl**, the journey was not a
direct one. She started out as an architect, used her master's degree in
health and social behavior from the Harvard School of Public Health to
lead teen health programs, and then began dabbling in website
development. By the time Y2K rolled around, she had become somewhat
known as a web standardista at
[*http://www.standardista.com*](http://www.standardista.com){.orm:hideurl}.

Today, she writes a technical blog that pulls in millions of visitors,
and speaks about CSS, HTML, JavaScript, accessibility, and web
performance at conferences around the world. In addition to sharing
esoteric programming tidbits with her reading public, Estelle has
consulted for Kodak Gallery, SurveyMonkey, Visa, Samsung, Yahoo!, Apple,
Williams-Sonoma, and Google Chrome's Web.Dev, where she wrote [Learn
HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html), among others. She is currently a
technical writer for Open Web Docs working on MDN.

When not coding, she spends her time cooking, gardening, and doing
construction, striving to update her 1910s-throwback home. Basically,
it's just one more way Estelle is working to bring the world into the
21st century.

The animals on the cover of *CSS: The Definitive Guide* are salmon
(*salmonidae*), which is a family of fish consisting of many species.
Two of the most common salmon are the Pacific salmon and the Atlantic
salmon.

Pacific salmon live in the northern Pacific Ocean off the coasts of
North America and Asia. There are five subspecies of Pacific salmon,
with an average weight of 10 to 30 pounds. Pacific salmon are born in
the fall in freshwater stream gravel beds, where they incubate through
the winter and emerge as inch-long fish. They live for a year or two in
streams or lakes and then head downstream to the ocean. There they live
for a few years, before heading back upstream to their exact place of
birth to spawn and then die.

Atlantic salmon live in the northern Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of
North America and Europe. There are many subspecies of Atlantic salmon,
including the trout and the char. Their average weight is 10 to 20
pounds. The Atlantic salmon family has a life cycle similar to that of
its Pacific cousins, and also travels from freshwater gravel beds to the
sea. A major difference between the two, however, is that the Atlantic
salmon does not die after spawning; it can return to the ocean and back
to spawn again, usually two or three times.

Salmon, in general, are graceful, silver-colored fish with spots on
their backs and fins. Their diet consists of plankton, insect larvae,
shrimp, and smaller fish. Their unusually keen sense of smell is thought
to help them navigate from the ocean back to the exact spot of their
birth, upstream past many obstacles. Some species of salmon remain
landlocked, living their entire lives in fresh water.

Salmon are an important part of their ecosystems; their decaying bodies
provide fertilizer for streambeds. Their numbers have been dwindling
over the years, however. Factors in the declining salmon population
include habitat destruction, fishing, dams that block spawning paths,
acid rain, droughts, floods, and pollution.
